00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:11,730
[Music]

2
00:00:23,759 --> 00:00:34,140
that's a hell of a welcome for someone

3
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:36,460
who's gonna talk about the Bible so I

4
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:39,280
thought I would get farther than through

5
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:41,530
Genesis by by this point but I'm not

6
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,120
unhappy about the pace either I've

7
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:45,809
learned a tremendous amount and so

8
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:50,379
hopefully what we'll do today is finish

9
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:53,129
Genesis completely and then I think I'll

10
00:00:50,379 --> 00:00:56,079
try to start up with Exodus in May

11
00:00:53,129 --> 00:00:58,329
depending on what happens next year I

12
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:59,769
have a busy travel schedule and but I

13
00:00:58,329 --> 00:01:01,629
would really like to do it I really like

14
00:00:59,769 --> 00:01:03,579
the Exodus story and I understand it

15
00:01:01,629 --> 00:01:06,490
very well a lot of the stories in

16
00:01:03,579 --> 00:01:08,200
Genesis especially after the first few

17
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:09,460
stories say up to the Tower of Babel I

18
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,170
had to do a tremendous amount of

19
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:13,510
learning about which is really good but

20
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:17,590
I do know the Exodus story so I'm really

21
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:19,330
looking forward to that so so let's dive

22
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:24,610
right into it and see how far we can get

23
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:27,720
today so we'll review first so Joseph's

24
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:30,580
father is Jacob and Jacob is the

25
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:35,950
patriarch of Israel essentially that the

26
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:43,950
father of the twelve tribes and we might

27
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:43,950
remember that he had a very morally

28
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:50,200
ambivalent pathway through life and it's

29
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:52,900
one of the things that I think so

30
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:57,610
interesting about the stories in the in

31
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:59,980
the Old Testament is that these so

32
00:01:57,610 --> 00:02:03,100
called patriarchal figures are very

33
00:01:59,980 --> 00:02:05,140
realistic and it's something that I was

34
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:07,090
also being struck by that accounts in

35
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:10,629
the New Testament that way there's lots

36
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:12,190
of things that Christ does that you'd

37
00:02:10,629 --> 00:02:14,200
think would have been edited out over

38
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:15,519
time and sanitized but they're not and

39
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,140
that the Old Testament is definitely not

40
00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:17,790
a book that's been sanitized and that's

41
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,079
it

42
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:22,260
quite interesting that that's the case

43
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:26,340
so you sort of see people with all their

44
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:29,719
flaws and I've been trying to also

45
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:32,760
derive some general conclusions about

46
00:02:29,719 --> 00:02:35,310
them the moral of the story of the

47
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:37,079
Genesis stories and because these

48
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:39,090
stories are fundamentally moral and

49
00:02:37,079 --> 00:02:42,269
moral as far as I'm concerned has to do

50
00:02:39,090 --> 00:02:43,889
with action right because moral

51
00:02:42,269 --> 00:02:45,959
decisions are the decisions that you

52
00:02:43,889 --> 00:02:47,780
make when you're structuring action when

53
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:50,099
you decide to do one thing or another

54
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:52,290
generally you want to do things that are

55
00:02:50,099 --> 00:02:56,010
the best things that you can think of to

56
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:57,239
do and hence good but sometimes you also

57
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:58,739
want to do things that are they're worse

58
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:01,439
things you can do you know because

59
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:03,659
you're angry or resentful or bitter and

60
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:06,030
so the moral decisions that you make

61
00:03:03,659 --> 00:03:07,470
that govern your actions are really the

62
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:09,389
most important decisions that you make

63
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:12,120
in your life and it's not that easy to

64
00:03:09,389 --> 00:03:16,980
figure out how to make moral decisions

65
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:18,959
we don't have an unerring technology for

66
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:20,970
that the same way as we do for say

67
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:24,620
making decisions about empirical reality

68
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:26,699
which in some ways seem a lot simpler

69
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:28,139
partly because we can work collectively

70
00:03:26,699 --> 00:03:30,000
at it partly because we have a rigorous

71
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:34,019
methodology for deciding what's true and

72
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,729
what's not so one of the things that's

73
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:37,680
really struck me like it's an

74
00:03:35,729 --> 00:03:39,810
overarching theme I would say that the

75
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:43,069
emerges out of Genesis especially after

76
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:47,220
the really ancient stories say

77
00:03:43,069 --> 00:03:51,930
especially after the stories of Cain and

78
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:56,129
Abel and Noah and the Tower of Babel

79
00:03:51,930 --> 00:04:00,439
when you get to the accounts of the

80
00:03:56,129 --> 00:04:04,919
historically or historically real people

81
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:07,859
one injunction seems to be get the hell

82
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:09,959
out there and do something you know one

83
00:04:07,859 --> 00:04:12,150
of the major themes for all of the

84
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:18,449
patriarchs that we've talked about

85
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:20,519
Abraham say Jacob and Joseph is move out

86
00:04:18,449 --> 00:04:24,270
into the world regardless of the

87
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:25,830
circumstances at hand now that's in in

88
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:29,010
in the Old Testament stories that's

89
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:30,900
basically portrayed as harkening to the

90
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:31,660
voice of God something like that maybe

91
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:33,930
you could think about

92
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:37,390
his destiny or a psychological calling

93
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:39,130
and the funny thing too is is that it's

94
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:42,760
not that these people have an easy time

95
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:45,310
of it when they heed that call so what's

96
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:47,620
what's fascinating is that they often

97
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:49,480
run into extreme difficulties right away

98
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:52,120
and I think that's very interesting

99
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:55,480
first of all because life is obviously

100
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:57,700
full of extreme difficulties and second

101
00:04:55,480 --> 00:05:00,070
it's another example of the failure to

102
00:04:57,700 --> 00:05:03,400
sugarcoat things which is one of the

103
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:04,810
things I think makes a mockery of anti

104
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,210
religious theories that are even quite

105
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:10,090
sophisticated say like Freud's because

106
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:12,190
Freud thought of religion as a and it

107
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:15,760
was a wish fulfillment essentially and

108
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:18,610
and also Marx who thought about religion

109
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:20,800
as the opiate of the masses it's if

110
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:23,350
those were true it seems to me that

111
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,630
there'd be a lot more wish and a lot

112
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:27,850
less reality a lot less stark harsh

113
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:32,070
reality you know in the first thing that

114
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:35,920
Abraham encounters is a famine and then

115
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:38,470
he has to hide his wife and then he he

116
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:40,540
basically journeys into a tyranny so

117
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:43,780
that's about as bad as it gets in some

118
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:45,400
ways and those themes recur continually

119
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:46,810
and no one ever lives where they're

120
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:49,210
supposed to live they'll even live in

121
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:51,430
Canaan and not the promised land and so

122
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:54,669
it's a pretty rough it's a pretty rough

123
00:05:51,430 --> 00:05:58,210
series of stories but the fundamental

124
00:05:54,669 --> 00:06:00,280
idea is something like there's no time

125
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:02,530
for sitting around there's time to go

126
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:05,260
out into the world and engage and then

127
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:07,570
there's there's hints about the proper

128
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:10,660
and improper ways of engaging right so

129
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:12,669
clearly the improper way to engage is I

130
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:16,919
think most clearly delineated in the

131
00:06:12,669 --> 00:06:19,780
Cain and Abel story and with Cain

132
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:21,760
exemplifying the inappropriate way to

133
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:25,390
engage with the world and that's to

134
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:28,870
engage with the world in a bitter

135
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:30,250
jealous and resentful manner now one of

136
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:31,960
the things that I really like about the

137
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:34,150
Cain and Abel story and that theme

138
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:35,860
recurs continually with the with the

139
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:38,610
duality of the brothers right there's

140
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:40,510
there's constant conflict between a

141
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:42,700
perspective that's essentially like

142
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:44,560
Cain's and and the and the opposite

143
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,620
perspective which all which I'll get to

144
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,300
in a minute

145
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:52,669
but Caine sees that the world is a very

146
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:55,040
tragic place and that the rewards are

147
00:06:52,669 --> 00:06:57,169
distributed unfairly and that there are

148
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:59,600
people who do better and people who do

149
00:06:57,169 --> 00:07:02,180
worse and as a consequence of that he

150
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:05,389
becomes bitter and resentful and curses

151
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:07,430
God and then he becomes homicidal

152
00:07:05,389 --> 00:07:09,290
fratricidal which is even worse than he

153
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:11,630
destroys his own ideal then his

154
00:07:09,290 --> 00:07:15,080
descendants basically become genocide or

155
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:17,660
something like that so that seems to be

156
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:19,639
the wrong way to go about things you

157
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:23,510
know unless your goal is to make things

158
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:26,120
worse like it's not like it has a

159
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:28,039
limited number of things has nothing to

160
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:30,560
object to he's got plenty to object to

161
00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:32,750
his situation actually is bad he's

162
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,639
overshadowed terribly by his brother who

163
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:37,330
everyone loves who does extraordinarily

164
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:40,430
well and who's good at everything and

165
00:07:37,330 --> 00:07:42,710
the story is a bit of nivel inton for

166
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:44,030
Keynes failure although a fair bit of

167
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:46,400
its laid at his own feet

168
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:48,350
but he's definitely failing and so you

169
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,180
can understand why he would have this

170
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:51,950
terrible attitude

171
00:07:50,180 --> 00:07:55,669
but the problem is all it does is make

172
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:56,930
it worse so it doesn't seem to be one of

173
00:07:55,669 --> 00:07:58,520
the things I've also learned as a

174
00:07:56,930 --> 00:08:00,500
psychologist sort of pondering these

175
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,660
sorts of things it's often a lot easier

176
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:04,700
to identify what you shouldn't do than

177
00:08:02,660 --> 00:08:07,010
what you should do like it's I think

178
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:10,460
evil is easier to identify than good I

179
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:12,169
think good is trickier but evil stands

180
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:13,610
out to some degree and then at least you

181
00:08:12,169 --> 00:08:15,620
can say if you're trying to get as far

182
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:17,479
away from that as possible we could even

183
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:19,430
say just for practical reasons so your

184
00:08:17,479 --> 00:08:21,169
life doesn't become hell and your family

185
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:22,820
life doesn't become hell at least you

186
00:08:21,169 --> 00:08:25,099
could get as far away from that as

187
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:28,160
possible even if you weren't able to

188
00:08:25,099 --> 00:08:29,979
conjure up what would constitute the

189
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:33,080
good as a name you could at least avoid

190
00:08:29,979 --> 00:08:34,729
those sorts of pitfalls and I do also

191
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:36,229
think that its pitfalls like that that

192
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:39,409
really threaten our society right now

193
00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:42,229
you know that I see a tremendous rise in

194
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:44,060
resentment fueling almost all of the

195
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:46,279
political polarization that's taking

196
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:48,680
place and seems unfortunate given that

197
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:50,390
by and by large everyone on the planet

198
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,580
is richer than they've ever been

199
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:54,020
now that doesn't mean there's no

200
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:57,980
disparity there's but there's always

201
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:58,950
disparity anyways Jacob of course Jacob

202
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:02,400
on

203
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:06,630
see so and so the and Jacob ends up with

204
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:10,710
with with Isaac's blessing and so that's

205
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:12,480
that's a moral catastrophe and then he

206
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:13,140
has to run because his brother wants to

207
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,560
kill him

208
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:18,270
and so that's the fratricidal motif

209
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,730
again I like that too I think that's

210
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:22,620
real really realistic you know one of

211
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:24,090
the things that Freud noted constantly

212
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:28,020
and this is where Freud really is a

213
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:30,240
genius is that the most intense hatreds

214
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:33,690
and also sometimes the most intense love

215
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:37,140
is within families you know and in the

216
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:41,310
Freudian world of psychopathology it's

217
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:43,890
all it's all inside the family and in

218
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:45,990
fact the pathology in the Freudian world

219
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:48,120
is actually the fact that it's all

220
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:49,980
inside the family because people who get

221
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,140
tangled up in the Freudian familial

222
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:55,080
nightmare which is roughly eatable in

223
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:56,550
structure can only conceptualize the

224
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,830
world in terms of their familial

225
00:09:56,550 --> 00:10:00,660
relationships they've been so damaged by

226
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:02,820
the enmeshment and the trauma and the

227
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:05,280
deceit and the betrayal and the blurred

228
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:08,190
lines and all of that that they just

229
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:11,940
can't expand past the family and go out

230
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:14,490
in the world so the idea that brothers

231
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:18,120
can be at each other's throats I think

232
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:19,530
is that's a very powerful idea and it's

233
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:22,860
not something that people like to think

234
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:25,170
about so so Jacob has to leave and it's

235
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:26,910
not surprising because I mean what he

236
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:28,740
did was pretty reprehensible he betrayed

237
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:30,750
his brother but nonetheless he's the

238
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:35,370
person who dreams of the ladder that

239
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:37,290
unites heaven and earth and that's a

240
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:38,730
very perverse thing you know what but

241
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:40,830
one of the things I think it does is

242
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:44,190
give in some sense it gives hope to

243
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:45,720
everyone because it isn't you know if

244
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:48,240
only the good guys win we're really in

245
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:50,640
trouble right because it's not that easy

246
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,290
to be a good guy it's it's it's really

247
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,630
not that easy and most people are pretty

248
00:10:52,290 --> 00:10:57,510
keenly aware of all the ways that they

249
00:10:54,630 --> 00:11:01,080
fall short even of their own ideals and

250
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:03,510
so if there was no hope except for the

251
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:06,900
good guys almost all of us would be lost

252
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:08,910
and so that's one of the things I really

253
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:10,530
liked and was more surprised about with

254
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:12,910
the Old Testament stories is that these

255
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:16,090
people are a very complex

256
00:11:12,910 --> 00:11:19,750
and they make very major moral errors by

257
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:22,300
anyone's standard and yet if and yet the

258
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:24,280
overall message is still hopeful and the

259
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:27,160
the message that runs contrary to the

260
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:29,860
message of evil say that message of good

261
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:33,760
is something like well there's a lot of

262
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:38,110
emphasis on faith right and the that's a

263
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:40,450
tough one because cynics people who are

264
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:43,900
cynical about religious structures like

265
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:45,880
to think of faith as the willingness to

266
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:50,680
demolish your intellect in the service

267
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:51,640
of superstition and well there's there's

268
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:55,930
something to be said for that

269
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:57,880
perspective but not a lot because the

270
00:11:55,930 --> 00:12:01,030
reality is much more sophisticated part

271
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:03,100
of the faith that's that that is being

272
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:05,020
insisted upon in the old testament is

273
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:08,440
something like and I'm speaking

274
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:11,440
psychologically here again that it's

275
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:13,930
useful to pause it a high high good and

276
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,610
to aim at it so and I really think

277
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:17,050
that's practically useful to the

278
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:18,760
research we've done with the Future

279
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:20,410
authoring program for example indicates

280
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:23,290
pretty clearly that if you get people to

281
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:25,390
conceptualize an ideal and a balanced

282
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:26,680
ideal you know so what do you want for

283
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:27,910
your family what do you want for your

284
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:29,470
career what do you want for your

285
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:31,030
education what do you want for your

286
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:35,410
character development how are you going

287
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:37,120
to use your time outside of work how are

288
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:38,650
you going to structure your use of drugs

289
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:40,600
and alcohol in places where you might

290
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:42,970
get impulsive how can you avoid falling

291
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:44,320
into a horrible pit if you really think

292
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:46,360
that through and you come up with an

293
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:48,130
integrated ideal and you you put it

294
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:52,750
above you as something to reach for

295
00:12:48,130 --> 00:12:55,170
then you're more committed to the world

296
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:58,050
in a positive way and you're less

297
00:12:55,170 --> 00:13:01,030
tormented by anxiety and uncertainty and

298
00:12:58,050 --> 00:13:04,260
so and that makes sense right because

299
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:06,790
here you are alive and everything and so

300
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:08,950
unless you were capable if you're not

301
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:10,840
capable of manifesting some positive

302
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:13,120
relationship with the fact of your being

303
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:16,120
then how could that be anything other

304
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:17,740
than hellish because you it would just

305
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:19,120
be anxiety provoking and terrible

306
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:21,640
because you're vulnerable and there'd be

307
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:24,280
nothing useful or worthwhile to do well

308
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:26,290
that's just not I just can't see that as

309
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:29,529
a winning strategy for anyone you can

310
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:32,079
make a rational case for adopting that

311
00:13:29,529 --> 00:13:34,060
strategy in that you know you can say

312
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:36,130
well there's no evidence for for a

313
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:37,870
transcendent morality or for an ultimate

314
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:41,470
meaning there's no hard empirical

315
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:43,899
evidence but it seems to me that there's

316
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:45,310
existential evidence as well that has to

317
00:13:43,899 --> 00:13:47,470
be taken into account

318
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:50,620
and of course psych psychologists have

319
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:52,480
talked about this a lot Carl Rogers for

320
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:53,740
example in Hume for that matter Freud

321
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,540
for that matter most of the great

322
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:58,240
psychologists have pointed out that you

323
00:13:55,540 --> 00:14:00,610
know you can derive reasonable

324
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,959
information that's that's solid from

325
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:03,279
your own experience especially if you

326
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:05,470
also talk to other people and you can

327
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:08,319
kind of see in your own life when you're

328
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:10,389
on a productive path that sort of in

329
00:14:08,319 --> 00:14:13,720
Nobles and enlightens you or a

330
00:14:10,389 --> 00:14:15,759
destructive path and I think it's kind

331
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:17,920
of useful to think that maybe the

332
00:14:15,759 --> 00:14:22,000
dichotomy between those two paths might

333
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:24,509
be real you know and and because that

334
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,610
also allows you to give credence to your

335
00:14:24,509 --> 00:14:29,110
intuitions about that sort of thing but

336
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:30,880
I don't anyways I don't think it's

337
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:34,240
unreasonable to posit that since you're

338
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:36,190
alive adopting the highest possible

339
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,079
regard for the fact that you're alive

340
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:40,269
and that you're surrounded by other

341
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:42,040
creatures that are alive I just can't

342
00:14:40,269 --> 00:14:44,620
see how that can possibly be construed

343
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:45,880
as a losing strategy and so that's the

344
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:48,430
first thing so that's something like

345
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:50,500
faith right it's faith it's not it's not

346
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:52,510
only faith in your being but it's faith

347
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:55,660
in being as such and the faith would be

348
00:14:52,510 --> 00:14:57,940
something like if you could orient your

349
00:14:55,660 --> 00:15:01,269
being properly then maybe that would

350
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:04,410
orient you with being as such and you

351
00:15:01,269 --> 00:15:06,579
never know like I mean it might be true

352
00:15:04,410 --> 00:15:08,889
there's no reason to assume that it

353
00:15:06,579 --> 00:15:10,959
wouldn't be true I mean even if you just

354
00:15:08,889 --> 00:15:12,670
take a strict biological perspective on

355
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:14,470
this and think about us as the product

356
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:17,860
of three and a half billion years of

357
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:20,199
evolution I mean we have struggled over

358
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:22,930
all those billions of years to be alive

359
00:15:20,199 --> 00:15:25,329
and to match ourselves with reality and

360
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:27,399
so because one of the things I've often

361
00:15:25,329 --> 00:15:29,170
wondered is you know life is definitely

362
00:15:27,399 --> 00:15:30,610
difficult there's no doubt about that

363
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:32,380
and that's unfair and there's inequality

364
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:34,209
and all of those things and people are

365
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:37,839
subject to all sorts of terrible things

366
00:15:34,209 --> 00:15:40,030
but I also wonder if you weren't

367
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:43,120
actively striving to make things

368
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:48,160
worse just how much better could they be

369
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:50,500
you know because people are very they

370
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,270
like houses that are divided amongst

371
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,950
themselves they're pointing in six

372
00:15:52,270 --> 00:15:56,260
different directions at the same time

373
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:57,820
they're working at cross-purposes to

374
00:15:56,260 --> 00:16:00,660
themselves because of bitterness or

375
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:03,340
began and resentment and on what

376
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:06,220
unprocessed memories and childhood

377
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:08,980
hatreds and unexamined assumptions all

378
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:11,470
sorts of things and you you just gotta

379
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:13,510
wonder if you could push that aside and

380
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:16,060
or int yourself properly and then the

381
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:17,860
other thing that of course is stressed

382
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:19,560
very heavily in the Old Testament and of

383
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:23,530
course that goes through the entire

384
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:25,150
biblical corpus is that it's not only

385
00:16:23,530 --> 00:16:26,950
enough to establish a positive

386
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:29,500
relationship with being which I think is

387
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:31,900
the essential it's a good description of

388
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:33,970
faith you have to make that decision

389
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:36,730
right because being is very ambivalent

390
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:37,870
and you can make the case that maybe

391
00:16:36,730 --> 00:16:38,620
it's something that should have never

392
00:16:37,870 --> 00:16:40,870
happened

393
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:43,240
but that doesn't seem to be productive

394
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:45,790
to me and faith seems to be I'm going to

395
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:48,160
act as if being is ultimately

396
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:50,320
justifiable and that if I partake in it

397
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,840
properly I will improve it rather than

398
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:55,000
making it worse so I think that's the

399
00:16:52,840 --> 00:16:57,480
statement of faith and then what seems

400
00:16:55,000 --> 00:17:01,540
to go along with that is something like

401
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:04,450
truth in conception and action you know

402
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:06,460
even people like Jacob who are pretty

403
00:17:04,450 --> 00:17:08,920
damn morally ambivalent to begin with

404
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:10,960
get hammered a lot by what they go

405
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:12,430
through and what seems to happen is that

406
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:15,280
they're hammered into some sort of

407
00:17:12,430 --> 00:17:17,620
ethical shape right so by the mid point

408
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,990
of their life's journey there are people

409
00:17:17,620 --> 00:17:23,310
who are solidly planted who you can

410
00:17:19,990 --> 00:17:25,810
trust and who don't betray being or

411
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:30,130
themselves or their fellow man and so

412
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:33,580
it's an interesting I mean it seems

413
00:17:30,130 --> 00:17:35,920
reasonable to me to first assume that

414
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:37,600
you have to establish a relationship

415
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:39,610
with something that's transcendent it

416
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:43,480
might even be just the future version of

417
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:45,280
you but and then second that you have to

418
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:47,050
align yourself with reality in a

419
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,830
truthful manner and that that's your

420
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:50,130
best bet

421
00:17:47,830 --> 00:17:50,130
and

422
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:55,790
the biblical stories are actually quite

423
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:58,130
realistic about that too because they

424
00:17:55,790 --> 00:18:00,440
don't really say that if you do that

425
00:17:58,130 --> 00:18:01,460
you're going to be instantly transported

426
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:03,140
to the promised land

427
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:05,120
like even Moses as we'll find out in the

428
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:07,910
Exodus stories he never makes it to the

429
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:11,210
Promised Land and so it's not like

430
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:13,700
you're offered instantaneous final

431
00:18:11,210 --> 00:18:16,910
Redemption if you move out forthrightly

432
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:19,880
into the world establish a faithful

433
00:18:16,910 --> 00:18:22,520
relationship with being an attempt to

434
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:24,740
conduct yourself with integrity but it's

435
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:26,780
your best bet and it might be good

436
00:18:24,740 --> 00:18:29,270
enough and even if it's not good enough

437
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:31,220
it's really preferable to the

438
00:18:29,270 --> 00:18:34,250
alternative which seems to be something

439
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:41,540
closely akin to hell both personal and

440
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:44,450
social so Joseph's father is Jacob later

441
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:46,250
Israel he who wrestles with God and

442
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:48,380
we've talked about that a little bit

443
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:50,360
it's sort of implicit and what I've been

444
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:53,750
saying is that I think we all do that to

445
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:56,390
some degree we wrestle with reality

446
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:58,370
itself that's for sure not only the

447
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:59,780
reality we understand but the reality we

448
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:01,540
don't understand which is sort of a

449
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:04,040
transcendent reality and then maybe

450
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:05,870
whatever reality is outside of that you

451
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:07,730
know because the classic judeo-christian

452
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:10,190
conception of God is that there's time

453
00:19:07,730 --> 00:19:12,830
and space and of course there's lots of

454
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:14,480
things about what exists in time and

455
00:19:12,830 --> 00:19:16,280
space that we're completely ignorant of

456
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,020
and that's transcendent in that sense

457
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:21,080
but then there's an idea that there's a

458
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:22,460
realm outside of that which is a well

459
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:24,530
it's an interesting idea it's a very

460
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:28,010
sophisticated idea I think rather than a

461
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:30,530
simple idea it's it's difficult to know

462
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:33,410
what to make of it but it doesn't really

463
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:36,110
matter because I think regardless of

464
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:38,600
what your attitude is towards those

465
00:19:36,110 --> 00:19:41,960
sorts of things intellectually you still

466
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:43,700
end up in the same position as Jacob for

467
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:45,200
all intents and purposes practically

468
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:47,420
speaking because I don't think that

469
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:49,070
there's anyone who at some point in

470
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:51,740
their life or perhaps even everyday

471
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:53,900
doesn't at some level wrestle with God

472
00:19:51,740 --> 00:19:56,150
and you could just call it well the

473
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:58,880
nature of reality I suppose if you want

474
00:19:56,150 --> 00:20:00,350
to be say reductionistic about it but I

475
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:02,540
don't think it makes any difference it's

476
00:20:00,350 --> 00:20:05,360
still something you're stuck with and

477
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:06,260
it's not only the nature of reality

478
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,790
itself that you

479
00:20:06,260 --> 00:20:09,560
have to struggle with but it's also the

480
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:11,150
nature of your moral relationship to it

481
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:13,040
your behavioral relationship to it so

482
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:15,620
that's how you should perceive it and

483
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:18,380
how you should conduct yourself and then

484
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:20,510
whether or not the the advantages of

485
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:23,030
doing it properly are worth the

486
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:24,860
difficulty and the disadvantages so that

487
00:20:23,030 --> 00:20:27,230
seems to me just a straight existential

488
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:29,780
statement then you know Jacob gets

489
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:34,520
damaged by his wrestling which is also

490
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:36,050
very realistic so anyways he also ends

491
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:38,750
up his father of Joseph who's the

492
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:41,360
favorite son son who's born in his old

493
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:42,980
age to his favorite wife and that's who

494
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:47,810
we're gonna talk about to you today so

495
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:49,460
you remember so Jacob is the forefather

496
00:20:47,810 --> 00:20:53,690
of the twelve tribes of Israel and

497
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:56,390
there's his his wives and this son and

498
00:20:53,690 --> 00:20:58,040
the offspring that resulted those are

499
00:20:56,390 --> 00:21:00,800
all the sons there's a daughter named

500
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:03,110
Dinah as well and rachel is the woman he

501
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:05,090
really loved and the first son he had

502
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:07,070
with Rachel was Joseph and that was when

503
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:12,560
he was older and so that's in some sense

504
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:15,110
why Joseph is his favorite so this is

505
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:17,420
the beginning of the story of Joseph now

506
00:21:15,110 --> 00:21:18,980
Israel Jacob loved Joseph more than all

507
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:20,420
his children because he was the son of

508
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:23,270
his old age and he made him a coat of

509
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:26,000
many colors and there's a lot packed

510
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:28,340
into those two sentences you know the

511
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:31,280
first is that now Israel loved Joseph

512
00:21:28,340 --> 00:21:33,290
more than all his other children that's

513
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:35,090
probably not so good one of the things

514
00:21:33,290 --> 00:21:37,250
we've seen in the stories that have

515
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:39,890
preceded this is that whenever there's

516
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:42,800
marked preference on the part of parents

517
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:46,220
for one child over the other and in with

518
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:50,120
with with with Jacob and Esau it was

519
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:56,460
Rachel was Jacob was Rachel's favorite

520
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:58,620
and ISA was Isaac's fav

521
00:21:56,460 --> 00:22:00,390
that didn't work out so well that put a

522
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:02,250
real twist in the entire structure of

523
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:05,190
the family and so there's a warning

524
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:06,750
there right off the bat you might say

525
00:22:05,190 --> 00:22:09,090
well you can't help having a preference

526
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:10,500
for one child or for another but I don't

527
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:11,610
know if that's true and it's certainly

528
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,140
something that you should be very

529
00:22:11,610 --> 00:22:15,150
cautious about because it doesn't seem

530
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:17,460
to work out very well because he was the

531
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:20,280
son of his old age fair enough and he

532
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:22,110
made him a coat of many colors that's a

533
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:25,440
very interesting image that coat of many

534
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:27,750
colors that that idea and so I'm gonna

535
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,880
delve into that idea because it sets the

536
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:32,670
stage like it says what sort of person

537
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:34,830
Joseph is he's favored he's younger he's

538
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:37,500
favored but he also has this particular

539
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:39,120
garment that characterizes him you know

540
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:41,430
and one of the things I've really

541
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:43,950
learned from analyzing women's dreams in

542
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:45,870
particular is that women very frequently

543
00:22:43,950 --> 00:22:48,660
in my experience very frequently dream

544
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:50,850
of clothing as a role and so if you're

545
00:22:48,660 --> 00:22:52,890
interpreting women's dreams then if they

546
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:55,650
put on the shoes of their grandmother

547
00:22:52,890 --> 00:22:58,260
for example then you understand very

548
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:59,670
rapidly that the dream is trying to make

549
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,750
an association between their own

550
00:22:59,670 --> 00:23:03,240
behavior and something that's

551
00:23:00,750 --> 00:23:04,680
characteristic of either the state of

552
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:07,020
being a grandmother or the particular

553
00:23:04,680 --> 00:23:09,630
grandmother and it makes sense right

554
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:13,920
because clothing protects but it also

555
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:16,050
signifies a role and it's interesting in

556
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:17,760
in the Old Testament stories often if

557
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:20,370
someone is going to act deceitfully they

558
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:21,720
change their they change their outfit

559
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:24,120
and that's kind of what you do when you

560
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:26,100
act deceitfully right you dress up like

561
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:29,820
someone else you present yourself like

562
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:35,820
someone else so anyways back to the coat

563
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:39,390
of many colors well for something to be

564
00:23:35,820 --> 00:23:41,820
many colored it sort of spans the entire

565
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:43,700
gamut of possibility and so there's a

566
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:49,190
hint there that if you want to be a

567
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:52,020
full-fledged person that you have to

568
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:54,900
manifest a very large number of traits

569
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:56,430
and so I want to go into that idea a bit

570
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:58,260
the first thing I want to talk about is

571
00:23:56,430 --> 00:24:00,480
some of the things that we've learned

572
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:03,300
about what happens to you when you go to

573
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:06,570
a new environment now there's this idea

574
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:09,240
in very deep idea in clinical psychology

575
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:09,870
a fundamental idea which is that if

576
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,550
someone's a

577
00:24:09,870 --> 00:24:15,180
just about something what you do is you

578
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:16,380
and it's getting in their way you take

579
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:18,510
what they're anxious about and you

580
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:19,890
define it because that already delimits

581
00:24:18,510 --> 00:24:21,240
it right because one of the problems

582
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:22,530
with being anxious about something is

583
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:24,420
you won't speak of it

584
00:24:22,530 --> 00:24:26,340
it's like Voldemort and then if you

585
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:27,900
don't speak of it you it's way bigger

586
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:29,430
than it should be as soon as you start

587
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:32,309
talking about it you cut it down to size

588
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:33,390
and so and it it's for a bunch of

589
00:24:32,309 --> 00:24:35,370
reasons it's because you're not as

590
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:37,920
afraid you're not as afraid of as many

591
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:40,770
things as you think and you're braver

592
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:42,570
than you know and more and more capable

593
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:44,010
so as soon as you're brave enough to

594
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:45,900
start talking about what you're afraid

595
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:47,250
of then you see that there's more to you

596
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:50,130
than you thought and that there's less

597
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:51,600
to the problem than you thought and then

598
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:53,370
you can decompose it further into

599
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,720
smaller problems and then you can figure

600
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:57,390
out how to approach those smaller

601
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:59,730
problems and so and then it doesn't seem

602
00:24:57,390 --> 00:25:01,050
to me to be that you get less frightened

603
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:02,790
it seems to be that you get more

604
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:04,110
courageous which is way better than

605
00:25:02,790 --> 00:25:05,610
being less frightened because there's

606
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:07,380
lots of things to be frightened about so

607
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:09,570
if you're courageous that that really

608
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:12,120
does the trick now the question is what

609
00:25:09,570 --> 00:25:15,480
happens if you like let's say that

610
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:17,010
you're very socially inept and you don't

611
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:19,620
know how to introduce yourself or to

612
00:25:17,010 --> 00:25:21,600
make any establish the initial parts of

613
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:23,370
a relationship with anyone and so then

614
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:26,309
you start putting yourself in situations

615
00:25:23,370 --> 00:25:28,170
where you're required to do that and so

616
00:25:26,309 --> 00:25:31,290
then the question is how is it

617
00:25:28,170 --> 00:25:33,510
technically that you transform you say

618
00:25:31,290 --> 00:25:35,190
well you learn well we want to be more

619
00:25:33,510 --> 00:25:37,260
specific about that what does it mean

620
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:39,000
that you learned well if you're dealing

621
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:41,160
with someone who's particularly socially

622
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,480
inept and you're doing psychotherapy

623
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:44,820
with them you might teach them how to

624
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:46,290
shake someone's hand properly and say

625
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:48,390
their name and remember the other

626
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:49,830
person's name and so you just practice

627
00:25:48,390 --> 00:25:53,070
that with them so that they have the

628
00:25:49,830 --> 00:25:54,630
motoric routine down so that form of

629
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:56,760
knowledge is built right into your body

630
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:59,670
it's like look at the person put out

631
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:02,309
your hand shake it don't not like a dead

632
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:05,190
halibut but you know with a reasonable

633
00:26:02,309 --> 00:26:06,780
grip say your name don't mumble it look

634
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:08,580
look at them so that they can hear you

635
00:26:06,780 --> 00:26:11,130
and then when they say their name try to

636
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:12,750
remember it and that's then so you can

637
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:14,670
practice that with people and so then

638
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:16,200
they develop something that's motoric

639
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:19,770
right it's embedded right in their body

640
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:21,150
and so and then you can say to them well

641
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:23,090
the other thing you can do is when you

642
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:24,679
start a conversation is

643
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:26,960
don't sit there thinking about what

644
00:26:24,679 --> 00:26:28,490
you're gonna say next because then you

645
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,720
won't be paying attention to the person

646
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:34,039
and you'll make a fool out of yourself

647
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:35,870
because you'll manifest non sequiturs

648
00:26:34,039 --> 00:26:37,399
right because you'll get out it's like

649
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:39,379
if you're dancing and all you're paying

650
00:26:37,399 --> 00:26:40,999
attention to is where your feet are and

651
00:26:39,379 --> 00:26:41,990
you're gonna step on the other person

652
00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:43,970
all the time so you want to pay

653
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:46,639
attention to the other person and then

654
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:48,649
whatever automatized social knowledge

655
00:26:46,639 --> 00:26:49,909
you have will come to the forefront so

656
00:26:48,649 --> 00:26:51,620
it's a good thing to know if you're

657
00:26:49,909 --> 00:26:53,120
socially anxious right if you're

658
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:55,399
socially anxious one of the things you

659
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:57,590
should do is pay way more attention to

660
00:26:55,399 --> 00:26:59,240
the person you're talking to rather than

661
00:26:57,590 --> 00:27:01,730
less and you should pay as little

662
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:03,409
attention as possible to yourself so if

663
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:05,119
you feel yourself falling in because

664
00:27:03,409 --> 00:27:06,649
you're anxious then what you do is you

665
00:27:05,119 --> 00:27:08,240
push your attention out and pay

666
00:27:06,649 --> 00:27:09,860
attention to the person because to the

667
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,779
degree that you've been socialized then

668
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:14,330
all your automatic responses will kick

669
00:27:11,779 --> 00:27:16,279
in so but anyway so you go out into the

670
00:27:14,330 --> 00:27:17,600
social world and you learn to shake

671
00:27:16,279 --> 00:27:19,879
someone's hand and you learn how to

672
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,769
listen to them and ask them questions

673
00:27:19,879 --> 00:27:23,899
because that's the next thing because

674
00:27:21,769 --> 00:27:26,179
people love you can't just ask them

675
00:27:23,899 --> 00:27:27,799
random questions obviously but if they

676
00:27:26,179 --> 00:27:29,659
start talking to you and you don't

677
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:31,249
understand something about what they're

678
00:27:29,659 --> 00:27:32,600
saying or maybe something they said is

679
00:27:31,249 --> 00:27:34,580
interesting and you ask them a question

680
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,929
they're pretty damn happy about that

681
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:37,549
because it means you're actually paying

682
00:27:35,929 --> 00:27:39,980
attention to them and people actually

683
00:27:37,549 --> 00:27:42,409
love to be paid attention to because it

684
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:45,230
hardly ever happens so they really

685
00:27:42,409 --> 00:27:47,299
really like it and so okay so so what's

686
00:27:45,230 --> 00:27:50,600
happening well first of all your

687
00:27:47,299 --> 00:27:52,850
mastering them automated motor movements

688
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:54,710
right where to point your eyes where to

689
00:27:52,850 --> 00:27:56,960
put your hands how to move your lips

690
00:27:54,710 --> 00:27:59,059
like really embodied knowledge it's a

691
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:01,340
special kind of memory and you're

692
00:27:59,059 --> 00:28:04,759
practicing them so that's building new

693
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:06,049
skills for you and then by listening to

694
00:28:04,759 --> 00:28:10,309
the person and watching yourself

695
00:28:06,049 --> 00:28:12,409
interact you're also generating new new

696
00:28:10,309 --> 00:28:13,999
abstract information that enables you to

697
00:28:12,409 --> 00:28:16,789
conceptualize the world in a different

698
00:28:13,999 --> 00:28:19,129
way so if you go out to ten you go out

699
00:28:16,789 --> 00:28:21,619
and talk to ten different people or 50

700
00:28:19,129 --> 00:28:23,570
different people then you get to listen

701
00:28:21,619 --> 00:28:25,669
to what those 50 people said you get to

702
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:28,249
watch how they're how they express

703
00:28:25,669 --> 00:28:29,600
themselves and you gather a corpus of

704
00:28:28,249 --> 00:28:31,909
knowledge that changes the way you

705
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:34,250
perceive that broadens you as a social

706
00:28:31,909 --> 00:28:35,720
agent okay so that's two forms of

707
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:36,330
knowledge but then there's a third one

708
00:28:35,720 --> 00:28:38,670
which is real

709
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:41,640
interesting which is that you know you

710
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:43,740
have a lot of biological potential and

711
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:46,050
it's hard to know what potential is but

712
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:49,140
part of it is that you're capable of

713
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:50,730
generating proteins that you haven't

714
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:53,490
been generating so you should get right

715
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:55,200
on that by the way so but what the way

716
00:28:53,490 --> 00:28:57,030
that works in part is that if you put

717
00:28:55,200 --> 00:29:00,600
yourself in a radically new situation

718
00:28:57,030 --> 00:29:02,940
then your brain that there are genetic

719
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:05,190
switches that turn on because of the

720
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:08,810
demands of the new situation that code

721
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:11,400
for new proteins so it's as if you have

722
00:29:08,810 --> 00:29:13,500
latent software that would be one way of

723
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:15,630
thinking about that will only be turned

724
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:17,760
on if you go into the situation where

725
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:20,190
that's necessary and so then you might

726
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:22,080
think well if that's the case how much

727
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:23,670
of you could be turned on if you went a

728
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:26,040
whole bunch of different places and

729
00:29:23,670 --> 00:29:29,490
that's a really really that's a profound

730
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:32,070
question because one of the deep answers

731
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:35,250
to how you should get your life together

732
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:40,020
is you should go a very large number of

733
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:41,190
places and turn yourself on and I want

734
00:29:40,020 --> 00:29:43,620
to walk through that a little bit

735
00:29:41,190 --> 00:29:48,150
because there's a very rich symbolic

736
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:50,820
world that expresses that so now the

737
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:54,660
idea about having a coat of many colors

738
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:57,210
would be that the person who is the

739
00:29:54,660 --> 00:29:58,890
appropriate leader because remember or

740
00:29:57,210 --> 00:30:00,840
the proper person which would be the

741
00:29:58,890 --> 00:30:03,810
same thing one of the things that these

742
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:05,730
old stories are trying to express and to

743
00:30:03,810 --> 00:30:07,980
figure out is how is it that you should

744
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:10,490
act which is the same as what

745
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:13,260
constitutes the ideal those are the same

746
00:30:10,490 --> 00:30:15,060
question and the hand here with Joseph

747
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:16,620
is well you should wear a coat of many

748
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:18,960
colors which means that you should be

749
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:21,450
able to go have a drink in the pub with

750
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:23,760
the guys who are you know drywalling

751
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:25,080
your your house and you should be able

752
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:28,080
to have a sophisticated conversation

753
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:29,760
with someone who's more educated in an

754
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:30,960
abstract way and that maybe you should

755
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:33,120
be equally comfortable in both

756
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:36,690
situations right because you might think

757
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:38,550
well there's more one of the indications

758
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:42,480
that there's more to you is that you can

759
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:44,070
be put more places and function properly

760
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:47,280
and that would be a good thing to aim at

761
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:50,160
because here's the other issue is that

762
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:52,860
you know perfectly well that the fun

763
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:54,870
the mental tragedies of life and your

764
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:56,280
exposure to malevolence in the course of

765
00:30:54,870 --> 00:30:58,860
that life so those being the worst

766
00:30:56,280 --> 00:31:01,440
things there's not a lot you can do to

767
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:03,480
to alter that fundamentally because

768
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:05,220
their conditions of existence you're

769
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:06,660
going to be subject to your

770
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:09,420
vulnerability and you're going to be

771
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:11,340
subject to malevolence that's that and

772
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:13,410
you can't hide from it because it

773
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:15,630
actually makes it worse so you're stuck

774
00:31:13,410 --> 00:31:17,250
with it so then the question is well

775
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:19,260
what are your options and one option is

776
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:21,510
to curse the structure of being for

777
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:23,370
being malevolent and tragic and fair

778
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:27,470
enough and now there is to make yourself

779
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:31,770
so damn differentiated and dynamic and

780
00:31:27,470 --> 00:31:34,230
able that you're more than a match for

781
00:31:31,770 --> 00:31:36,480
that now that's not an easy thing but

782
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:37,260
doesn't matter because like what what's

783
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,450
the alternative

784
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:45,750
there's no good alternative and that's

785
00:31:39,450 --> 00:31:47,520
also worth knowing so you see these

786
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:50,430
ideas expressed in the strangest places

787
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:53,220
and so we've talked a little bit I think

788
00:31:50,430 --> 00:31:55,400
in this video series about Pinocchio but

789
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:58,200
if we haven't it doesn't matter

790
00:31:55,400 --> 00:32:03,000
you see there's Jiminy Cricket at the

791
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:05,160
opening of the Pinocchio movie pointing

792
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,900
to a star which is roughly the nativity

793
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:10,940
star for all intents and purposes and

794
00:32:06,900 --> 00:32:14,520
it's a it's a symbolic indicator of

795
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:17,040
something Dimond like and pure right

796
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:19,620
glimmering in the darkness that's

797
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:22,560
transcendent and above the horizon upon

798
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:24,300
which to fix your eyes and so that's the

799
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:27,660
thing is you need that technically and

800
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:29,520
the reason you need that is because we

801
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:31,290
know enough about psychology now to know

802
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:32,580
that almost all of the positive emotion

803
00:32:31,290 --> 00:32:35,040
that you're going to experience in your

804
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:36,960
life and positive emotion is analgesic

805
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:38,790
by the way right it actually quells pain

806
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,850
so it's not just positive it also gets

807
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:42,990
rid of negative which is a big plus

808
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:44,760
almost all the positive emotion that

809
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:47,430
you're going to feel you're going to

810
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:49,560
feel in relationship to a goal because

811
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:51,900
you feel positive emotion as you

812
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:53,520
approach a goal and so if you want to

813
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:55,230
feel positive emotion then you need a

814
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:57,060
goal and then you might think well if

815
00:32:55,230 --> 00:32:59,310
you want to maximize that positive

816
00:32:57,060 --> 00:33:00,960
emotion which is enthusiasm and also

817
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:03,720
what pulls you out into the world as

818
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:06,900
well as feeling good then you need the

819
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:11,880
possible goal well not because that's

820
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:13,470
gonna engage the largest segments of

821
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:15,059
your being like if your goal is too

822
00:33:13,470 --> 00:33:17,280
narrow then a bunch of you isn't gonna

823
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:19,830
be on board for it you know if the goal

824
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:21,780
is well-developed and multifaceted then

825
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:23,429
all of you can partake in that even your

826
00:33:21,780 --> 00:33:25,950
negative elements even your anger and

827
00:33:23,429 --> 00:33:28,409
and your fear can get on board with that

828
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:30,900
let's say so you need a goal man that's

829
00:33:28,409 --> 00:33:32,760
worthy you've got us thank you good you

830
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:35,280
need a goal that justifies the tragedy

831
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:37,830
and malevolence of life that seems to be

832
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:39,299
the bottom line now maybe you think well

833
00:33:37,830 --> 00:33:44,820
there's no goal that can do that it's

834
00:33:39,299 --> 00:33:47,850
like well there are still better and

835
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:49,620
worse goals so and I'm not convinced

836
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:52,620
that there are no goals that can do that

837
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:54,570
I think that's an open question you'd

838
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:56,730
never know that until you pursued the

839
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:59,400
proper goal long enough to find out who

840
00:33:56,730 --> 00:34:01,710
you would be as a consequence of

841
00:33:59,400 --> 00:34:03,570
pursuing it so that's also your destiny

842
00:34:01,710 --> 00:34:05,159
or your existential voyage right it's

843
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:07,860
also not something that anyone else can

844
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:09,839
do for you someone can say get your act

845
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:12,899
together for Christ's sake and get it

846
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:15,659
get get at it that's that'll make the

847
00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:17,990
world unfold best for you but there's no

848
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:22,050
way you can know that without doing it

849
00:34:17,990 --> 00:34:24,149
so and unless you think you've done a

850
00:34:22,050 --> 00:34:26,520
particularly stellar job of that then

851
00:34:24,149 --> 00:34:30,720
you have no reason to doubt its

852
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:33,750
potential validity so plus like crickets

853
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:36,570
are telling you this and so you know

854
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:39,060
they're a very reliable source okay so

855
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:41,609
you see the star the star recurs as a

856
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:43,530
motif in Pinocchio and one of the more

857
00:34:41,609 --> 00:34:46,020
interesting elements of it here is that

858
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:48,510
when Geppetto wants to transform his

859
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:51,599
puppet the marionette who's being played

860
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:53,790
by forces that operate behind the scenes

861
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:55,980
which is a really good definition of the

862
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:58,140
persona from a union perspective right

863
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:59,790
and also something indicative of

864
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:03,060
something like an ideological or

865
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:06,480
conceptual possession Geppetto who's a

866
00:35:03,060 --> 00:35:08,880
good guy is positive father figure Reid

867
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:11,010
lifts his even though he's a patriarchal

868
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,480
figure right and a very competent one he

869
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:14,820
still even lifts his eyes up to

870
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:17,369
something that transcends his mode of

871
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:17,760
being positive as it is and wishes that

872
00:35:17,369 --> 00:35:21,600
his

873
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:23,130
creation would undertake the kind of

874
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:26,070
transformation that would make it

875
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:28,680
autonomous and fully functional as a

876
00:35:26,070 --> 00:35:31,680
moral agent no strings right so that's

877
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:33,840
very interesting I think Solzhenitsyn

878
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:36,890
said the salvation of mankind lies only

879
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:40,410
in making everything the concern of all

880
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:43,859
that's a pretty decent star-like goal I

881
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:46,050
would say and so what happens in the

882
00:35:43,859 --> 00:35:48,359
Pinocchio story is that because and I

883
00:35:46,050 --> 00:35:49,890
think this is a symbolic representative

884
00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:51,690
of what I just described you that

885
00:35:49,890 --> 00:35:55,290
happens at a genetic level if you put

886
00:35:51,690 --> 00:35:57,240
yourself in new situations so Geppetto

887
00:35:55,290 --> 00:36:00,000
is roughly culture in the Pinocchio

888
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:03,690
story right he's he's a craftsman he's

889
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:07,920
he's a and and he makes Pinocchio so

890
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:12,510
he's he's who's his son he's the

891
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:15,359
socializing agent and he aims for

892
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:16,740
something above mere socialization which

893
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:18,359
is I think part of the mysterious

894
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:20,240
element of human beings you know in our

895
00:36:18,359 --> 00:36:22,859
scientific models we basically have

896
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:24,180
socialization and biology but there's

897
00:36:22,859 --> 00:36:26,970
always a third element in mythological

898
00:36:24,180 --> 00:36:29,490
stories which is whatever you might

899
00:36:26,970 --> 00:36:31,470
construe as the spontaneous action of

900
00:36:29,490 --> 00:36:33,540
consciousness that's associated with

901
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:35,250
freewill and you know that's just

902
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:36,900
basically being conceptualized in

903
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:39,090
religious terms as something akin to the

904
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:41,790
soul now we don't have a category for

905
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:43,109
that scientifically because what we try

906
00:36:41,790 --> 00:36:45,510
to do scientifically is to reduce

907
00:36:43,109 --> 00:36:48,869
everything either to socialization or to

908
00:36:45,510 --> 00:36:51,540
biology but it isn't clear to me that

909
00:36:48,869 --> 00:36:53,460
that's it's perfectly reasonable from

910
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:55,350
the perspective of practicality at a

911
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:57,480
scientific level you don't want to

912
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:59,340
multiply explanatory principles beyond

913
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:01,200
necessity but there's many things that

914
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:03,030
that doesn't come to terms with such as

915
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:05,490
the fact that we all treat each other as

916
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:07,170
autonomous beings with freewill and that

917
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:08,760
that seems to work and that if we stop

918
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:11,730
doing that then things go to hell very

919
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:13,770
very rapidly so and the mere fact that

920
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:16,460
we have been able to conceptualize what

921
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:18,270
that conscious freewill might be

922
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:20,040
metaphysically or physically doesn't

923
00:37:18,270 --> 00:37:22,859
mean it doesn't exist it just means that

924
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:24,510
we don't understand it I mean what it

925
00:37:22,859 --> 00:37:26,340
was only in the last 15 years that we

926
00:37:24,510 --> 00:37:27,930
discovered that 95 percent of the

927
00:37:26,340 --> 00:37:30,270
universe was made out of some kind of

928
00:37:27,930 --> 00:37:32,330
matter that we can't even

929
00:37:30,270 --> 00:37:36,260
whose properties we can't even imagine

930
00:37:32,330 --> 00:37:38,550
except that it seems to have mass so

931
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:42,480
anyways what happens is when Geppetto

932
00:37:38,550 --> 00:37:45,540
reach lifts his eyes up to the star he

933
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:48,030
so it's society aligning itself with the

934
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:51,390
proper goal with regards to individual

935
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:52,860
development right so so the instead of

936
00:37:51,390 --> 00:37:54,780
society being at odds with the

937
00:37:52,860 --> 00:37:56,790
individual they line up and then what

938
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:58,619
happens is nature comes onboard and

939
00:37:56,790 --> 00:38:00,630
that's the blue fairy in the in the

940
00:37:58,619 --> 00:38:02,460
Pinocchio story and that seems to me to

941
00:38:00,630 --> 00:38:05,820
be a symbolic representation of what

942
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:08,190
happens biologically when when you set

943
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:09,600
the goal properly get your culture

944
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:12,840
behind you and move into the world it's

945
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:14,250
that there's a biological transformation

946
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,750
that occurs as a consequence of that

947
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:19,470
which means that a bunch of you that

948
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:21,600
hasn't been turned on turns on and I

949
00:38:19,470 --> 00:38:23,100
guess one question would be is what

950
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:24,810
would you be like if you turned on

951
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:27,750
everything inside of you that could be

952
00:38:24,810 --> 00:38:33,330
turned on well that's a good goal that's

953
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:34,380
a good thing to find out so now I'm

954
00:38:33,330 --> 00:38:37,830
going to introduce a couple of other

955
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:39,869
ideas so there's this idea in union

956
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:42,750
psychology called the circumambulation

957
00:38:39,869 --> 00:38:45,060
and you only had this idea that you had

958
00:38:42,750 --> 00:38:47,700
a potential future self which would be

959
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:50,580
in potential everything that you could

960
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:53,700
be and that it manifests itself moment

961
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:56,100
to moment in your present life by making

962
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:57,840
you interested in things and the things

963
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:59,730
that you're interested in are the things

964
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:01,440
that would guide you along the path that

965
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:04,320
would lead you to maximal development

966
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:07,770
now it sounds of like a metaphysical

967
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:10,680
idea or a or a mystical idea even but

968
00:39:07,770 --> 00:39:12,780
but it's not it's it's not it's a really

969
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:15,450
profoundly biological idea the idea is

970
00:39:12,780 --> 00:39:16,950
something like well you're set up so

971
00:39:15,450 --> 00:39:19,560
that you're automatically interested in

972
00:39:16,950 --> 00:39:22,220
those things that was fully expand you

973
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:24,480
as a well adapted creature well like

974
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:27,270
there's nothing radical about that idea

975
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:28,770
how else what else could possibly be the

976
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:31,470
case unless there's something

977
00:39:28,770 --> 00:39:33,690
fundamentally flawed about you that is

978
00:39:31,470 --> 00:39:35,070
what the the situation would be it's

979
00:39:33,690 --> 00:39:36,990
kind of interesting to think about how

980
00:39:35,070 --> 00:39:39,450
that would be manifest moment to moment

981
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:40,980
but the idea is something like well your

982
00:39:39,450 --> 00:39:43,050
interest is captured by those things

983
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:44,130
that lead you down the path of

984
00:39:43,050 --> 00:39:46,200
development

985
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:48,240
well that better be the case okay so

986
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:50,100
that's fine and so there's some utility

987
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:51,570
in pursuing those things that you're

988
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:54,930
interested in that's the call to

989
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:56,520
adventure let's say so and the call to

990
00:39:54,930 --> 00:39:57,870
adventure takes you all sorts of places

991
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:59,340
now the problem with the call to

992
00:39:57,870 --> 00:40:01,710
adventure is like what the hell do you

993
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:03,950
know you might be interested in things

994
00:40:01,710 --> 00:40:07,260
that are kind of warped and bent and

995
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:09,870
often it's the case that when new parts

996
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:12,360
of people manifest themselves and grip

997
00:40:09,870 --> 00:40:15,360
their interest say they do it very badly

998
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:16,590
and shoddily and so you stumble around

999
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:18,510
like an idiot when you try to do

1000
00:40:16,590 --> 00:40:20,160
something new that's where the fool is

1001
00:40:18,510 --> 00:40:22,500
the precursor to the savior from the

1002
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:24,270
from the symbolic perspectives because

1003
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:25,770
you have to be a fool before you can be

1004
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:29,280
a master and if you're not willing to be

1005
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:31,830
a fool then you can't be a master so so

1006
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:33,960
you're gonna it's it's an error mmm

1007
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:35,400
error ridden process and that's also

1008
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,930
laid out in the Old Testament stories

1009
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:39,390
because the first thing that happens to

1010
00:40:36,930 --> 00:40:40,950
all these patriarchal figures when God

1011
00:40:39,390 --> 00:40:44,280
kicks them out of their father's house

1012
00:40:40,950 --> 00:40:46,380
when they're like 84 is that they they

1013
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:48,000
run into all sorts of trouble and some

1014
00:40:46,380 --> 00:40:49,350
of its social and some of its natural

1015
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:52,050
and some of it's a consequence of their

1016
00:40:49,350 --> 00:40:54,750
own moral inadequacy so they're fools

1017
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:56,280
and but but the thing that's so

1018
00:40:54,750 --> 00:40:57,570
interesting is that despite the fact

1019
00:40:56,280 --> 00:41:00,030
that they're fools they're still

1020
00:40:57,570 --> 00:41:02,220
supposed to go on the adventure and that

1021
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:03,900
they're capable of learning enough as a

1022
00:41:02,220 --> 00:41:05,490
consequence of moving forward on the

1023
00:41:03,900 --> 00:41:08,190
adventure so that they straighten

1024
00:41:05,490 --> 00:41:09,230
themselves out across time and so it's

1025
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:11,160
something like this so this

1026
00:41:09,230 --> 00:41:14,190
circumambulation that young talked about

1027
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:16,710
was this continual will return to this

1028
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:19,170
this continual circling in some sense of

1029
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:20,580
who you could be you might notice for

1030
00:41:19,170 --> 00:41:22,080
example that there are themes in your

1031
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:24,360
life you know when you go back across

1032
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:26,010
your experiences you see you kind of

1033
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:28,500
have your typical experience that sort

1034
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:30,930
of repeats itself and there might be

1035
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:33,720
variation on it like a musical theme but

1036
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:35,820
it's it's like you're circling yourself

1037
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:37,050
and getting closer to yourself as you

1038
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:39,060
move across time

1039
00:41:37,050 --> 00:41:40,380
that's the circumambulation now you

1040
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:42,090
remember that for a second as well go

1041
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:44,370
back to it okay so imagine that

1042
00:41:42,090 --> 00:41:47,070
something glimmers before you it's an

1043
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:49,020
interest that's dawning and you decide

1044
00:41:47,070 --> 00:41:50,310
well first of all you're paralyzed you

1045
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:52,230
think well how do I know if I should

1046
00:41:50,310 --> 00:41:54,570
pursue that it's probably a stupid idea

1047
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:56,280
and the proper response to that is

1048
00:41:54,570 --> 00:41:57,839
you're right it probably is a stupid

1049
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:00,690
idea because almost all

1050
00:41:57,839 --> 00:42:03,359
all ideas are stupid and so the

1051
00:42:00,690 --> 00:42:04,829
probability that as you move forward on

1052
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:07,859
your adventure that you're gonna get it

1053
00:42:04,829 --> 00:42:08,759
right the first time is zero it's just

1054
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:10,829
not gonna happen

1055
00:42:08,759 --> 00:42:12,930
and so then you might think well maybe

1056
00:42:10,829 --> 00:42:13,589
I'll just wait around until I get the

1057
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:15,809
right idea

1058
00:42:13,589 --> 00:42:17,759
and which people do right so they're

1059
00:42:15,809 --> 00:42:20,099
like 40 year old thirteen year olds

1060
00:42:17,759 --> 00:42:22,109
which is not a good idea so they wait

1061
00:42:20,099 --> 00:42:24,660
around until it's Waiting for Godot

1062
00:42:22,109 --> 00:42:26,069
until they finally got it right but the

1063
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:27,930
problem is you're too stupid to know

1064
00:42:26,069 --> 00:42:29,219
when you've got it right so waiting

1065
00:42:27,930 --> 00:42:31,289
around isn't gonna help

1066
00:42:29,219 --> 00:42:33,569
because even if it the perfect

1067
00:42:31,289 --> 00:42:36,210
opportunity manifested itself to you in

1068
00:42:33,569 --> 00:42:37,589
your incomplete form the probability

1069
00:42:36,210 --> 00:42:39,930
that you would recognize it as the

1070
00:42:37,589 --> 00:42:42,029
perfect opportunity is zero you might

1071
00:42:39,930 --> 00:42:43,440
even think it's the worst possible idea

1072
00:42:42,029 --> 00:42:47,369
that you've ever heard of anywhere

1073
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:49,739
highly likely highly likely so so you

1074
00:42:47,369 --> 00:42:52,170
had there's niches nature called data

1075
00:42:49,739 --> 00:42:54,569
will will - stupidity which I really

1076
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:57,779
liked so because he thought of stupidity

1077
00:42:54,569 --> 00:42:59,969
as being it you know it's it's you have

1078
00:42:57,779 --> 00:43:02,849
to take it into account fundamentally

1079
00:42:59,969 --> 00:43:05,450
and work with it and so and so you can

1080
00:43:02,849 --> 00:43:08,549
take these tentative steps on your

1081
00:43:05,450 --> 00:43:10,529
pathway to destiny and you can assume

1082
00:43:08,549 --> 00:43:12,479
that you're gonna do it badly and that's

1083
00:43:10,529 --> 00:43:13,979
really useful because you don't have to

1084
00:43:12,479 --> 00:43:16,289
beat yourself up it's pretty easy to do

1085
00:43:13,979 --> 00:43:18,029
it badly but the thing is it's way

1086
00:43:16,289 --> 00:43:20,940
better to do it badly than not to do it

1087
00:43:18,029 --> 00:43:23,279
at all and that's the continual message

1088
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:25,469
that echoes through these historical

1089
00:43:23,279 --> 00:43:27,900
stories in Genesis it's like these are

1090
00:43:25,469 --> 00:43:29,339
flawed people they should have got the

1091
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:32,369
hell out of their house way before they

1092
00:43:29,339 --> 00:43:35,160
did and they go out and they stumble

1093
00:43:32,369 --> 00:43:39,420
around in tyranny and famine and self

1094
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:41,160
betrayal and and violence and but it's a

1095
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:43,950
hell of a lot better than just rotting

1096
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:46,380
away at home and that's the that's great

1097
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:48,450
so that's good and so why is that well

1098
00:43:46,380 --> 00:43:49,979
okay so you you start your path and you

1099
00:43:48,450 --> 00:43:52,859
think that you're heading you know

1100
00:43:49,979 --> 00:43:56,819
towards your star and so you go in that

1101
00:43:52,859 --> 00:43:58,499
direction and then because you're here

1102
00:43:56,819 --> 00:44:01,589
the world looks a particular way but

1103
00:43:58,499 --> 00:44:03,390
then when you move here the world looks

1104
00:44:01,589 --> 00:44:05,190
different and you're different as a

1105
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:07,529
consequence of having made that voyage

1106
00:44:05,190 --> 00:44:09,359
and so what that means is that now that

1107
00:44:07,529 --> 00:44:10,980
thing that glimmers in front of you is

1108
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:13,320
going to have shifted

1109
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:15,510
location because you weren't very good

1110
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:17,000
at specifying it to begin with and now

1111
00:44:15,510 --> 00:44:20,280
that you're a little sharper and more

1112
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:22,920
focused than you were it's it's going to

1113
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:27,240
reveal itself with more accuracy to you

1114
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:30,359
and so then you have to take you know

1115
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:32,609
it's almost like 180 degree reversal but

1116
00:44:30,359 --> 00:44:36,570
it isn't because you know you've

1117
00:44:32,609 --> 00:44:40,170
I mean you've gone this far and that's a

1118
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:43,170
long ways to get that far but that's a

1119
00:44:40,170 --> 00:44:45,020
lot farther than you would be if you

1120
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:48,800
just stayed where you were waiting and

1121
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:52,700
so it doesn't matter that you overshoot

1122
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:55,410
continually because as you overshoot

1123
00:44:52,700 --> 00:44:56,850
even if you don't learn what you should

1124
00:44:55,410 --> 00:44:59,660
have done you're going to continually

1125
00:44:56,850 --> 00:45:02,340
learn what you shouldn't keep doing and

1126
00:44:59,660 --> 00:45:04,650
if you learn enough about what you

1127
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:06,900
shouldn't keep doing then that's

1128
00:45:04,650 --> 00:45:08,300
tantamount at some point to learning at

1129
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:14,310
the same time what you should be doing

1130
00:45:08,300 --> 00:45:16,020
so it's okay so it's like this now

1131
00:45:14,310 --> 00:45:19,290
what's cool about it though I think is

1132
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:22,020
that as you progress the degree of

1133
00:45:19,290 --> 00:45:23,790
overshooting starts to decline right and

1134
00:45:22,020 --> 00:45:25,890
that we know that there's nothing

1135
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:27,930
hypothetical about that as you learn a

1136
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:29,700
new skill like even to play it play a

1137
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:31,410
song on the piano for example you over

1138
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:33,119
shoot madly you're making all sorts of

1139
00:45:31,410 --> 00:45:39,680
mistakes to begin with and then the

1140
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:42,570
mistakes they disappear there's a great

1141
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:45,060
TED talk I think it was about this guy

1142
00:45:42,570 --> 00:45:47,010
set up a really advanced computational

1143
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:49,350
recording system in his home and

1144
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:52,530
recorded every single utterance his

1145
00:45:49,350 --> 00:45:55,260
young child made while learning to speak

1146
00:45:52,530 --> 00:45:59,340
and then he put together the child's

1147
00:45:55,260 --> 00:46:00,540
attempts to say certain phonemes and put

1148
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:03,570
them in the list and you can hear the

1149
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:05,220
child deviating madly to begin with and

1150
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:07,890
then after hundreds and hundreds of

1151
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:11,010
repetitions just zeroing right in on the

1152
00:46:07,890 --> 00:46:12,690
exact phoneme so you know I you might

1153
00:46:11,010 --> 00:46:14,130
not know this but when kids babble

1154
00:46:12,690 --> 00:46:16,140
because they start babbling when they're

1155
00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:18,840
quite young they babble every human

1156
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:21,420
phoneme including all sorts of phonemes

1157
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:24,810
that adults can't say and then they they

1158
00:46:21,420 --> 00:46:27,240
die into their language so that after

1159
00:46:24,810 --> 00:46:28,560
they learn say English then there's all

1160
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:30,480
sorts of phonemes they can no longer

1161
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:31,080
hear or pronounce but to begin with it's

1162
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,610
all there

1163
00:46:31,080 --> 00:46:35,430
which is really quite interesting but so

1164
00:46:32,610 --> 00:46:37,890
they zip as they learn a particular

1165
00:46:35,430 --> 00:46:40,320
language they zero in on the proper way

1166
00:46:37,890 --> 00:46:42,120
to pronounce that and their errors

1167
00:46:40,320 --> 00:46:43,440
minimize and every time you learn

1168
00:46:42,120 --> 00:46:45,000
something that's how it is and that's

1169
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:46,890
really useful to know too because it

1170
00:46:45,000 --> 00:46:50,640
means that it's okay to wander around

1171
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:52,860
stupidly before you fix your destination

1172
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:54,840
now you see that echoed in exodus right

1173
00:46:52,860 --> 00:46:57,300
because what happens is that the

1174
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:59,780
Egyptians or the Hebrews escaped a

1175
00:46:57,300 --> 00:47:02,220
tyranny which is kind of whatever you do

1176
00:46:59,780 --> 00:47:04,140
personally and psychologically when you

1177
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:07,260
escape from your previous set of

1178
00:47:04,140 --> 00:47:09,660
stupidly held and ignorant and stubborn

1179
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:11,520
axioms it's like away from that tyranny

1180
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:14,310
it's like great I freed myself from that

1181
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:15,900
well then what well you think well now

1182
00:47:14,310 --> 00:47:18,030
I'm on the way it's no you're not now

1183
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:20,820
you're in the desert where you wander

1184
00:47:18,030 --> 00:47:23,760
around stupidly you know and worship the

1185
00:47:20,820 --> 00:47:26,100
wrong things until you finally organize

1186
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:27,750
yourself morally again and head in the

1187
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:31,020
proper direction so that's worth knowing

1188
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:33,450
too because you think well I got rid of

1189
00:47:31,020 --> 00:47:35,130
a lot of things baggage excess baggage

1190
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:37,020
that I didn't need in my life and now

1191
00:47:35,130 --> 00:47:38,880
everything's okay it's like no it's not

1192
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:40,770
you've got rid of a whole set of

1193
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:43,170
scaffolds that were keeping you in place

1194
00:47:40,770 --> 00:47:45,510
even though they were pathological now

1195
00:47:43,170 --> 00:47:47,690
you have nothing and nothing actually

1196
00:47:45,510 --> 00:47:50,220
turns out to be better than something

1197
00:47:47,690 --> 00:47:52,770
pathological but you're still stuck with

1198
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:54,540
the problem of nothing and and that's

1199
00:47:52,770 --> 00:47:56,190
well that's exactly why exodus is

1200
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:58,440
structured the way that it is it's that

1201
00:47:56,190 --> 00:48:00,330
you escape from eternity its terrain

1202
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:02,910
we're no longer slaves yeah well now

1203
00:48:00,330 --> 00:48:06,000
you're nihilistic and lost it's not

1204
00:48:02,910 --> 00:48:08,610
necessarily an improvement but it is but

1205
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:10,740
it is the pre see it's also useful to

1206
00:48:08,610 --> 00:48:13,020
know that because you can also be

1207
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:14,070
deluded into the idea that imagine that

1208
00:48:13,020 --> 00:48:16,470
you're trying to become enlightened

1209
00:48:14,070 --> 00:48:18,420
which might mean to turn all those parts

1210
00:48:16,470 --> 00:48:19,920
of you on that could be turned on you

1211
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:22,020
think well that's just a linear pathway

1212
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:24,390
uphill you know it's just from one

1213
00:48:22,020 --> 00:48:25,740
success to another it's no it's not it's

1214
00:48:24,390 --> 00:48:27,090
like here you are and you're not doing

1215
00:48:25,740 --> 00:48:29,310
too badly and the first step is a

1216
00:48:27,090 --> 00:48:31,710
complete bloody catastrophe it's worse

1217
00:48:29,310 --> 00:48:34,320
and then maybe you can pull yourself

1218
00:48:31,710 --> 00:48:36,240
together and you hit a new plateau and

1219
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:38,550
then that crumbles and shakes and bang

1220
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:39,690
it's worse again and so

1221
00:48:38,550 --> 00:48:41,480
because part of the reason that people

1222
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:44,910
don't become enlightened is because it's

1223
00:48:41,480 --> 00:48:47,220
punctuated by intermittent deserts

1224
00:48:44,910 --> 00:48:48,960
essentially by intermittent catastrophes

1225
00:48:47,220 --> 00:48:51,090
and if you don't know that well then

1226
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:53,190
you're basically screwed because you go

1227
00:48:51,090 --> 00:48:54,810
ahead on your movement forward and you

1228
00:48:53,190 --> 00:48:57,870
collapse and you think well that didn't

1229
00:48:54,810 --> 00:49:00,540
work I collapsed it's like no that's par

1230
00:48:57,870 --> 00:49:02,070
for the course it's not indication that

1231
00:49:00,540 --> 00:49:04,500
you failed it's just indication that

1232
00:49:02,070 --> 00:49:06,540
it's really hard and that when you learn

1233
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:08,070
something you also unlearn something and

1234
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:09,840
the thing you unlearned is probably

1235
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:10,620
useful and unlearning it actually is

1236
00:49:09,840 --> 00:49:11,790
painful

1237
00:49:10,620 --> 00:49:13,770
you know let's say if you have to get

1238
00:49:11,790 --> 00:49:16,140
out of a bad relationship it's like not

1239
00:49:13,770 --> 00:49:17,520
every not any real there isn't any

1240
00:49:16,140 --> 00:49:20,760
relationship that's a hundred percent

1241
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:22,590
bad and so when you jump out of it well

1242
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:24,210
maybe you're in better shape but you're

1243
00:49:22,590 --> 00:49:25,590
still lonesome and disoriented and you

1244
00:49:24,210 --> 00:49:26,790
don't know what your past was and you

1245
00:49:25,590 --> 00:49:28,290
don't know what your present is and you

1246
00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:31,380
don't know what your future is it's

1247
00:49:28,290 --> 00:49:33,360
that's not that's why people stay with

1248
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:36,350
the devil they know instead of you know

1249
00:49:33,360 --> 00:49:40,770
looking for the devil they don't know so

1250
00:49:36,350 --> 00:49:43,610
so anyways the fact that you're full of

1251
00:49:40,770 --> 00:49:45,900
faults doesn't mean you have to stop and

1252
00:49:43,610 --> 00:49:48,330
thank God for that that's a really

1253
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:50,130
useful thing and the fact that you're

1254
00:49:48,330 --> 00:49:52,980
full of faults doesn't mean that you

1255
00:49:50,130 --> 00:49:55,230
can't learn and so you can pause it an

1256
00:49:52,980 --> 00:49:56,850
ideal and you're gonna be wrong about it

1257
00:49:55,230 --> 00:49:58,680
but it doesn't matter because what

1258
00:49:56,850 --> 00:50:01,200
you're right about is positing the ideal

1259
00:49:58,680 --> 00:50:05,760
moving towards it if the actual ideal

1260
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:07,650
isn't conceptualize perfectly well first

1261
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:10,530
surprise surprise cuz like what are you

1262
00:50:07,650 --> 00:50:12,270
going to do that's perfect so it doesn't

1263
00:50:10,530 --> 00:50:13,770
matter that it's imperfect imperfect it

1264
00:50:12,270 --> 00:50:15,930
just matters that you do it and that you

1265
00:50:13,770 --> 00:50:17,670
move forward so that's really that's

1266
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:19,080
really positive news as far as I'm

1267
00:50:17,670 --> 00:50:21,780
concerned because you can actually do

1268
00:50:19,080 --> 00:50:25,710
that right you can do it badly anyone

1269
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:27,240
can do that so that's that's useful okay

1270
00:50:25,710 --> 00:50:29,700
so like if you were an efficient person

1271
00:50:27,240 --> 00:50:32,100
you would have just done that but you're

1272
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:34,950
not but who cares you know you still end

1273
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:36,570
up in the in the same place and maybe

1274
00:50:34,950 --> 00:50:40,500
the trip is even more interesting who

1275
00:50:36,570 --> 00:50:42,750
knows probably two interesting young I

1276
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:44,490
began to understand that the goal of

1277
00:50:42,750 --> 00:50:46,110
psychic development by which he means

1278
00:50:44,490 --> 00:50:50,850
psychological development or spiritual

1279
00:50:46,110 --> 00:50:52,200
development is the self there's no

1280
00:50:50,850 --> 00:50:54,000
linear evolution

1281
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:55,619
there's only a circumambulation of the

1282
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:58,339
self a getting closer it's like it's

1283
00:50:55,619 --> 00:51:00,180
like you're spiraling into something

1284
00:50:58,339 --> 00:51:02,130
something like that and the thing that

1285
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:05,690
you're spiraling into recedes as you

1286
00:51:02,130 --> 00:51:08,070
move towards it and gets more and more

1287
00:51:05,690 --> 00:51:09,359
sophisticated and well developed as you

1288
00:51:08,070 --> 00:51:11,099
move towards it because you're not gonna

1289
00:51:09,359 --> 00:51:12,750
run out of goals right no matter how

1290
00:51:11,099 --> 00:51:15,930
much you have your act together

1291
00:51:12,750 --> 00:51:18,089
there's probably undoubtedly 30

1292
00:51:15,930 --> 00:51:20,700
dimensions along which you could get

1293
00:51:18,089 --> 00:51:22,349
your act together a lot more so and some

1294
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:25,560
of those aren't even conceivable to you

1295
00:51:22,349 --> 00:51:28,589
when you're in your initial on carved

1296
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:30,210
state let's say uniform development

1297
00:51:28,589 --> 00:51:32,310
exists at most at the beginning later

1298
00:51:30,210 --> 00:51:34,200
everything points towards the center

1299
00:51:32,310 --> 00:51:41,190
this insight gave me stability and

1300
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:41,910
gradually my inner peace returned so

1301
00:51:41,190 --> 00:51:44,130
this is fun

1302
00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:45,660
on the left there that's the short

1303
00:51:44,130 --> 00:51:48,329
Cathedral that's the one that has the

1304
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:50,339
maze in it that I told you about they

1305
00:51:48,329 --> 00:51:53,430
actually light that up with lasers now

1306
00:51:50,339 --> 00:51:55,859
and so that's it lit up with lasers and

1307
00:51:53,430 --> 00:51:57,780
so so they're turning it into a

1308
00:51:55,859 --> 00:51:59,970
Cathedral of light which i think is

1309
00:51:57,780 --> 00:52:01,710
really fascinating and it's a it's a

1310
00:51:59,970 --> 00:52:03,450
continuation of the same idea right

1311
00:52:01,710 --> 00:52:05,670
because the stained glass windows were

1312
00:52:03,450 --> 00:52:07,500
obviously I wouldn't call them primitive

1313
00:52:05,670 --> 00:52:09,420
attempts to do that I mean stained glass

1314
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:11,760
windows are pretty impressive you know

1315
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:13,079
buddy it's an elaboration of the same

1316
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:14,640
thing so now you can go to that

1317
00:52:13,079 --> 00:52:16,950
Cathedral they light up the whole town

1318
00:52:14,640 --> 00:52:18,630
like that which is really something and

1319
00:52:16,950 --> 00:52:21,900
so there and there's how the cathedral

1320
00:52:18,630 --> 00:52:24,089
is built it's a cross and remember the

1321
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:25,589
cross is an X that marks the center of

1322
00:52:24,089 --> 00:52:27,270
the world and the cross is the place

1323
00:52:25,589 --> 00:52:29,550
where each individual is and I think

1324
00:52:27,270 --> 00:52:32,160
that's the fundamental message of

1325
00:52:29,550 --> 00:52:33,839
Christianity is the cross marks the

1326
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:37,200
place where every single individual is

1327
00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:39,660
and it's a tragic place that consists of

1328
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:41,970
suffering and exposure to malevolence

1329
00:52:39,660 --> 00:52:44,849
and that the only way to come to terms

1330
00:52:41,970 --> 00:52:47,099
with it is to accept it and that seems

1331
00:52:44,849 --> 00:52:48,720
to me I don't see anything metaphysical

1332
00:52:47,099 --> 00:52:50,940
about that statement whatsoever it's

1333
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:53,430
like well x marks the spot

1334
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:55,109
fair enough you're in a spot you're

1335
00:52:53,430 --> 00:52:56,730
right in the center of your world it's

1336
00:52:55,109 --> 00:52:58,020
right in the center of the world as far

1337
00:52:56,730 --> 00:53:00,480
as you're concerned and the same with

1338
00:52:58,020 --> 00:53:02,280
the rest of us it's characterized by

1339
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:04,170
suffering and exposure to malevolence

1340
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:05,490
there's no doubt about that what are you

1341
00:53:04,170 --> 00:53:08,490
gonna do about that

1342
00:53:05,490 --> 00:53:11,040
bitter resentful hateful all that does

1343
00:53:08,490 --> 00:53:13,350
is make it worse so you have to accept

1344
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:14,820
it now that's not an easy thing because

1345
00:53:13,350 --> 00:53:16,920
that's actually I would say a heroic

1346
00:53:14,820 --> 00:53:18,510
task to voluntarily accept the

1347
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:21,210
conditions of your own existence and

1348
00:53:18,510 --> 00:53:23,280
that happens out the cross so that's

1349
00:53:21,210 --> 00:53:25,800
fine and that's associated with light

1350
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:26,970
well that's good that that's associated

1351
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:28,800
with light you wouldn't want that to be

1352
00:53:26,970 --> 00:53:37,530
associated with darkness that would be a

1353
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:43,950
bad thing so and so there's the there's

1354
00:53:37,530 --> 00:53:47,160
the the labyrinth that was built in 1280

1355
00:53:43,950 --> 00:53:50,060
and so the idea is you walk in here it's

1356
00:53:47,160 --> 00:53:52,560
the same idea as that star sequence of

1357
00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:56,540
slides that I just showed you so here's

1358
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:59,010
the ideas that north south west and east

1359
00:53:56,540 --> 00:54:01,410
so that's the whole world laid out in

1360
00:53:59,010 --> 00:54:02,850
two dimensions and so the question is

1361
00:54:01,410 --> 00:54:03,960
how do you get to the center now we

1362
00:54:02,850 --> 00:54:06,150
already know what the center is the

1363
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:08,160
center is the center of the cross that's

1364
00:54:06,150 --> 00:54:11,400
the place of maximal suffering you could

1365
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:13,080
say maximal malevolence as well but it's

1366
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:15,600
also the place where that's transcendent

1367
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:17,280
so how do you get there well the answer

1368
00:54:15,600 --> 00:54:19,890
is well you don't just stand on the

1369
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:22,830
outside looking in

1370
00:54:19,890 --> 00:54:25,230
that's not gonna help so and you can't

1371
00:54:22,830 --> 00:54:30,780
just run right to the center even if

1372
00:54:25,230 --> 00:54:33,810
you're in California and so you have to

1373
00:54:30,780 --> 00:54:37,590
walk in here and then you see you go

1374
00:54:33,810 --> 00:54:41,580
like this and you go to every single

1375
00:54:37,590 --> 00:54:44,100
place every single place on that on that

1376
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:46,050
little cosmos and then once you've gone

1377
00:54:44,100 --> 00:54:47,940
to every single place and expanded

1378
00:54:46,050 --> 00:54:50,760
yourself as a consequence of going north

1379
00:54:47,940 --> 00:54:52,740
and west and east and south then there's

1380
00:54:50,760 --> 00:54:54,780
enough of you so that you're at so that

1381
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:55,920
you can tolerate being first of all that

1382
00:54:54,780 --> 00:54:57,930
you could figure out where the center is

1383
00:54:55,920 --> 00:55:00,000
but also that you can tolerate being at

1384
00:54:57,930 --> 00:55:03,119
the center and so that's what that

1385
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:05,070
represents that's pretty and look I mean

1386
00:55:03,119 --> 00:55:07,170
let's make no mistake about it hey

1387
00:55:05,070 --> 00:55:09,750
people were pretty damn serious about

1388
00:55:07,170 --> 00:55:11,760
those ideas like that's a that's quite

1389
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:12,420
the piece of work for people in the 12th

1390
00:55:11,760 --> 00:55:13,920
century

1391
00:55:12,420 --> 00:55:16,200
you know those some of those damn

1392
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:17,940
cathedrals took 300 years to build we

1393
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:19,060
don't build anything that takes 300

1394
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:20,980
years

1395
00:55:19,060 --> 00:55:24,220
people were putting a lot of effort into

1396
00:55:20,980 --> 00:55:25,750
whatever these things meant you know and

1397
00:55:24,220 --> 00:55:29,860
if you think they meant bearded man in

1398
00:55:25,750 --> 00:55:32,500
the sky then you know it's hard to it's

1399
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:34,450
hard to account for the kind of

1400
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:37,690
motivation that would produce these

1401
00:55:34,450 --> 00:55:40,360
buildings with that kind of paucity of

1402
00:55:37,690 --> 00:55:42,910
conceptualization you know the towns and

1403
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:45,670
and it was certainly the case in charge

1404
00:55:42,910 --> 00:55:47,380
is that they groaned under the tax

1405
00:55:45,670 --> 00:55:49,030
burden that was required to produce

1406
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:51,730
these now you might think well that's

1407
00:55:49,030 --> 00:55:55,570
partly tyrannical and no doubt that's

1408
00:55:51,730 --> 00:55:57,880
the case but but that's not the whole

1409
00:55:55,570 --> 00:55:59,650
story the whole story is that the people

1410
00:55:57,880 --> 00:56:03,040
who produce those buildings they thought

1411
00:55:59,650 --> 00:56:05,200
about every bit of it it's nothing's

1412
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:07,240
accidental and they're trying to portray

1413
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:08,620
something just like that window is

1414
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:11,470
trying to portray something that's the

1415
00:56:08,620 --> 00:56:14,110
same thing as this it's the center from

1416
00:56:11,470 --> 00:56:14,650
which all things manifest themselves you

1417
00:56:14,110 --> 00:56:17,800
see it

1418
00:56:14,650 --> 00:56:20,170
that's Christ there and being portrayed

1419
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:21,700
as as that center or the center within

1420
00:56:20,170 --> 00:56:26,020
him something like that very much like

1421
00:56:21,700 --> 00:56:29,560
the chakras and in in yogic practice

1422
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:32,200
same basic idea it's the opening up of

1423
00:56:29,560 --> 00:56:38,560
the internal structure and and and its

1424
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:45,340
proper realization so there are people

1425
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:47,940
walking the labyrinth so that's the coat

1426
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:49,900
of many colors right that's that's this

1427
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:52,780
differentiated mode of being that

1428
00:56:49,900 --> 00:56:55,900
enables you to be competent and at home

1429
00:56:52,780 --> 00:56:58,450
in the widest possible number of places

1430
00:56:55,900 --> 00:57:00,730
and that that's a real differentiation

1431
00:56:58,450 --> 00:57:02,350
of your personality it's a breaking

1432
00:57:00,730 --> 00:57:04,450
through the boundaries of your

1433
00:57:02,350 --> 00:57:09,040
personality including the ones that you

1434
00:57:04,450 --> 00:57:10,920
impose on yourself to become someone

1435
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:13,330
who's useful wherever they're put and

1436
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:16,690
that's really relevant to this story of

1437
00:57:13,330 --> 00:57:18,700
Joseph - because one of the things that

1438
00:57:16,690 --> 00:57:21,670
happens to Joseph is that well a lot of

1439
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:23,320
bad things happen to him because he's

1440
00:57:21,670 --> 00:57:25,720
the favorite of his father his brothers

1441
00:57:23,320 --> 00:57:27,760
hate him and so the first they're gonna

1442
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:29,740
throw him in a pit I think they do throw

1443
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:32,140
him in a pit then they sell them to be a

1444
00:57:29,740 --> 00:57:33,519
slave then he ends up in we'll go

1445
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:35,289
through the story

1446
00:57:33,519 --> 00:57:36,969
he ends up some places where you

1447
00:57:35,289 --> 00:57:41,289
probably wouldn't want to go prison

1448
00:57:36,969 --> 00:57:43,089
being one of them but it doesn't matter

1449
00:57:41,289 --> 00:57:46,419
because even when they put him in prison

1450
00:57:43,089 --> 00:57:47,739
he's actually not imprisoned he just

1451
00:57:46,419 --> 00:57:49,899
figures out how to make the prison work

1452
00:57:47,739 --> 00:57:52,359
way better and then he's in control of

1453
00:57:49,899 --> 00:57:55,719
the prison and it really it's an

1454
00:57:52,359 --> 00:57:58,569
interesting I had this friend you know

1455
00:57:55,719 --> 00:58:01,689
and he was very smart but very cynical

1456
00:57:58,569 --> 00:58:04,119
and he wasn't employed very well and he

1457
00:58:01,689 --> 00:58:06,659
got a little older and he should have

1458
00:58:04,119 --> 00:58:08,919
given his level of intelligence and

1459
00:58:06,659 --> 00:58:10,269
employability and so he had to take jobs

1460
00:58:08,919 --> 00:58:12,130
that weren't very intellectually

1461
00:58:10,269 --> 00:58:14,289
challenging you know and one of the

1462
00:58:12,130 --> 00:58:17,169
things I tried to convince him of was

1463
00:58:14,289 --> 00:58:18,999
that even if he worked he wanted to work

1464
00:58:17,169 --> 00:58:20,499
behind the parts department in an

1465
00:58:18,999 --> 00:58:22,899
automotive store because he liked cars

1466
00:58:20,499 --> 00:58:25,089
but it was beneath him you know because

1467
00:58:22,899 --> 00:58:27,880
it was sort of a as far as he was

1468
00:58:25,089 --> 00:58:29,919
concerned it was a he was too smart for

1469
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:31,239
a job like that which actually turned

1470
00:58:29,919 --> 00:58:32,589
out not to be true he wasn't smart

1471
00:58:31,239 --> 00:58:34,449
enough for a job like that or he wasn't

1472
00:58:32,589 --> 00:58:35,759
wise enough but you know what one of the

1473
00:58:34,449 --> 00:58:38,309
things I tried to tell him was then

1474
00:58:35,759 --> 00:58:41,469
you're looking at the situation wrong

1475
00:58:38,309 --> 00:58:43,749
because even in a simple job so-called

1476
00:58:41,469 --> 00:58:45,159
simple job like let's say dishwashing in

1477
00:58:43,749 --> 00:58:48,069
a restaurant which I did an awful lot of

1478
00:58:45,159 --> 00:58:50,229
it's not that simple you're dealing with

1479
00:58:48,069 --> 00:58:52,119
a lot of other people very fast staff

1480
00:58:50,229 --> 00:58:54,519
changeover you're feeding people you're

1481
00:58:52,119 --> 00:58:58,059
helping them have a celebration you're

1482
00:58:54,519 --> 00:59:00,549
helping them take a break like you can

1483
00:58:58,059 --> 00:59:02,469
do it really well and then the kitchen

1484
00:59:00,549 --> 00:59:03,669
can operate properly and then people can

1485
00:59:02,469 --> 00:59:06,699
come out to the restaurant it's not a

1486
00:59:03,669 --> 00:59:07,929
bloody catastrophe and like your even

1487
00:59:06,699 --> 00:59:10,299
when you're doing something that's a

1488
00:59:07,929 --> 00:59:12,369
menial job so to speak like dishwashing

1489
00:59:10,299 --> 00:59:15,009
there are ways of doing it really badly

1490
00:59:12,369 --> 00:59:17,229
resentfully and horribly and doing it

1491
00:59:15,009 --> 00:59:18,579
really well and as soon as you do it

1492
00:59:17,229 --> 00:59:19,149
really well it's not a menial job

1493
00:59:18,579 --> 00:59:22,089
anymore

1494
00:59:19,149 --> 00:59:23,709
it immediately transforms no I mean you

1495
00:59:22,089 --> 00:59:26,289
can be around people who won't let that

1496
00:59:23,709 --> 00:59:28,359
happen and you should go get another job

1497
00:59:26,289 --> 00:59:30,959
if that's the case but if you do it

1498
00:59:28,359 --> 00:59:35,529
properly then it's not menial at all and

1499
00:59:30,959 --> 00:59:37,029
that's also a good way out of resentment

1500
00:59:35,529 --> 00:59:38,589
you think well I've just got this you

1501
00:59:37,029 --> 00:59:40,809
know two-bit job it's like yeah what if

1502
00:59:38,589 --> 00:59:42,759
you did it as well as you possibly could

1503
00:59:40,809 --> 00:59:43,869
you know what would happen well the

1504
00:59:42,759 --> 00:59:46,029
first thing that would happen is you'd

1505
00:59:43,869 --> 00:59:47,279
get a lot smarter that's for sure and

1506
00:59:46,029 --> 00:59:52,289
that that's hardly

1507
00:59:47,279 --> 00:59:55,469
a negative thing okay so that's the coat

1508
00:59:52,289 --> 00:59:57,449
of many colors so it's an intimation of

1509
00:59:55,469 --> 00:59:58,949
what Joseph is like and what we're

1510
00:59:57,449 --> 01:00:01,890
seeing with all of these patriarchal

1511
00:59:58,949 --> 01:00:04,380
figures is the continual realization of

1512
01:00:01,890 --> 01:00:07,469
the ideal person right you could think

1513
01:00:04,380 --> 01:00:09,809
about it as successive approximations of

1514
01:00:07,469 --> 01:00:11,239
the ideal person and the story is

1515
01:00:09,809 --> 01:00:13,259
exploring all sorts of different

1516
01:00:11,239 --> 01:00:15,419
possibilities including ones that are

1517
01:00:13,259 --> 01:00:17,339
very violent and catastrophic and

1518
01:00:15,419 --> 01:00:20,299
malevolent it's trying to cover the

1519
01:00:17,339 --> 01:00:23,159
entire territory and to focus in on

1520
01:00:20,299 --> 01:00:27,089
what's the proper way through the maze

1521
01:00:23,159 --> 01:00:28,409
the maze of life the labyrinth and the

1522
01:00:27,089 --> 01:00:31,019
hint here is that while you should be

1523
01:00:28,409 --> 01:00:33,390
multi-dimensional these are the

1524
01:00:31,019 --> 01:00:34,949
generations of Jacob Joseph being 17

1525
01:00:33,390 --> 01:00:36,659
years old was feeding the flock with his

1526
01:00:34,949 --> 01:00:38,130
brethren and the lad was with his sons

1527
01:00:36,659 --> 01:00:40,619
of Bilhah and with the sons of Zilpah

1528
01:00:38,130 --> 01:00:45,109
his father's wives and Joseph brought

1529
01:00:40,619 --> 01:00:47,609
unto his father their evil report well

1530
01:00:45,109 --> 01:00:49,079
we already know that Joseph is Jacob's

1531
01:00:47,609 --> 01:00:52,049
favorite so that doesn't make him very

1532
01:00:49,079 --> 01:00:54,959
popular among his brothers he's younger

1533
01:00:52,049 --> 01:00:58,019
and now we also find out that he's been

1534
01:00:54,959 --> 01:01:00,089
set up more or less as you might say a

1535
01:00:58,019 --> 01:01:02,189
snitch because that's what this phrase

1536
01:01:00,089 --> 01:01:03,269
means is that he goes out and watches

1537
01:01:02,189 --> 01:01:04,890
his older brothers and if they do

1538
01:01:03,269 --> 01:01:08,009
something they shouldn't do then he

1539
01:01:04,890 --> 01:01:10,109
comes trotting back to Jacob and reports

1540
01:01:08,009 --> 01:01:12,419
well that's not gonna make you popular

1541
01:01:10,109 --> 01:01:18,029
so and you would say well is that

1542
01:01:12,419 --> 01:01:19,439
Joseph's problem or jacob's problem and

1543
01:01:18,029 --> 01:01:20,729
I would say and this is something I

1544
01:01:19,439 --> 01:01:23,819
learned from reading dealing to is that

1545
01:01:20,729 --> 01:01:26,189
that's a conspiratorial problem right is

1546
01:01:23,819 --> 01:01:29,249
it's the parents at fault but so is the

1547
01:01:26,189 --> 01:01:33,749
child who agrees to do that they've

1548
01:01:29,249 --> 01:01:35,099
they've got a little cabal going and you

1549
01:01:33,749 --> 01:01:37,739
might say well it's only the parents

1550
01:01:35,099 --> 01:01:40,709
fault but the son will be taking

1551
01:01:37,739 --> 01:01:42,929
advantage of every advantage that offers

1552
01:01:40,709 --> 01:01:47,130
him because he could say no to I won't

1553
01:01:42,929 --> 01:01:49,949
do that so anyway so Joseph is the

1554
01:01:47,130 --> 01:01:53,099
favorite he's a bit of a teacher's pet

1555
01:01:49,949 --> 01:01:54,509
that's what it looks like now Israel

1556
01:01:53,099 --> 01:01:55,859
loved Joseph more than all his colors

1557
01:01:54,509 --> 01:01:57,799
because he was the son of his old age

1558
01:01:55,859 --> 01:02:00,029
and he made him a coat of many colors

1559
01:01:57,799 --> 01:02:01,230
and when his brethren saw that their

1560
01:02:00,029 --> 01:02:02,550
father loved him more than

1561
01:02:01,230 --> 01:02:04,650
all his brethren they hated him and

1562
01:02:02,550 --> 01:02:07,350
could not speak peaceably unto him so

1563
01:02:04,650 --> 01:02:08,430
let's say you have a child or number of

1564
01:02:07,350 --> 01:02:10,369
children and one of them is your

1565
01:02:08,430 --> 01:02:13,170
favorite how should you treat that child

1566
01:02:10,369 --> 01:02:15,660
well it isn't obvious that you do them

1567
01:02:13,170 --> 01:02:18,540
any favors by overtly making them your

1568
01:02:15,660 --> 01:02:20,130
favorite right I mean first of all maybe

1569
01:02:18,540 --> 01:02:22,320
you don't challenge them as much as you

1570
01:02:20,130 --> 01:02:25,109
should and second of all you definitely

1571
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:27,390
set up a Cain and Abel like scenario in

1572
01:02:25,109 --> 01:02:29,100
the household and that or maybe it's an

1573
01:02:27,390 --> 01:02:30,330
eatable situation too because you happen

1574
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:33,150
to love your child more than you love

1575
01:02:30,330 --> 01:02:37,980
your your spouse which is that's not a

1576
01:02:33,150 --> 01:02:40,200
recipe for familial harmony so it seems

1577
01:02:37,980 --> 01:02:43,500
to be a bad idea okay so now we have two

1578
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:46,590
reasons that Joseph is not liked by his

1579
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:49,140
brothers is one is well he's a bit of a

1580
01:02:46,590 --> 01:02:51,090
Rat Fink and the other is that he's the

1581
01:02:49,140 --> 01:02:52,920
peas the favorite and he's playing that

1582
01:02:51,090 --> 01:02:54,480
to the hilt by the looks of things and

1583
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:56,000
when his brethren saw that their father

1584
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:58,380
loved him more than all his brethren

1585
01:02:56,000 --> 01:03:02,190
then all his brethren they hated him and

1586
01:02:58,380 --> 01:03:04,530
could not speak peaceably unto him okay

1587
01:03:02,190 --> 01:03:06,450
and Joseph dreamed a dream and he told

1588
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:10,440
it to his brethren and they hated him

1589
01:03:06,450 --> 01:03:12,000
the more he said unto them hear I pray

1590
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:14,550
you this dream which I have dreamed for

1591
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:17,210
behold we were binding wheat sheaves in

1592
01:03:14,550 --> 01:03:19,560
the field and lo my sheaf arose and

1593
01:03:17,210 --> 01:03:25,770
behold your sheaves stood round about

1594
01:03:19,560 --> 01:03:27,420
and bowed to my sheaf and his and

1595
01:03:25,770 --> 01:03:29,520
remember he's yeah the young one right

1596
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:31,109
and and also the daughter of the

1597
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:32,550
favorite wife which is another thing

1598
01:03:31,109 --> 01:03:33,540
that's or the son of the favorite wife

1599
01:03:32,550 --> 01:03:35,670
which is another thing not really

1600
01:03:33,540 --> 01:03:38,040
working in his favor and his brethren

1601
01:03:35,670 --> 01:03:39,570
said to him shalt thou indeed reign over

1602
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:42,390
us or shalt thou indeed have dominion

1603
01:03:39,570 --> 01:03:44,520
over us and they hated them yet the more

1604
01:03:42,390 --> 01:03:46,680
for his dreams and for his words well

1605
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:48,869
there there's a shock you know that

1606
01:03:46,680 --> 01:03:50,940
makes perfect sense so and it gets worse

1607
01:03:48,869 --> 01:03:54,750
so you see here well there's the wheat

1608
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:56,460
sheaves bowing there and and then you

1609
01:03:54,750 --> 01:03:58,800
see this what's going on here well

1610
01:03:56,460 --> 01:04:02,820
that's not the end of his let's call it

1611
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:04,109
grandiosity and there's an idea to in in

1612
01:04:02,820 --> 01:04:05,850
the Old Testament especially in the

1613
01:04:04,109 --> 01:04:08,340
stories of Joseph that if God sends you

1614
01:04:05,850 --> 01:04:09,720
a dream twice he really means it and so

1615
01:04:08,340 --> 01:04:11,250
I don't know if that's true although I

1616
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:14,530
do know that people have repeating

1617
01:04:11,250 --> 01:04:17,080
dreams it might be true that the a dream

1618
01:04:14,530 --> 01:04:18,640
you have twice is really trying to punch

1619
01:04:17,080 --> 01:04:21,240
something home you know it's certainly

1620
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:23,620
the case that recurrent nightmares are

1621
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:26,350
meaningful and that recurrent nightmares

1622
01:04:23,620 --> 01:04:28,510
are associated quite tightly with

1623
01:04:26,350 --> 01:04:30,160
decreased states of mental health and

1624
01:04:28,510 --> 01:04:32,740
that if you can treat the nightmare

1625
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:35,800
which is often quite easy by the way

1626
01:04:32,740 --> 01:04:38,230
then the some of the mental health

1627
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:40,540
problems will decrease so repeated

1628
01:04:38,230 --> 01:04:42,160
dreams seem to be important anyways he

1629
01:04:40,540 --> 01:04:44,080
dreamed yet another dream and told it to

1630
01:04:42,160 --> 01:04:47,020
his brethren and said behold I've had

1631
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:48,880
another dream and be and behold the Sun

1632
01:04:47,020 --> 01:04:52,330
and the moon and the Eleven stars bowed

1633
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:54,100
to me and he told it to his father and

1634
01:04:52,330 --> 01:04:55,960
to his brothers and his father rebuked

1635
01:04:54,100 --> 01:04:57,580
him and said unto you unto Him what is

1636
01:04:55,960 --> 01:05:00,040
this dream that thou has dreamed shall I

1637
01:04:57,580 --> 01:05:02,260
in my and your mother and your brothers

1638
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:05,440
indeed come to bow down ourselves to

1639
01:05:02,260 --> 01:05:08,290
thee to the earth and his brethren

1640
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:11,050
envied him but his father observed to

1641
01:05:08,290 --> 01:05:12,760
saying well what the hell do you make of

1642
01:05:11,050 --> 01:05:15,670
something like that right if someone

1643
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:17,790
tells you that it's like are they

1644
01:05:15,670 --> 01:05:19,900
responsible for their dreams

1645
01:05:17,790 --> 01:05:22,240
we don't really seem we don't really

1646
01:05:19,900 --> 01:05:24,190
hold ourselves responsible for for the

1647
01:05:22,240 --> 01:05:26,230
dreams we have at night and what do you

1648
01:05:24,190 --> 01:05:27,700
make of a dream is like one of the

1649
01:05:26,230 --> 01:05:28,930
things that Jung pointed out this is

1650
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:31,360
where he differed from Freud

1651
01:05:28,930 --> 01:05:34,480
substantially as Freud tended to think

1652
01:05:31,360 --> 01:05:36,970
that the dream hid its meaning because

1653
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:39,430
its contents weren't acceptable to the

1654
01:05:36,970 --> 01:05:41,410
conscious mind and Jung said no no you

1655
01:05:39,430 --> 01:05:43,030
don't understand that's not what happens

1656
01:05:41,410 --> 01:05:45,640
what happens is the dream is doing the

1657
01:05:43,030 --> 01:05:47,890
best it can to express something that

1658
01:05:45,640 --> 01:05:49,600
the person doesn't yet really know and

1659
01:05:47,890 --> 01:05:51,520
Jung thought about the dream as a

1660
01:05:49,600 --> 01:05:53,110
manifestation of nature it wasn't

1661
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:55,690
associated with the ego at all it was

1662
01:05:53,110 --> 01:05:57,250
just like you have a dream and there are

1663
01:05:55,690 --> 01:05:58,750
things happening and it the same way

1664
01:05:57,250 --> 01:06:00,820
that when you walk into a dinner party

1665
01:05:58,750 --> 01:06:03,310
there are things happening there you

1666
01:06:00,820 --> 01:06:05,320
know it's not the dream isn't something

1667
01:06:03,310 --> 01:06:07,030
that's subject to your capacity for

1668
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:09,670
manipulation it's something that happens

1669
01:06:07,030 --> 01:06:11,800
to you not something that you do and so

1670
01:06:09,670 --> 01:06:13,720
so if someone has a dream like that well

1671
01:06:11,800 --> 01:06:16,630
you've got three options you can just

1672
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:18,220
discount dreams altogether which is what

1673
01:06:16,630 --> 01:06:21,100
people in the modern world tend to do

1674
01:06:18,220 --> 01:06:22,510
which is a very bad idea because there

1675
01:06:21,100 --> 01:06:25,030
are thoughts and you shouldn't discount

1676
01:06:22,510 --> 01:06:26,950
them you know I mean and they're hardly

1677
01:06:25,030 --> 01:06:27,760
random as some neuroscientists claim

1678
01:06:26,950 --> 01:06:30,609
that's

1679
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:33,310
absolutely cockeyed theory that random

1680
01:06:30,609 --> 01:06:36,460
he like television snow on a TV set if

1681
01:06:33,310 --> 01:06:38,320
it was random so so one is while you

1682
01:06:36,460 --> 01:06:40,210
just discount dreams the other is that

1683
01:06:38,320 --> 01:06:42,850
you consider the person a liar and a

1684
01:06:40,210 --> 01:06:46,869
braggart and a narcissist and the third

1685
01:06:42,850 --> 01:06:48,670
is well what's the third it's like he

1686
01:06:46,869 --> 01:06:52,420
dreamt that the Sun and the moon and the

1687
01:06:48,670 --> 01:06:54,940
stars bowed down to him you might think

1688
01:06:52,420 --> 01:06:56,260
about that two or three times so but

1689
01:06:54,940 --> 01:06:58,900
it's not necessarily something that's

1690
01:06:56,260 --> 01:07:00,550
going to make you happy and his brethren

1691
01:06:58,900 --> 01:07:02,440
went to feed their father's flock and

1692
01:07:00,550 --> 01:07:04,900
shechem so they took off and Israel said

1693
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:06,670
unto Joseph do you not thy brethren feed

1694
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:08,820
the flock and Shechem come and I will

1695
01:07:06,670 --> 01:07:12,700
send thee unto Him and he said him and

1696
01:07:08,820 --> 01:07:15,040
he said to him here here am I and when

1697
01:07:12,700 --> 01:07:16,690
they saw him afar off even before he

1698
01:07:15,040 --> 01:07:20,170
came near unto them they conspired

1699
01:07:16,690 --> 01:07:22,900
against him to slay him rough people

1700
01:07:20,170 --> 01:07:26,400
back then right this is this sort of

1701
01:07:22,900 --> 01:07:29,350
thing is happening quite frequently and

1702
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:32,530
they said to one another behold the

1703
01:07:29,350 --> 01:07:35,440
dreamer cometh come now therefore let us

1704
01:07:32,530 --> 01:07:37,270
slay him cast him into some pit and we

1705
01:07:35,440 --> 01:07:39,580
will say some evil beast hath devoured

1706
01:07:37,270 --> 01:07:41,800
him and we shall see what becomes of his

1707
01:07:39,580 --> 01:07:43,540
dreams so there's an echo of the Cain

1708
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:47,800
and Abel story there obviously you know

1709
01:07:43,540 --> 01:07:49,270
I mean it's not quite as clear because

1710
01:07:47,800 --> 01:07:51,790
in the Cain and Abel story Abel is

1711
01:07:49,270 --> 01:07:54,070
clearly just doing well and here you

1712
01:07:51,790 --> 01:07:55,510
can't quite get a handle on Joseph's

1713
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:57,310
character you can't tell if he is

1714
01:07:55,510 --> 01:07:59,260
actually the elect or if he's just a

1715
01:07:57,310 --> 01:08:02,050
spoiled brat with delusions of grandeur

1716
01:07:59,260 --> 01:08:05,380
you know and but it doesn't matter

1717
01:08:02,050 --> 01:08:07,750
because his brothers are so irritated at

1718
01:08:05,380 --> 01:08:10,530
his the fact that he's favored and

1719
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:14,590
perhaps even the fact that he might be

1720
01:08:10,530 --> 01:08:16,839
someone destined for for something

1721
01:08:14,590 --> 01:08:20,140
special that they find it perfectly

1722
01:08:16,839 --> 01:08:24,040
reasonable to destroy that and it's so

1723
01:08:20,140 --> 01:08:26,770
hard so interesting how often that motif

1724
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:28,960
of pulling down an ideal manifests

1725
01:08:26,770 --> 01:08:31,029
itself in these old stories right it's

1726
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:32,770
it's the pattern is established in the

1727
01:08:31,029 --> 01:08:34,600
Cain and Abel story it just repeats and

1728
01:08:32,770 --> 01:08:36,279
repeats and repeats and I think that's

1729
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:38,650
dead true I think it just repeats all

1730
01:08:36,279 --> 01:08:41,109
the time so that people are annoyed

1731
01:08:38,650 --> 01:08:42,940
about how tragic their lives are

1732
01:08:41,109 --> 01:08:44,679
annoyed that they're subject to

1733
01:08:42,940 --> 01:08:46,630
malevolence and they're annoyed that

1734
01:08:44,679 --> 01:08:49,089
they're not doing as well as other

1735
01:08:46,630 --> 01:08:50,949
people are doing and that makes them

1736
01:08:49,089 --> 01:08:51,580
that puts them exactly into this state

1737
01:08:50,949 --> 01:08:54,219
of mind

1738
01:08:51,580 --> 01:08:56,020
now maybe with modern people if you're

1739
01:08:54,219 --> 01:08:57,909
gonna kill someone because you're

1740
01:08:56,020 --> 01:08:59,409
resentful as a modern person you don't

1741
01:08:57,909 --> 01:09:01,540
generally slay them and throw them into

1742
01:08:59,409 --> 01:09:03,850
a pit you know what you do is you just

1743
01:09:01,540 --> 01:09:06,130
kill them slowly over a few decades and

1744
01:09:03,850 --> 01:09:10,719
it isn't obvious to me that that's any

1745
01:09:06,130 --> 01:09:12,880
better so I've seen plenty of married

1746
01:09:10,719 --> 01:09:16,389
couples who were in that situation it's

1747
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:18,310
like it's like yeah well there is this

1748
01:09:16,389 --> 01:09:20,109
mitch hedberg he used to complain about

1749
01:09:18,310 --> 01:09:25,869
turtlenecks hey so it was like being

1750
01:09:20,109 --> 01:09:27,429
strangled by a really weak it's

1751
01:09:25,869 --> 01:09:32,529
probably really politically incorrect

1752
01:09:27,429 --> 01:09:36,009
jokes but it's a funny joke so and then

1753
01:09:32,529 --> 01:09:37,989
you see you see relationships that are

1754
01:09:36,009 --> 01:09:39,580
like that it's like each person has

1755
01:09:37,989 --> 01:09:40,690
their hands around the neck of the other

1756
01:09:39,580 --> 01:09:43,630
person but they don't have enough

1757
01:09:40,690 --> 01:09:45,909
courage to actually to squeeze they just

1758
01:09:43,630 --> 01:09:48,639
put enough pressure on just cut the

1759
01:09:45,909 --> 01:09:51,250
circulation off a tiny bit so the person

1760
01:09:48,639 --> 01:09:56,230
just gets like they die over a 30-year

1761
01:09:51,250 --> 01:09:57,639
period something like that so yeah and

1762
01:09:56,230 --> 01:10:02,830
you all laugh because you know it's true

1763
01:09:57,639 --> 01:10:04,570
that's why and we will say some evil

1764
01:10:02,830 --> 01:10:06,850
beast half devoured him which would be

1765
01:10:04,570 --> 01:10:09,580
true actually it would be the evil beast

1766
01:10:06,850 --> 01:10:11,290
that's inside the brothers and we shall

1767
01:10:09,580 --> 01:10:13,780
see what will become of his dreams

1768
01:10:11,290 --> 01:10:17,560
haha that's a that's interesting too

1769
01:10:13,780 --> 01:10:19,449
because so they want to spite themselves

1770
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:20,920
because maybe Joseph is something

1771
01:10:19,449 --> 01:10:24,580
special and then they want to spite

1772
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:26,290
their father which is probably not the

1773
01:10:24,580 --> 01:10:28,119
wisest idea because they owe him some

1774
01:10:26,290 --> 01:10:29,770
gratitude I mean maybe he's acting like

1775
01:10:28,119 --> 01:10:31,750
a pain in the neck there's some evidence

1776
01:10:29,770 --> 01:10:34,239
for that but this is a little bit harsh

1777
01:10:31,750 --> 01:10:36,400
but they also want to spite God just

1778
01:10:34,239 --> 01:10:39,219
like Cain did because that's what it

1779
01:10:36,400 --> 01:10:41,830
means we shall see what will become of

1780
01:10:39,219 --> 01:10:44,260
his dreams right because then as soon as

1781
01:10:41,830 --> 01:10:46,989
you're in some sense trying to fight

1782
01:10:44,260 --> 01:10:48,760
against the intuition of someone the

1783
01:10:46,989 --> 01:10:50,409
natural intuition of someone you set

1784
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:54,760
yourself up against the structure of

1785
01:10:50,409 --> 01:10:56,860
being itself and so pretty bad

1786
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:58,269
and Ruben heard it and he delivered them

1787
01:10:56,860 --> 01:11:00,219
out of their hands and said no let us

1788
01:10:58,269 --> 01:11:02,500
not kill him and Ruben said unto them

1789
01:11:00,219 --> 01:11:03,849
shed no blood but cast him into this pit

1790
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:05,650
that's in the wilderness

1791
01:11:03,849 --> 01:11:09,460
it's like Rubens the good guy in this

1792
01:11:05,650 --> 01:11:11,500
story yeah and and there's no water in

1793
01:11:09,460 --> 01:11:13,900
the pit by the way inlay no hand upon

1794
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:16,079
him that he might rid him out of their

1795
01:11:13,900 --> 01:11:17,380
hands to deliver him to his father again

1796
01:11:16,079 --> 01:11:20,460
hmm

1797
01:11:17,380 --> 01:11:23,110
so Ruben was actually trying to save him

1798
01:11:20,460 --> 01:11:24,760
said he might rid him out of their hands

1799
01:11:23,110 --> 01:11:27,309
to deliver him to his father again and

1800
01:11:24,760 --> 01:11:28,630
it came to pass when Joseph came unto

1801
01:11:27,309 --> 01:11:31,059
his brethren that they stripped him of

1802
01:11:28,630 --> 01:11:34,210
his coat his coat of many colors that

1803
01:11:31,059 --> 01:11:35,889
was on him and they took him and cast

1804
01:11:34,210 --> 01:11:42,219
him into a pit and the pit was empty and

1805
01:11:35,889 --> 01:11:43,750
there was no water in it and then they

1806
01:11:42,219 --> 01:11:45,010
sat down to eat bread and lifted up

1807
01:11:43,750 --> 01:11:46,840
their eyes and looked and behold a

1808
01:11:45,010 --> 01:11:49,389
company of Ishmaelites come came from

1809
01:11:46,840 --> 01:11:51,460
Gilead with their camels bearing spices

1810
01:11:49,389 --> 01:11:53,079
and balm and myrrh going to carry it

1811
01:11:51,460 --> 01:11:56,079
down to Egypt and Judah said unto his

1812
01:11:53,079 --> 01:11:57,989
brethren how does it profit us if we

1813
01:11:56,079 --> 01:12:01,000
kill our brother and conceal his blood

1814
01:11:57,989 --> 01:12:03,280
so he's the practical guy here's what

1815
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:06,280
why would we kill him when we can sell

1816
01:12:03,280 --> 01:12:08,230
him it's like come let us sell him to

1817
01:12:06,280 --> 01:12:09,760
the Ishmaelites and let not our hand be

1818
01:12:08,230 --> 01:12:13,090
upon him for he is our brother in our

1819
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:15,159
flesh and his brethren were content then

1820
01:12:13,090 --> 01:12:16,960
there passed by Midianites merchantman

1821
01:12:15,159 --> 01:12:18,550
and they drew and lifted up joseph out

1822
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:21,489
of the pit and sold joseph to the

1823
01:12:18,550 --> 01:12:24,519
Ishmaelites for 20 pieces of silver it's

1824
01:12:21,489 --> 01:12:26,349
a amount that echoes through into the

1825
01:12:24,519 --> 01:12:28,179
future and they brought Joseph into

1826
01:12:26,349 --> 01:12:31,059
Egypt I'm never really sure how these

1827
01:12:28,179 --> 01:12:33,849
slavery stories work it's like so it's

1828
01:12:31,059 --> 01:12:34,960
two 2,500 3,000 years ago and I decided

1829
01:12:33,849 --> 01:12:37,329
I'm gonna sell you to the Ishmaelites

1830
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:38,860
and that just works out they I get the

1831
01:12:37,329 --> 01:12:40,599
money you get to be a slave and they

1832
01:12:38,860 --> 01:12:42,099
take you away I don't really understand

1833
01:12:40,599 --> 01:12:43,539
how that works I can't figure out how

1834
01:12:42,099 --> 01:12:44,530
people weren't just selling each other

1835
01:12:43,539 --> 01:12:51,030
all the time

1836
01:12:44,530 --> 01:12:51,030
but maybe if your family you can do it

1837
01:12:52,889 --> 01:12:59,949
so they're they sold him and Reuben

1838
01:12:58,090 --> 01:13:01,900
returned to the pit and behold Joseph

1839
01:12:59,949 --> 01:13:03,610
was not there and Reuben rent his

1840
01:13:01,900 --> 01:13:05,079
clothes so Reubens very upset about this

1841
01:13:03,610 --> 01:13:07,300
and he returned unto his brothers and

1842
01:13:05,079 --> 01:13:08,130
said the child is not and I where shall

1843
01:13:07,300 --> 01:13:10,770
I go

1844
01:13:08,130 --> 01:13:12,990
and they conspired they took Joseph's

1845
01:13:10,770 --> 01:13:14,730
coat and killed a kid of the goats and

1846
01:13:12,990 --> 01:13:16,020
dipped the coat in the blood that's

1847
01:13:14,730 --> 01:13:18,930
interesting too because blood is

1848
01:13:16,020 --> 01:13:21,210
actually another color right so he's got

1849
01:13:18,930 --> 01:13:24,030
this coat of many colors and blood is

1850
01:13:21,210 --> 01:13:26,040
definitely a color and so this is the

1851
01:13:24,030 --> 01:13:28,680
addition in some sense of the color of

1852
01:13:26,040 --> 01:13:32,070
blood to Joseph's coat and I would say

1853
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:33,690
it's probably a necessary color because

1854
01:13:32,070 --> 01:13:35,490
I don't think that you're serious enough

1855
01:13:33,690 --> 01:13:38,670
till your coat has been dipped in blood

1856
01:13:35,490 --> 01:13:40,140
that can happen in many ways and they

1857
01:13:38,670 --> 01:13:43,410
sent the coat of many colors and they

1858
01:13:40,140 --> 01:13:45,390
brought it to their father and said so

1859
01:13:43,410 --> 01:13:48,480
they lied to him it's very very nasty

1860
01:13:45,390 --> 01:13:50,820
business this they they sell his son to

1861
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:53,580
slavery they claim that he's dead they

1862
01:13:50,820 --> 01:13:56,070
lied to him they they put him into an

1863
01:13:53,580 --> 01:13:58,800
extreme state of grief there's a lot of

1864
01:13:56,070 --> 01:14:01,530
hatred underneath that right tremendous

1865
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:05,460
amount of hatred for Joseph and also for

1866
01:14:01,530 --> 01:14:07,890
Jacob this we have found know now

1867
01:14:05,460 --> 01:14:09,660
whether it be thy sons coat or not and

1868
01:14:07,890 --> 01:14:13,110
he knew it he said it's my son's coat

1869
01:14:09,660 --> 01:14:15,390
and evil beast has devoured him Joseph

1870
01:14:13,110 --> 01:14:17,100
is without doubt rent in pieces and

1871
01:14:15,390 --> 01:14:18,990
Jacob tore his clothes and put sackcloth

1872
01:14:17,100 --> 01:14:20,580
on his loins and mourned for many days

1873
01:14:18,990 --> 01:14:22,380
and all his sons and daughters rose up

1874
01:14:20,580 --> 01:14:24,390
to comfort him but he refused to be

1875
01:14:22,380 --> 01:14:28,320
comforted and he said I'll go down unto

1876
01:14:24,390 --> 01:14:34,710
my grave mourning my son does his father

1877
01:14:28,320 --> 01:14:42,030
wept for him so that's Jacob collapsing

1878
01:14:34,710 --> 01:14:44,550
at the news and the Midianites sold

1879
01:14:42,030 --> 01:14:46,320
Joseph into Egypt unto Potiphar an

1880
01:14:44,550 --> 01:14:47,850
officer of Pharaohs and captain of the

1881
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:49,890
guard and Joseph was brought down to

1882
01:14:47,850 --> 01:14:51,240
Egypt and port afar an officer of

1883
01:14:49,890 --> 01:14:53,370
Pharaoh captain of the guard and

1884
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:54,720
Egyptian bought him of the hands of the

1885
01:14:53,370 --> 01:14:59,790
Ishmaelites which had brought him down

1886
01:14:54,720 --> 01:15:02,150
thither so now he's a slave so now you'd

1887
01:14:59,790 --> 01:15:04,740
think well that would be this is a man

1888
01:15:02,150 --> 01:15:07,530
who has a lot of reason to be irritated

1889
01:15:04,740 --> 01:15:09,660
at the structure of reality right he's

1890
01:15:07,530 --> 01:15:11,550
gone from being the favorite to being

1891
01:15:09,660 --> 01:15:14,040
betrayed by all of his brothers that's

1892
01:15:11,550 --> 01:15:15,720
pretty rough and then he's being

1893
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:18,360
transformed into a slave and now he's

1894
01:15:15,720 --> 01:15:20,730
being he's being sold to work as a slave

1895
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:21,900
so you'd think that that would corrupt

1896
01:15:20,730 --> 01:15:23,580
his character because

1897
01:15:21,900 --> 01:15:25,409
you know one of the things I think this

1898
01:15:23,580 --> 01:15:27,030
is the case anyways I think people are

1899
01:15:25,409 --> 01:15:29,159
always looking for an excuse to have

1900
01:15:27,030 --> 01:15:30,810
their character corrupted because if

1901
01:15:29,159 --> 01:15:32,370
your character is corrupted then you get

1902
01:15:30,810 --> 01:15:33,900
to lie and you get to cheat you get to

1903
01:15:32,370 --> 01:15:35,489
steal and you get to betray and you get

1904
01:15:33,900 --> 01:15:38,070
to act resentfully and you get to do

1905
01:15:35,489 --> 01:15:39,449
nothing and that's all easy it's easier

1906
01:15:38,070 --> 01:15:40,739
to lie than to tell the truth it's

1907
01:15:39,449 --> 01:15:42,719
easier to do nothing than to do

1908
01:15:40,739 --> 01:15:45,060
something so there's always part of you

1909
01:15:42,719 --> 01:15:47,040
thinking well I need a justification for

1910
01:15:45,060 --> 01:15:51,540
being useless and horrible because

1911
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:53,790
that'd be a lot less work and so then if

1912
01:15:51,540 --> 01:15:56,190
something terrible comes along you think

1913
01:15:53,790 --> 01:15:58,830
AHA that's just exactly the excuse that

1914
01:15:56,190 --> 01:16:02,580
I was waiting for and then out all that

1915
01:15:58,830 --> 01:16:04,880
comes you know Solzhenitsyn when he was

1916
01:16:02,580 --> 01:16:08,130
in the concentration camps in Russia

1917
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:09,690
watching how people behaved you know he

1918
01:16:08,130 --> 01:16:11,429
said that there were people that were

1919
01:16:09,690 --> 01:16:13,469
put in the camps who immediately became

1920
01:16:11,429 --> 01:16:15,030
trustees or guards and they were even

1921
01:16:13,469 --> 01:16:17,040
more vicious than the people who had

1922
01:16:15,030 --> 01:16:20,969
been hired as guards and his idea was

1923
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:24,120
that they had collected all that he

1924
01:16:20,969 --> 01:16:27,390
called it foul Ness if I remember

1925
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:28,860
correctly around them in normal life but

1926
01:16:27,390 --> 01:16:30,719
they didn't have the opportunity to

1927
01:16:28,860 --> 01:16:32,340
express it but as soon as you gave them

1928
01:16:30,719 --> 01:16:37,770
the opportunity it was like there it was

1929
01:16:32,340 --> 01:16:39,690
right away and so so one of the messages

1930
01:16:37,770 --> 01:16:42,929
that seems to echo through these old

1931
01:16:39,690 --> 01:16:44,400
testament stories is that just because

1932
01:16:42,929 --> 01:16:47,460
something terrible happens to you

1933
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:49,920
doesn't mean that you get to be that you

1934
01:16:47,460 --> 01:16:52,469
get to wander off the path and make

1935
01:16:49,920 --> 01:16:55,050
things worse and maybe it doesn't matter

1936
01:16:52,469 --> 01:16:57,900
how terrible it is that what happens to

1937
01:16:55,050 --> 01:16:59,550
you that's a tough call you know because

1938
01:16:57,900 --> 01:17:02,040
you see people now and then in life who

1939
01:16:59,550 --> 01:17:03,449
they've really got it rough man like 50

1940
01:17:02,040 --> 01:17:05,190
bad things are happening to them at the

1941
01:17:03,449 --> 01:17:06,480
same time and you think oh it's no

1942
01:17:05,190 --> 01:17:09,840
wonder if you were bitter and resentful

1943
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:11,580
and hostile be like yeah no wonder but

1944
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:12,870
then you meet people and Solzhenitsyn

1945
01:17:11,580 --> 01:17:14,250
again talked about this in the Gulag

1946
01:17:12,870 --> 01:17:15,900
Archipelago he said he met lots of

1947
01:17:14,250 --> 01:17:18,480
people in the North Lodz

1948
01:17:15,900 --> 01:17:20,820
he met enough people to impress him in

1949
01:17:18,480 --> 01:17:22,860
the concentration camp system who didn't

1950
01:17:20,820 --> 01:17:25,949
allow their misfortunes to corrupt them

1951
01:17:22,860 --> 01:17:27,719
and that's something because maybe the

1952
01:17:25,949 --> 01:17:30,360
only real misfortune is to become

1953
01:17:27,719 --> 01:17:32,750
corrupted that's a really useful thing

1954
01:17:30,360 --> 01:17:35,100
to think you know maybe the rest of it

1955
01:17:32,750 --> 01:17:35,790
maybe the rest of it is trivial in

1956
01:17:35,100 --> 01:17:37,650
comparison

1957
01:17:35,790 --> 01:17:39,810
I know that's a rough thing because you

1958
01:17:37,650 --> 01:17:41,670
can be in very harsh circumstances but I

1959
01:17:39,810 --> 01:17:43,920
do think there's something to that and

1960
01:17:41,670 --> 01:17:45,360
the Lord was with Joseph and he was a

1961
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:47,160
prosperous man and he was in the house

1962
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:48,780
of his master the Egyptian and his

1963
01:17:47,160 --> 01:17:50,340
master saw that the Lord was with him

1964
01:17:48,780 --> 01:17:52,410
and that Lord made all that he did to

1965
01:17:50,340 --> 01:17:53,670
prosper in his hand so that's an echo of

1966
01:17:52,410 --> 01:17:56,160
the idea that we encountered earlier

1967
01:17:53,670 --> 01:17:58,650
about walking with God right so Adam

1968
01:17:56,160 --> 01:18:00,150
walked with God before he ate the fruit

1969
01:17:58,650 --> 01:18:02,910
with Eve and then he wouldn't walk with

1970
01:18:00,150 --> 01:18:04,770
God and then Noah walked with God and

1971
01:18:02,910 --> 01:18:06,930
Abraham walked with God and so the idea

1972
01:18:04,770 --> 01:18:08,340
is well that's that alignment with the

1973
01:18:06,930 --> 01:18:10,980
highest ideal I think it's something

1974
01:18:08,340 --> 01:18:12,690
like that and you know we could think

1975
01:18:10,980 --> 01:18:16,470
about that as a metaphysical claim as

1976
01:18:12,690 --> 01:18:19,440
well but I don't think it is I mean I've

1977
01:18:16,470 --> 01:18:22,650
got thousands of letters now in the last

1978
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:26,280
year from people who have told me that

1979
01:18:22,650 --> 01:18:28,920
they were in a pit that's exactly right

1980
01:18:26,280 --> 01:18:31,410
and that they decided that they were

1981
01:18:28,920 --> 01:18:36,330
going to try to put their lives together

1982
01:18:31,410 --> 01:18:37,530
and that it worked and so that's really

1983
01:18:36,330 --> 01:18:39,390
something you know when they write

1984
01:18:37,530 --> 01:18:41,340
surprised it's like well I decided that

1985
01:18:39,390 --> 01:18:43,140
I was gonna work hard at what I was

1986
01:18:41,340 --> 01:18:44,970
doing and I wasn't gonna lie any more

1987
01:18:43,140 --> 01:18:46,890
than absolutely necessary I thought I'd

1988
01:18:44,970 --> 01:18:48,960
give it a try for a few months you know

1989
01:18:46,890 --> 01:18:51,510
and all sorts of good things started to

1990
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:53,730
happen to me it's like maybe that's how

1991
01:18:51,510 --> 01:18:55,410
the world works now obviously it doesn't

1992
01:18:53,730 --> 01:18:57,120
work like that all the time right

1993
01:18:55,410 --> 01:18:58,860
because you can get sliced off at the

1994
01:18:57,120 --> 01:19:01,530
knees I mean there's an arbitrary

1995
01:18:58,860 --> 01:19:04,940
element to existence that that you can't

1996
01:19:01,530 --> 01:19:08,940
wish away but that doesn't mean that

1997
01:19:04,940 --> 01:19:10,350
there are it doesn't mean that there

1998
01:19:08,940 --> 01:19:14,520
aren't bad strategies and good

1999
01:19:10,350 --> 01:19:15,600
strategies and so I do think that one of

2000
01:19:14,520 --> 01:19:18,330
the most fundamental existential

2001
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:20,310
questions is like if things aren't going

2002
01:19:18,330 --> 01:19:21,630
well for you and your life is are you

2003
01:19:20,310 --> 01:19:23,580
absolutely certain that you're doing

2004
01:19:21,630 --> 01:19:25,410
absolutely everything you can to put

2005
01:19:23,580 --> 01:19:27,480
things in order because if you're not

2006
01:19:25,410 --> 01:19:28,950
then you shouldn't complain because you

2007
01:19:27,480 --> 01:19:31,650
don't know to what degree you're

2008
01:19:28,950 --> 01:19:33,300
actually contributing or even causing

2009
01:19:31,650 --> 01:19:34,830
the circumstance now that's a very

2010
01:19:33,300 --> 01:19:36,210
annoying thing to think and I'm not

2011
01:19:34,830 --> 01:19:37,740
trying to blame the victim

2012
01:19:36,210 --> 01:19:39,420
you know I know that people end up with

2013
01:19:37,740 --> 01:19:41,640
lung cancer because they were exposed to

2014
01:19:39,420 --> 01:19:43,740
asbestos you know and I'm not trying to

2015
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:45,180
although I also know too that if you

2016
01:19:43,740 --> 01:19:47,100
have lung cancer because you've been

2017
01:19:45,180 --> 01:19:49,050
exposed to asbestos that can be a

2018
01:19:47,100 --> 01:19:49,290
tragedy or it can be hell and to some

2019
01:19:49,050 --> 01:19:51,060
degree

2020
01:19:49,290 --> 01:19:53,730
that depends on how you conduct yourself

2021
01:19:51,060 --> 01:19:57,720
so I mean I know that's pretty gloomy

2022
01:19:53,730 --> 01:19:59,930
possibilities right but so anyway so

2023
01:19:57,720 --> 01:20:03,570
Joseph is a slave but it turns out that

2024
01:19:59,930 --> 01:20:04,980
he's uh he hasn't sacrificed the

2025
01:20:03,570 --> 01:20:07,320
integrity of his character and so it

2026
01:20:04,980 --> 01:20:09,900
turns out that being it turns out that

2027
01:20:07,320 --> 01:20:11,880
he's not a slave it's just that everyone

2028
01:20:09,900 --> 01:20:16,170
around him thinks he's a slave but he's

2029
01:20:11,880 --> 01:20:18,090
not so that's pretty interesting he was

2030
01:20:16,170 --> 01:20:20,730
a goodly person and well favored well so

2031
01:20:18,090 --> 01:20:23,880
he's a good guy and he's an impressive

2032
01:20:20,730 --> 01:20:25,530
specimen as well this is pretty

2033
01:20:23,880 --> 01:20:27,990
interesting given the current political

2034
01:20:25,530 --> 01:20:29,910
climate I would say and it came to pass

2035
01:20:27,990 --> 01:20:32,130
after these things that his master's

2036
01:20:29,910 --> 01:20:35,250
wife cast her eyes upon Joseph and she

2037
01:20:32,130 --> 01:20:38,460
said lie with me that means that

2038
01:20:35,250 --> 01:20:45,060
actually has two meanings right but he

2039
01:20:38,460 --> 01:20:49,020
refused and said unto his master's wife

2040
01:20:45,060 --> 01:20:50,870
behold my master does not know what's

2041
01:20:49,020 --> 01:20:55,140
with me in the house and he's committed

2042
01:20:50,870 --> 01:20:58,200
all that he has to my hand there's no

2043
01:20:55,140 --> 01:21:00,090
one greater in this house than I neither

2044
01:20:58,200 --> 01:21:02,970
hath he kept back anything for me but

2045
01:21:00,090 --> 01:21:04,550
you because you are his wife how then

2046
01:21:02,970 --> 01:21:10,320
can I do this great wickedness

2047
01:21:04,550 --> 01:21:12,180
wickedness and sin against God and it

2048
01:21:10,320 --> 01:21:14,160
came to pass as she spake to Joseph day

2049
01:21:12,180 --> 01:21:16,680
by day that he hearkened not unto her to

2050
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:19,590
lie by her or be with her it's being

2051
01:21:16,680 --> 01:21:22,770
sexually harassed Joseph and it came to

2052
01:21:19,590 --> 01:21:31,530
pass well its rounds right I mean look

2053
01:21:22,770 --> 01:21:33,210
look at the painting and it came to pass

2054
01:21:31,530 --> 01:21:34,770
about this time that Joseph went into

2055
01:21:33,210 --> 01:21:36,150
the house to do his business and there

2056
01:21:34,770 --> 01:21:38,640
was none of the men of the house there

2057
01:21:36,150 --> 01:21:41,370
with in and she caught him by his

2058
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:43,530
garment saying lie with me and he left

2059
01:21:41,370 --> 01:21:46,050
his garment in her hand and fled and got

2060
01:21:43,530 --> 01:21:48,060
him out so that's so kind of

2061
01:21:46,050 --> 01:21:51,450
embarrassing for poor Joseph I would say

2062
01:21:48,060 --> 01:21:53,130
and a bit on the suspicious side and it

2063
01:21:51,450 --> 01:21:54,900
came to pass when she saw that he had

2064
01:21:53,130 --> 01:21:57,360
left his garment in her hand and was

2065
01:21:54,900 --> 01:21:59,700
fled forth that she called unto the men

2066
01:21:57,360 --> 01:22:01,560
of her house and spake unto them see see

2067
01:21:59,700 --> 01:22:02,790
he hath brought in a Hebrew to mark us

2068
01:22:01,560 --> 01:22:04,830
he came in unto

2069
01:22:02,790 --> 01:22:09,000
you lie with me and I cried with a loud

2070
01:22:04,830 --> 01:22:12,050
voice so what is it hell hath no fury

2071
01:22:09,000 --> 01:22:14,580
like a woman scorned that's the proper

2072
01:22:12,050 --> 01:22:16,230
commentary on that and it came to pass

2073
01:22:14,580 --> 01:22:17,910
when he heard that I lifted up my voice

2074
01:22:16,230 --> 01:22:21,150
and cried that he left his garment with

2075
01:22:17,910 --> 01:22:22,950
me and fled and got himself out and it

2076
01:22:21,150 --> 01:22:24,450
came to pass when his master heard the

2077
01:22:22,950 --> 01:22:26,820
words of his wife so that's the farro

2078
01:22:24,450 --> 01:22:29,430
which she spake unto him saying after

2079
01:22:26,820 --> 01:22:31,380
this manner did thy servant to me his

2080
01:22:29,430 --> 01:22:33,420
wrath was kindled and joseph's master

2081
01:22:31,380 --> 01:22:35,430
took him and put him in prison a place

2082
01:22:33,420 --> 01:22:37,320
where the Kings prisoners were was were

2083
01:22:35,430 --> 01:22:41,130
bound and he was there in the prison

2084
01:22:37,320 --> 01:22:43,230
well that sort of sucks it's like first

2085
01:22:41,130 --> 01:22:45,540
his brothers betray him and throw him in

2086
01:22:43,230 --> 01:22:46,980
a pit and then he gets made a slave

2087
01:22:45,540 --> 01:22:49,020
which is probably better than being in

2088
01:22:46,980 --> 01:22:50,850
the pit and then he becomes sort of like

2089
01:22:49,020 --> 01:22:52,980
King slaves so that's working out pretty

2090
01:22:50,850 --> 01:22:54,480
well and now someone lies about him he

2091
01:22:52,980 --> 01:22:55,890
gets betrayed again and now it's into

2092
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:57,960
the prison with him and so it's this

2093
01:22:55,890 --> 01:23:01,290
it's this again right it's the same

2094
01:22:57,960 --> 01:23:04,550
thing it's Sisyphus up with the rock and

2095
01:23:01,290 --> 01:23:07,260
then down and it's order chaos order

2096
01:23:04,550 --> 01:23:09,180
chaos and then you have to think well

2097
01:23:07,260 --> 01:23:11,120
are you the order or you the chaos or

2098
01:23:09,180 --> 01:23:13,490
you the thing that's moving between them

2099
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:15,840
because that's the right thing to be

2100
01:23:13,490 --> 01:23:17,580
because otherwise you're just order and

2101
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:19,830
that's a really bad idea or you're just

2102
01:23:17,580 --> 01:23:21,890
chaos and that's a really bad idea you

2103
01:23:19,830 --> 01:23:24,600
can be the thing that's dynamically

2104
01:23:21,890 --> 01:23:27,510
mediating between them and that's what

2105
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:29,460
he's doing but the Lord was with Joseph

2106
01:23:27,510 --> 01:23:31,190
and showed him mercy and gave him favor

2107
01:23:29,460 --> 01:23:34,020
in the sight of the keeper of the prison

2108
01:23:31,190 --> 01:23:35,520
that's no easy thing to do I would think

2109
01:23:34,020 --> 01:23:38,430
you know it's like you're thrown in

2110
01:23:35,520 --> 01:23:40,040
prison and now the jailer likes you now

2111
01:23:38,430 --> 01:23:42,300
how exactly are you going to manage that

2112
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:44,040
it's a good thing to think about because

2113
01:23:42,300 --> 01:23:45,810
you might think well if you were really

2114
01:23:44,040 --> 01:23:47,760
in dire straits how is it that you

2115
01:23:45,810 --> 01:23:49,950
should conduct yourself so that you have

2116
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:52,920
the highest probability of having things

2117
01:23:49,950 --> 01:23:55,200
work out and it's not saying well Joseph

2118
01:23:52,920 --> 01:23:56,670
took over the thumbscrew you know and

2119
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:58,830
started using that on the other

2120
01:23:56,670 --> 01:24:00,180
prisoners that that's not the indication

2121
01:23:58,830 --> 01:24:03,540
here at all it's that he's doing

2122
01:24:00,180 --> 01:24:06,150
something he's acting like a person who

2123
01:24:03,540 --> 01:24:07,620
isn't a prisoner even though he's in the

2124
01:24:06,150 --> 01:24:09,060
prison just like he was acting like

2125
01:24:07,620 --> 01:24:12,740
someone who wasn't a slave when he was a

2126
01:24:09,060 --> 01:24:12,740
slave and so

2127
01:24:15,340 --> 01:24:20,300
it makes you wonder who you can be

2128
01:24:18,099 --> 01:24:22,429
despite the fact that other people think

2129
01:24:20,300 --> 01:24:24,800
that you're whatever you appear to be

2130
01:24:22,429 --> 01:24:26,869
and the keeper of the prison committed

2131
01:24:24,800 --> 01:24:28,519
to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that

2132
01:24:26,869 --> 01:24:30,469
were in the prison and whatsoever they

2133
01:24:28,519 --> 01:24:31,820
did there he was the doer of it the

2134
01:24:30,469 --> 01:24:33,499
keeper of the prison looked not to

2135
01:24:31,820 --> 01:24:34,969
anything that was under his hand because

2136
01:24:33,499 --> 01:24:40,010
the Lord was with him and that which he

2137
01:24:34,969 --> 01:24:42,650
did the Lord made it to prosper so it's

2138
01:24:40,010 --> 01:24:45,229
a repeat its a repeat of exactly what

2139
01:24:42,650 --> 01:24:47,570
happened when he was the slave of the

2140
01:24:45,229 --> 01:24:49,429
Pharaoh except it's one rung deeper into

2141
01:24:47,570 --> 01:24:51,619
hell so to speak right so it's slave

2142
01:24:49,429 --> 01:24:53,900
Pharaoh and here it's prisoner jail

2143
01:24:51,619 --> 01:24:55,639
master but it doesn't matter the same

2144
01:24:53,900 --> 01:24:57,619
thing happens so now Joseph is

2145
01:24:55,639 --> 01:25:00,079
imprisonment the Pharaoh has a fit one

2146
01:24:57,619 --> 01:25:01,820
day of peak and throws the chief of his

2147
01:25:00,079 --> 01:25:04,190
Butler's into prison and the chief of

2148
01:25:01,820 --> 01:25:08,479
his Baker's and they have a dream

2149
01:25:04,190 --> 01:25:10,760
each of them and Joseph interprets the

2150
01:25:08,479 --> 01:25:15,110
dreams seems to be something that he can

2151
01:25:10,760 --> 01:25:18,499
do and he tells the butler that his

2152
01:25:15,110 --> 01:25:19,760
dream means that the Pharaoh was going

2153
01:25:18,499 --> 01:25:22,309
to forgive him and put him back in his

2154
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:24,409
position and he tells the baker that the

2155
01:25:22,309 --> 01:25:26,449
Pharaoh isn't going to forgive him and

2156
01:25:24,409 --> 01:25:29,179
that he's going to take off his head and

2157
01:25:26,449 --> 01:25:31,219
hang him in a tree which was rather

2158
01:25:29,179 --> 01:25:33,920
rough dream but that is what huh that's

2159
01:25:31,219 --> 01:25:35,960
what happens so anyways that the Baker

2160
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:37,699
or the butler goes free and Joseph says

2161
01:25:35,960 --> 01:25:41,030
look you know maybe you could just keep

2162
01:25:37,699 --> 01:25:42,650
in mind the fact that I did you a bit of

2163
01:25:41,030 --> 01:25:45,499
a favor here and told you something that

2164
01:25:42,650 --> 01:25:48,849
was accurate but the chief didn't really

2165
01:25:45,499 --> 01:25:55,789
remember once he once he was freed

2166
01:25:48,849 --> 01:25:58,729
interpreting dreams in prison and so now

2167
01:25:55,789 --> 01:26:00,229
the Pharaoh has a dream and he actually

2168
01:25:58,729 --> 01:26:03,110
has two dreams so it's another one of

2169
01:26:00,229 --> 01:26:04,789
those doubled motifs so the ideas these

2170
01:26:03,110 --> 01:26:07,969
are really important dreams because they

2171
01:26:04,789 --> 01:26:10,729
came in a pair and behold there came out

2172
01:26:07,969 --> 01:26:14,119
of the river seven well-favored kind and

2173
01:26:10,729 --> 01:26:14,300
fat flesh so cattle and they fed the men

2174
01:26:14,119 --> 01:26:17,119
Oh

2175
01:26:14,300 --> 01:26:19,239
meadow and behold seven other cattle

2176
01:26:17,119 --> 01:26:22,130
came up after the Mount of the river

2177
01:26:19,239 --> 01:26:24,650
ill-favored and lean fleshed starving

2178
01:26:22,130 --> 01:26:26,690
and stood by the other cows on the brink

2179
01:26:24,650 --> 01:26:27,740
of the river and the ill-favored and

2180
01:26:26,690 --> 01:26:30,890
lean flesh

2181
01:26:27,740 --> 01:26:34,340
I did eat up the seven well-favored and

2182
01:26:30,890 --> 01:26:37,280
fat so Pharaoh awoke hey fair enough

2183
01:26:34,340 --> 01:26:41,060
it's pretty nasty dream and then he has

2184
01:26:37,280 --> 01:26:42,680
another dream to hit it home and he

2185
01:26:41,060 --> 01:26:45,050
slept and dreamt the second time and

2186
01:26:42,680 --> 01:26:48,020
behold seven years of corn came up upon

2187
01:26:45,050 --> 01:26:50,390
one stalk rankin good and behold seven

2188
01:26:48,020 --> 01:26:52,670
thin ears and blasted with the east wind

2189
01:26:50,390 --> 01:26:54,650
sprung up after them and the seven thin

2190
01:26:52,670 --> 01:26:57,080
ears devoured the seven rank and full

2191
01:26:54,650 --> 01:26:59,600
ears and Pharaoh awoke and beheld it was

2192
01:26:57,080 --> 01:27:01,940
a dream and then it says a little later

2193
01:26:59,600 --> 01:27:03,800
and for that the dream was doubled unto

2194
01:27:01,940 --> 01:27:05,780
Pharaoh twice it is because the thing is

2195
01:27:03,800 --> 01:27:07,820
established by God and God will shortly

2196
01:27:05,780 --> 01:27:09,890
bring it to pass it's interesting you

2197
01:27:07,820 --> 01:27:12,530
know because one of the better theories

2198
01:27:09,890 --> 01:27:14,030
about dreams is that they're part of the

2199
01:27:12,530 --> 01:27:16,040
way that the right and left hemisphere

2200
01:27:14,030 --> 01:27:17,390
communicate or maybe the nonverbal part

2201
01:27:16,040 --> 01:27:19,130
of the brain communicates with the

2202
01:27:17,390 --> 01:27:23,690
verbal brand verbal part of the brain

2203
01:27:19,130 --> 01:27:26,030
and so the nonverbal part of the brain

2204
01:27:23,690 --> 01:27:27,740
which is less differentiated and thinks

2205
01:27:26,030 --> 01:27:30,830
more globally is looking for patterns

2206
01:27:27,740 --> 01:27:33,410
and anomalies in the world things that

2207
01:27:30,830 --> 01:27:35,330
don't fit well with the current way of

2208
01:27:33,410 --> 01:27:37,550
conceptualizing the world things that

2209
01:27:35,330 --> 01:27:39,080
make you anxious and uncertain and those

2210
01:27:37,550 --> 01:27:40,870
are things you haven't mastered right so

2211
01:27:39,080 --> 01:27:42,680
they don't fit well into your

2212
01:27:40,870 --> 01:27:44,900
conceptualization of the world by

2213
01:27:42,680 --> 01:27:45,890
definition because if you had mastered

2214
01:27:44,900 --> 01:27:49,160
them they wouldn't make you anxious

2215
01:27:45,890 --> 01:27:50,600
nervous and so the the nonverbal parts

2216
01:27:49,160 --> 01:27:52,160
of your brain are like an alarm system

2217
01:27:50,600 --> 01:27:55,310
they're looking around for places where

2218
01:27:52,160 --> 01:27:57,620
you're probably wrong and then they put

2219
01:27:55,310 --> 01:28:00,440
those in images and try to conceptualize

2220
01:27:57,620 --> 01:28:02,180
them so that you can update your model

2221
01:28:00,440 --> 01:28:03,650
of reality to take them into account but

2222
01:28:02,180 --> 01:28:06,620
that also produces a fair bit of

2223
01:28:03,650 --> 01:28:12,500
negative emotion especially at night and

2224
01:28:06,620 --> 01:28:14,030
so so we know that we know if you

2225
01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:16,480
deprive people of dreams that they go

2226
01:28:14,030 --> 01:28:19,520
insane very rapidly animals as well

2227
01:28:16,480 --> 01:28:21,140
necessary part of mental equilibrium the

2228
01:28:19,520 --> 01:28:23,210
way you do that with rats in case you

2229
01:28:21,140 --> 01:28:24,560
want to know is that you've got rats

2230
01:28:23,210 --> 01:28:25,280
that you want to drive insane this is

2231
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:29,060
how you do it

2232
01:28:25,280 --> 01:28:31,160
so you put the rat on a like a pedestal

2233
01:28:29,060 --> 01:28:33,350
that's pretty small and then when you

2234
01:28:31,160 --> 01:28:35,510
fall it's surrounded by water and then

2235
01:28:33,350 --> 01:28:37,130
when he falls asleep his nose hits the

2236
01:28:35,510 --> 01:28:39,170
water then he wakes up and so you can

2237
01:28:37,130 --> 01:28:41,599
deprive the rat of sleep and that

2238
01:28:39,170 --> 01:28:44,469
doesn't the rats don't respond to

2239
01:28:41,599 --> 01:28:47,170
very well after some period of time so

2240
01:28:44,469 --> 01:28:49,790
that's one of the ways that that's been

2241
01:28:47,170 --> 01:28:52,400
discovered but anyways the dream does

2242
01:28:49,790 --> 01:28:54,739
seem to be an update mechanism and so if

2243
01:28:52,400 --> 01:28:56,719
if you have a very powerful dream like a

2244
01:28:54,739 --> 01:28:58,219
nightmare especially if it's repeating

2245
01:28:56,719 --> 01:29:01,060
it's like something is trying to hammer

2246
01:28:58,219 --> 01:29:02,989
on the door that needs to be let in and

2247
01:29:01,060 --> 01:29:07,340
often you don't know how to let it in

2248
01:29:02,989 --> 01:29:09,170
that's that's a problem so but then

2249
01:29:07,340 --> 01:29:12,110
Pharaoh sent and called Joseph because

2250
01:29:09,170 --> 01:29:13,400
he had talked to his his Butler and they

2251
01:29:12,110 --> 01:29:15,079
brought him hastily out of the dungeon

2252
01:29:13,400 --> 01:29:18,010
and Joseph shaved himself and changed

2253
01:29:15,079 --> 01:29:20,270
his clothes and came in unto Pharaoh I

2254
01:29:18,010 --> 01:29:21,829
guess he didn't want a shark Pharaoh

2255
01:29:20,270 --> 01:29:23,929
with how people dressed in the prison

2256
01:29:21,829 --> 01:29:25,310
and Pharaoh said unto Joseph I've

2257
01:29:23,929 --> 01:29:26,960
dreamed a dream and there's none that

2258
01:29:25,310 --> 01:29:28,400
can interpret it I've heard say of thee

2259
01:29:26,960 --> 01:29:30,909
that you could understand a dream to

2260
01:29:28,400 --> 01:29:34,280
interpret it and Joseph said it's not me

2261
01:29:30,909 --> 01:29:37,040
God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace

2262
01:29:34,280 --> 01:29:39,469
it's so Jacob isn't taking credit for

2263
01:29:37,040 --> 01:29:40,810
his ability to interpret dreams which

2264
01:29:39,469 --> 01:29:44,030
also indicates quite interestingly

2265
01:29:40,810 --> 01:29:45,800
there's there's nothing that despite the

2266
01:29:44,030 --> 01:29:48,320
fact that he's successful incompetent

2267
01:29:45,800 --> 01:29:50,900
he's not narcissistic like if he happens

2268
01:29:48,320 --> 01:29:52,699
to have this gift he regards it as a

2269
01:29:50,900 --> 01:29:54,889
gift and not as something that you know

2270
01:29:52,699 --> 01:29:56,900
renounced his favor it's just something

2271
01:29:54,889 --> 01:29:58,610
that he happens to be able to do and so

2272
01:29:56,900 --> 01:30:00,440
that's that's a hallmark of someone

2273
01:29:58,610 --> 01:30:02,210
who's got a pretty well put-together

2274
01:30:00,440 --> 01:30:06,469
personality as far as I'm concerned

2275
01:30:02,210 --> 01:30:08,060
because you know people have gifts that

2276
01:30:06,469 --> 01:30:10,280
they didn't really earn those would be

2277
01:30:08,060 --> 01:30:11,810
your talents your intelligence your good

2278
01:30:10,280 --> 01:30:15,440
looks if you happen to have good looks

2279
01:30:11,810 --> 01:30:17,119
etc and they're not there's no sense

2280
01:30:15,440 --> 01:30:19,250
being all puffed up about that because

2281
01:30:17,119 --> 01:30:22,040
it's it's great it's luck of the draw

2282
01:30:19,250 --> 01:30:23,480
though and the proper attitude is to

2283
01:30:22,040 --> 01:30:31,489
note that it's luck of the draw to be

2284
01:30:23,480 --> 01:30:37,190
grateful for it it's quite a fine

2285
01:30:31,489 --> 01:30:38,719
painting that one behold there come

2286
01:30:37,190 --> 01:30:40,429
seven years of great plenty throughout

2287
01:30:38,719 --> 01:30:42,199
the island of Egypt and then there shall

2288
01:30:40,429 --> 01:30:43,579
arise after them seven years of famine

2289
01:30:42,199 --> 01:30:45,170
and all the plenty shall be forgotten

2290
01:30:43,579 --> 01:30:47,510
and the famine shall consume the land

2291
01:30:45,170 --> 01:30:49,880
and the Plenty shall not be known in the

2292
01:30:47,510 --> 01:30:54,320
land by reason of that famine following

2293
01:30:49,880 --> 01:30:55,309
issue for it shall be very Grievous so

2294
01:30:54,320 --> 01:30:57,109
now we

2295
01:30:55,309 --> 01:30:58,879
to that Jacob he can interpret dreams

2296
01:30:57,109 --> 01:31:01,010
but he's also the sort of person who can

2297
01:30:58,879 --> 01:31:03,439
look into the future and think this is

2298
01:31:01,010 --> 01:31:05,629
sort of what Adam was called on to do

2299
01:31:03,439 --> 01:31:07,399
when he got kicked out of the garden of

2300
01:31:05,629 --> 01:31:09,289
paradise is you're going to be able to

2301
01:31:07,399 --> 01:31:11,599
conceptualize that even if things are

2302
01:31:09,289 --> 01:31:12,829
going well now that that doesn't mean

2303
01:31:11,599 --> 01:31:16,099
that they're going to go well into the

2304
01:31:12,829 --> 01:31:18,109
future and so he's the aunt and not the

2305
01:31:16,099 --> 01:31:19,609
grasshopper right in the grasshopper and

2306
01:31:18,109 --> 01:31:22,010
the ant story it's like everything's

2307
01:31:19,609 --> 01:31:24,169
good but you should wake the hell up and

2308
01:31:22,010 --> 01:31:26,239
you should test to see how things can go

2309
01:31:24,169 --> 01:31:30,039
wrong and you can see if your systems

2310
01:31:26,239 --> 01:31:32,809
can survive them things going wrong and

2311
01:31:30,039 --> 01:31:34,550
which is something that I think we could

2312
01:31:32,809 --> 01:31:36,289
all hearken to because I think we do a

2313
01:31:34,550 --> 01:31:37,939
very bad job in the modern world of

2314
01:31:36,289 --> 01:31:43,760
testing to see if our systems can go

2315
01:31:37,939 --> 01:31:45,439
wrong okay so the Pharaoh was pretty

2316
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:46,760
impressed by this dream interpretation

2317
01:31:45,439 --> 01:31:48,379
and pretty worried about it and I guess

2318
01:31:46,760 --> 01:31:50,929
he's a reasonable person despite the

2319
01:31:48,379 --> 01:31:53,689
fact that he put Joseph in jail I guess

2320
01:31:50,929 --> 01:31:56,149
he didn't have much choice now therefore

2321
01:31:53,689 --> 01:31:58,129
let Pharaoh look for a man dis discreet

2322
01:31:56,149 --> 01:32:00,229
and wise and set him over the land of

2323
01:31:58,129 --> 01:32:01,909
Egypt let Pharaoh do this and let him

2324
01:32:00,229 --> 01:32:03,949
appoint officers over the land this is

2325
01:32:01,909 --> 01:32:06,469
what Joseph is saying and take up the

2326
01:32:03,949 --> 01:32:11,239
fifth part of the land of Egypt in the

2327
01:32:06,469 --> 01:32:12,439
seven plenteous years and let them

2328
01:32:11,239 --> 01:32:14,119
gather all the food of those good years

2329
01:32:12,439 --> 01:32:15,979
that come and lay up corn under the hand

2330
01:32:14,119 --> 01:32:20,179
of Pharaoh and let them keep food in the

2331
01:32:15,979 --> 01:32:24,649
cities and just like that Joseph is

2332
01:32:20,179 --> 01:32:26,269
restored to his position so Pharaoh said

2333
01:32:24,649 --> 01:32:28,129
unto Joseph I am Pharaoh and without

2334
01:32:26,269 --> 01:32:30,109
thee shall no man lift up his hand or

2335
01:32:28,129 --> 01:32:34,519
foot in all of the land of Egypt and so

2336
01:32:30,109 --> 01:32:37,280
he comes out of the prison and he really

2337
01:32:34,519 --> 01:32:38,719
in some sense as far as I'm concerned he

2338
01:32:37,280 --> 01:32:40,280
actually occupies a position that's

2339
01:32:38,719 --> 01:32:41,749
higher than the position of the Pharaoh

2340
01:32:40,280 --> 01:32:43,399
depends on how you look at it because

2341
01:32:41,749 --> 01:32:46,429
the Pharaoh has relegated himself to

2342
01:32:43,399 --> 01:32:47,780
ceremonial status right Joseph has all

2343
01:32:46,429 --> 01:32:50,739
the responsibilities makes all the

2344
01:32:47,780 --> 01:32:53,269
decisions so de-facto he's the pharaoh

2345
01:32:50,739 --> 01:32:54,679
he doesn't get the glory precisely

2346
01:32:53,269 --> 01:32:56,959
although he's not doing too bad for

2347
01:32:54,679 --> 01:33:00,559
himself not there's a lesson in that too

2348
01:32:56,959 --> 01:33:02,809
I wrote these rules for Quora a long

2349
01:33:00,559 --> 01:33:04,399
time ago and one of them I've written

2350
01:33:02,809 --> 01:33:06,169
them into this some of them into this

2351
01:33:04,399 --> 01:33:07,760
book you guys got a pamphlet about today

2352
01:33:06,169 --> 01:33:09,020
one of the rules that I didn't write

2353
01:33:07,760 --> 01:33:12,140
about was

2354
01:33:09,020 --> 01:33:14,180
um note that responsive note that

2355
01:33:12,140 --> 01:33:16,610
opportunity lurks where responsibility

2356
01:33:14,180 --> 01:33:18,890
has been abdicated which is really

2357
01:33:16,610 --> 01:33:20,720
interesting I think I mean I've seen

2358
01:33:18,890 --> 01:33:22,550
people in their jobs they say things

2359
01:33:20,720 --> 01:33:25,490
like well my the guy I work with doesn't

2360
01:33:22,550 --> 01:33:27,800
do any work it's like well you could do

2361
01:33:25,490 --> 01:33:30,050
it I mean I know there's limits to that

2362
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:32,330
but one of the things you can do at work

2363
01:33:30,050 --> 01:33:34,850
is make yourself indispensable I mean

2364
01:33:32,330 --> 01:33:36,980
you might get the cane types against you

2365
01:33:34,850 --> 01:33:38,690
if you do that but there's something to

2366
01:33:36,980 --> 01:33:41,390
be said for being indispensable because

2367
01:33:38,690 --> 01:33:43,580
when people start to be dispensed with

2368
01:33:41,390 --> 01:33:45,590
you probably won't be one of them or

2369
01:33:43,580 --> 01:33:47,030
even if you are then the fact that

2370
01:33:45,590 --> 01:33:48,350
you're indispensable just means you can

2371
01:33:47,030 --> 01:33:53,120
go somewhere else and be indispensable

2372
01:33:48,350 --> 01:33:56,510
there and that's just as useful so it's

2373
01:33:53,120 --> 01:33:59,000
very very difficult to permanently put

2374
01:33:56,510 --> 01:34:01,160
down someone who's really good at doing

2375
01:33:59,000 --> 01:34:03,320
things because they can just go off and

2376
01:34:01,160 --> 01:34:05,680
do them somewhere else and one of the

2377
01:34:03,320 --> 01:34:08,300
ways that you get like that is to take

2378
01:34:05,680 --> 01:34:10,340
responsibility when someone else is

2379
01:34:08,300 --> 01:34:11,900
failing to do so and you think well I

2380
01:34:10,340 --> 01:34:13,370
shouldn't have to do that that's one way

2381
01:34:11,900 --> 01:34:15,230
of thinking about it another way of

2382
01:34:13,370 --> 01:34:19,460
thinking about it is oh good I get to do

2383
01:34:15,230 --> 01:34:21,230
that and the seven years of plenty estas

2384
01:34:19,460 --> 01:34:22,760
that was in the land of Egypt were ended

2385
01:34:21,230 --> 01:34:26,440
and the seven years of dearth began to

2386
01:34:22,760 --> 01:34:29,650
come according as joseph has said and

2387
01:34:26,440 --> 01:34:33,110
the dearth was in all the lands well

2388
01:34:29,650 --> 01:34:34,730
that's an archetypal story right in the

2389
01:34:33,110 --> 01:34:37,580
archetypal story it's the business cycle

2390
01:34:34,730 --> 01:34:39,410
story it's a little harsher when you're

2391
01:34:37,580 --> 01:34:42,110
starving obviously but that's not the

2392
01:34:39,410 --> 01:34:43,340
point the point is is that sometimes

2393
01:34:42,110 --> 01:34:46,370
things are getting good and sometimes

2394
01:34:43,340 --> 01:34:48,110
things are getting bad and that's you

2395
01:34:46,370 --> 01:34:50,420
can be sure that that's the case that's

2396
01:34:48,110 --> 01:34:53,690
gonna happen to you and so the wise

2397
01:34:50,420 --> 01:34:55,850
person takes stock of the fact that

2398
01:34:53,690 --> 01:34:57,740
things are going to get bad is this is

2399
01:34:55,850 --> 01:35:00,920
the same thing that happens with Noah

2400
01:34:57,740 --> 01:35:03,080
it's like assume the flood cuz it's

2401
01:35:00,920 --> 01:35:04,550
gonna happen and you think well it's a

2402
01:35:03,080 --> 01:35:08,270
hell of a world that has floods it's

2403
01:35:04,550 --> 01:35:09,830
like not if you have a boat right it it

2404
01:35:08,270 --> 01:35:11,450
helps a lot if you if there's a flood

2405
01:35:09,830 --> 01:35:13,430
and you have a boat it's like you can

2406
01:35:11,450 --> 01:35:18,470
float on the flood and then it's not

2407
01:35:13,430 --> 01:35:21,470
such a problem and so if you refuse to

2408
01:35:18,470 --> 01:35:23,519
look not the fact that things are going

2409
01:35:21,470 --> 01:35:25,530
to be going downhill bad

2410
01:35:23,519 --> 01:35:27,869
and that you're going to be in a pit at

2411
01:35:25,530 --> 01:35:31,559
some point you and your family perhaps

2412
01:35:27,869 --> 01:35:34,460
then when it happens it will be as bad

2413
01:35:31,559 --> 01:35:38,150
as it possibly can be but if you're

2414
01:35:34,460 --> 01:35:44,670
awake and alert to that possibility then

2415
01:35:38,150 --> 01:35:45,960
you can mitigate it and the dearth was

2416
01:35:44,670 --> 01:35:49,079
in all the lands but in the land of

2417
01:35:45,960 --> 01:35:50,699
Egypt there was bread and when the land

2418
01:35:49,079 --> 01:35:52,409
of Egypt was famished the people cried

2419
01:35:50,699 --> 01:35:54,960
to Pharaoh for bread and Pharaoh said

2420
01:35:52,409 --> 01:35:57,780
unto the Egyptians go to Joseph what he

2421
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:59,130
says to you to do you do that and the

2422
01:35:57,780 --> 01:36:00,989
famine was all over the face of the

2423
01:35:59,130 --> 01:36:02,849
earth and Joe Joseph opened up the

2424
01:36:00,989 --> 01:36:05,429
storehouses and sold to the Egyptians

2425
01:36:02,849 --> 01:36:06,989
and the famine waxed sore in the land of

2426
01:36:05,429 --> 01:36:10,679
Egypt and all the countries came into

2427
01:36:06,989 --> 01:36:12,929
Egypt to buy to Joseph to buy corn

2428
01:36:10,679 --> 01:36:16,590
because the famine was sore in all the

2429
01:36:12,929 --> 01:36:19,280
lands now when Jacob saw that there was

2430
01:36:16,590 --> 01:36:21,749
corn in Egypt Jacob said unto his sons

2431
01:36:19,280 --> 01:36:22,320
why are you standing around looking at

2432
01:36:21,749 --> 01:36:24,239
each other

2433
01:36:22,320 --> 01:36:28,199
he said I've heard that there's corn in

2434
01:36:24,239 --> 01:36:30,510
Egypt get down there and buy from by for

2435
01:36:28,199 --> 01:36:33,320
us so that we may live and not die it's

2436
01:36:30,510 --> 01:36:35,820
a pretty straightforward advice that and

2437
01:36:33,320 --> 01:36:38,849
Joseph's ten brothers went down to buy

2438
01:36:35,820 --> 01:36:40,679
corn in Egypt but Benjamin Joseph's

2439
01:36:38,849 --> 01:36:42,869
brother so that's the youngest one right

2440
01:36:40,679 --> 01:36:44,489
the only one left it's the one that was

2441
01:36:42,869 --> 01:36:47,849
younger than Joseph the only youngest

2442
01:36:44,489 --> 01:36:49,829
one and also rachel's other son but Jeb

2443
01:36:47,849 --> 01:36:52,789
Benjamin Joseph's brother Jacob didn't

2444
01:36:49,829 --> 01:36:55,019
send because he was worried that

2445
01:36:52,789 --> 01:36:57,659
something bad would happen to him which

2446
01:36:55,019 --> 01:36:59,309
kind of indicates to me that maybe Jacob

2447
01:36:57,659 --> 01:37:01,739
was a bit suspicious about what had

2448
01:36:59,309 --> 01:37:05,789
happened to Joseph the last time he sent

2449
01:37:01,739 --> 01:37:07,409
all the brothers on a adventure and

2450
01:37:05,789 --> 01:37:10,110
Joseph was the governor over all the

2451
01:37:07,409 --> 01:37:11,519
land and and he it was that sold to all

2452
01:37:10,110 --> 01:37:13,230
the people of the land and Joseph's

2453
01:37:11,519 --> 01:37:15,030
brothers came and bowed down themselves

2454
01:37:13,230 --> 01:37:19,199
before him with their faces to the earth

2455
01:37:15,030 --> 01:37:23,340
well there's the dream now the thing is

2456
01:37:19,199 --> 01:37:24,960
too is that one question you have in

2457
01:37:23,340 --> 01:37:28,139
your life is who should you bow down to

2458
01:37:24,960 --> 01:37:29,699
and you might say no one that's not

2459
01:37:28,139 --> 01:37:31,110
exactly the right answer because that

2460
01:37:29,699 --> 01:37:32,670
means that you don't have an ideal

2461
01:37:31,110 --> 01:37:34,590
because you bow down to your ideal

2462
01:37:32,670 --> 01:37:35,909
that's what makes it an ideal and if you

2463
01:37:34,590 --> 01:37:36,220
don't have an ideal then what the hell

2464
01:37:35,909 --> 01:37:38,350
are you

2465
01:37:36,220 --> 01:37:40,950
do so you have to bow down to something

2466
01:37:38,350 --> 01:37:43,360
and so what happens here is well

2467
01:37:40,950 --> 01:37:45,220
the brothers are bowing down to the

2468
01:37:43,360 --> 01:37:46,750
person who's so bloody resilient and

2469
01:37:45,220 --> 01:37:48,490
competent that they can take themselves

2470
01:37:46,750 --> 01:37:50,500
out of a prison and become the ruler of

2471
01:37:48,490 --> 01:37:52,630
the land that happened to vaclav havel

2472
01:37:50,500 --> 01:37:56,710
right in czechoslovakia it also happened

2473
01:37:52,630 --> 01:37:58,780
to Mandela in South Africa like these

2474
01:37:56,710 --> 01:37:59,740
things actually happen it's really

2475
01:37:58,780 --> 01:38:01,330
something

2476
01:37:59,740 --> 01:38:08,020
so you god only knows what you might

2477
01:38:01,330 --> 01:38:10,990
learn in prison so so they bow down to

2478
01:38:08,020 --> 01:38:13,330
Joseph and properly so you know he's he

2479
01:38:10,990 --> 01:38:15,760
is even without his coat he's still the

2480
01:38:13,330 --> 01:38:17,590
person with the coat of many colors and

2481
01:38:15,760 --> 01:38:19,450
Joseph saw his brothers and he knew them

2482
01:38:17,590 --> 01:38:21,340
but he made them so strange unto them

2483
01:38:19,450 --> 01:38:22,870
it's a number of years have passed and

2484
01:38:21,340 --> 01:38:24,580
he spoke roughly unto them and he said

2485
01:38:22,870 --> 01:38:27,010
unto them where do you come from and

2486
01:38:24,580 --> 01:38:29,680
they said from the land of Canaan to buy

2487
01:38:27,010 --> 01:38:34,600
food and Joseph knew whose brothers were

2488
01:38:29,680 --> 01:38:36,970
but they didn't know who he was and they

2489
01:38:34,600 --> 01:38:39,340
came back to Jacob their father and told

2490
01:38:36,970 --> 01:38:40,960
him all that befell him and said the man

2491
01:38:39,340 --> 01:38:42,520
whose Lord of the country spoke roughly

2492
01:38:40,960 --> 01:38:46,200
to us and took us for spies

2493
01:38:42,520 --> 01:38:48,790
and we said to him where were true men

2494
01:38:46,200 --> 01:38:51,250
honest men we're not spies we be twelve

2495
01:38:48,790 --> 01:38:53,950
brothers sons of our fathers one is not

2496
01:38:51,250 --> 01:38:57,090
and the youngest is this day with our

2497
01:38:53,950 --> 01:38:59,950
Father in the land of Canaan and the man

2498
01:38:57,090 --> 01:39:01,570
said here's how I'll know that you're

2499
01:38:59,950 --> 01:39:04,030
honest men leave one of the brothers

2500
01:39:01,570 --> 01:39:05,560
here with me and take some food for the

2501
01:39:04,030 --> 01:39:07,540
famine of your households and be gone

2502
01:39:05,560 --> 01:39:10,540
and then bring your youngest brother to

2503
01:39:07,540 --> 01:39:12,160
me then I'll know that you're not spies

2504
01:39:10,540 --> 01:39:14,590
but that you're honest men and I'll

2505
01:39:12,160 --> 01:39:17,080
deliver the other brother and he shall

2506
01:39:14,590 --> 01:39:19,090
trade in the land so you don't have to

2507
01:39:17,080 --> 01:39:20,650
starve to death and it came to pass as

2508
01:39:19,090 --> 01:39:23,020
they emptied their sacks that behold

2509
01:39:20,650 --> 01:39:25,030
every man's bundle of money was in his

2510
01:39:23,020 --> 01:39:26,350
sock and when both they and their father

2511
01:39:25,030 --> 01:39:27,160
saw the bundles of money they were

2512
01:39:26,350 --> 01:39:30,160
afraid so

2513
01:39:27,160 --> 01:39:31,330
they had bought food from Joseph and he

2514
01:39:30,160 --> 01:39:34,270
gave them the food and then he put all

2515
01:39:31,330 --> 01:39:35,710
their money back and their socks which I

2516
01:39:34,270 --> 01:39:39,160
could imagine would worry them to some

2517
01:39:35,710 --> 01:39:41,080
degree and Jacob said me you have

2518
01:39:39,160 --> 01:39:42,970
already believed of my children Joseph

2519
01:39:41,080 --> 01:39:45,460
is not as Simeon is not now you'll take

2520
01:39:42,970 --> 01:39:48,160
Benjamin Benjamin away all these things

2521
01:39:45,460 --> 01:39:50,080
are against me and Reuben spake unto his

2522
01:39:48,160 --> 01:39:51,970
father saying slay my two sons if

2523
01:39:50,080 --> 01:39:53,260
bring him not to thee deliver him into

2524
01:39:51,970 --> 01:39:57,610
my hand and I will bring him to the

2525
01:39:53,260 --> 01:39:59,170
again and he and he said no my son shall

2526
01:39:57,610 --> 01:40:00,910
not go down with you for his brother is

2527
01:39:59,170 --> 01:40:03,790
dead and he's left alone if mischief

2528
01:40:00,910 --> 01:40:05,350
befall him by the way in the which you

2529
01:40:03,790 --> 01:40:07,030
shall go then you shall bring down my

2530
01:40:05,350 --> 01:40:10,510
great gray hairs with sorrow to the

2531
01:40:07,030 --> 01:40:12,220
grave now there's a hint see what

2532
01:40:10,510 --> 01:40:14,410
happens in the last part of the Jacob

2533
01:40:12,220 --> 01:40:17,290
storage the Joseph's story is and this

2534
01:40:14,410 --> 01:40:18,790
is associated with the idea of putting

2535
01:40:17,290 --> 01:40:20,020
your house in order your individual

2536
01:40:18,790 --> 01:40:21,490
house in order and then putting your

2537
01:40:20,020 --> 01:40:23,440
family's house in order let's say

2538
01:40:21,490 --> 01:40:25,540
reversed a little bit in this story

2539
01:40:23,440 --> 01:40:28,960
because Joseph puts himself together and

2540
01:40:25,540 --> 01:40:30,070
then he puts the state of Egypt in order

2541
01:40:28,960 --> 01:40:32,320
which is really quite interesting

2542
01:40:30,070 --> 01:40:34,930
because Egypt is the canonical tyranny

2543
01:40:32,320 --> 01:40:37,150
right in the Old Testament and so the

2544
01:40:34,930 --> 01:40:39,310
idea is very very clear here that the

2545
01:40:37,150 --> 01:40:42,310
person who wears the coat of many colors

2546
01:40:39,310 --> 01:40:44,080
can put the tyranny right and then the

2547
01:40:42,310 --> 01:40:46,030
next extension is well he has to put his

2548
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:47,470
family right now you know generally the

2549
01:40:46,030 --> 01:40:49,240
progression would be put yourself right

2550
01:40:47,470 --> 01:40:50,800
then put your family right then put the

2551
01:40:49,240 --> 01:40:52,420
state right something like that it

2552
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:53,950
doesn't really hit if you can do it in a

2553
01:40:52,420 --> 01:40:57,580
different order that's probably ok too

2554
01:40:53,950 --> 01:41:01,600
but so so that's what happens at the end

2555
01:40:57,580 --> 01:41:03,250
of the story is that you know Joseph is

2556
01:41:01,600 --> 01:41:05,320
doing pretty damn well and so is the

2557
01:41:03,250 --> 01:41:07,810
state that he serves but that isn't good

2558
01:41:05,320 --> 01:41:10,740
enough for him he wants his family to be

2559
01:41:07,810 --> 01:41:13,630
functional and put together properly

2560
01:41:10,740 --> 01:41:16,450
even though they did terrible things to

2561
01:41:13,630 --> 01:41:18,970
him and that's very interesting because

2562
01:41:16,450 --> 01:41:21,460
once someone does terrible things to you

2563
01:41:18,970 --> 01:41:23,410
then the logical thing or a logical

2564
01:41:21,460 --> 01:41:25,780
thing to think is well go to hell in a

2565
01:41:23,410 --> 01:41:32,320
handbasket you know like you deserve

2566
01:41:25,780 --> 01:41:34,570
exactly what you get but it's not a very

2567
01:41:32,320 --> 01:41:36,390
productive attitude especially if you're

2568
01:41:34,570 --> 01:41:40,440
around people that you have to be around

2569
01:41:36,390 --> 01:41:42,940
you know so like if it's your family and

2570
01:41:40,440 --> 01:41:44,140
you go have a family dinner and one of

2571
01:41:42,940 --> 01:41:45,640
you punches the other and then the other

2572
01:41:44,140 --> 01:41:47,170
punches you back and then that's like

2573
01:41:45,640 --> 01:41:49,240
the family dinner for the next thirty

2574
01:41:47,170 --> 01:41:50,770
years it doesn't seem to be very

2575
01:41:49,240 --> 01:41:53,020
productive even if you're the person who

2576
01:41:50,770 --> 01:41:54,820
happened to get in the last blow because

2577
01:41:53,020 --> 01:41:57,670
you're gonna have to put up with them at

2578
01:41:54,820 --> 01:42:00,540
minimum it might be nice to just let

2579
01:41:57,670 --> 01:42:03,160
what you can go go and work to make

2580
01:42:00,540 --> 01:42:04,990
towards making things better

2581
01:42:03,160 --> 01:42:06,760
have to get rid of the idea of revenge

2582
01:42:04,990 --> 01:42:13,300
and resentment and all those things that

2583
01:42:06,760 --> 01:42:14,800
you carry along but but it's probably

2584
01:42:13,300 --> 01:42:16,660
better to think about how your family

2585
01:42:14,800 --> 01:42:19,330
could be if it was really functioning

2586
01:42:16,660 --> 01:42:22,570
well and then just a money Ringley at

2587
01:42:19,330 --> 01:42:26,020
that no no that's not easy I mean people

2588
01:42:22,570 --> 01:42:28,990
are very screw in there's no end to the

2589
01:42:26,020 --> 01:42:31,600
depths of Pathology within families but

2590
01:42:28,990 --> 01:42:34,360
of course this story states that very

2591
01:42:31,600 --> 01:42:37,090
clearly I mean they tried to kill him

2592
01:42:34,360 --> 01:42:39,010
they've sold him into slavery it's it's

2593
01:42:37,090 --> 01:42:43,600
a pathological family let's put it that

2594
01:42:39,010 --> 01:42:46,240
way and but Joseph's attitude is well we

2595
01:42:43,600 --> 01:42:47,980
got to set this right not least because

2596
01:42:46,240 --> 01:42:49,690
of his father but it isn't only because

2597
01:42:47,980 --> 01:42:51,880
of his father as you see and as the

2598
01:42:49,690 --> 01:42:53,980
story unfolds and the famine was sore in

2599
01:42:51,880 --> 01:42:55,360
the land and it came to pass when they

2600
01:42:53,980 --> 01:42:56,770
had eaten up the corn which they had

2601
01:42:55,360 --> 01:42:59,020
brought out of Egypt their father said

2602
01:42:56,770 --> 01:43:03,340
unto them go again and buy us a little

2603
01:42:59,020 --> 01:43:05,500
food and Judah spake unto him saying the

2604
01:43:03,340 --> 01:43:07,300
man did solemnly protest unto us you not

2605
01:43:05,500 --> 01:43:08,680
see you will not see my face except your

2606
01:43:07,300 --> 01:43:12,130
brother be with you they can't go back

2607
01:43:08,680 --> 01:43:15,070
to Egypt without Benjamin and they said

2608
01:43:12,130 --> 01:43:16,660
the man asked us straightly of our state

2609
01:43:15,070 --> 01:43:18,490
and of her kindred saying is your father

2610
01:43:16,660 --> 01:43:20,350
yet alive have you another brother and

2611
01:43:18,490 --> 01:43:23,200
we told him according to the tenor of

2612
01:43:20,350 --> 01:43:25,240
those words could we know that he would

2613
01:43:23,200 --> 01:43:27,820
say bring your brother down and Judah

2614
01:43:25,240 --> 01:43:29,680
said unto Israel his father send the

2615
01:43:27,820 --> 01:43:31,870
loud with me and will arise and go that

2616
01:43:29,680 --> 01:43:33,730
we may live and not die both we and vow

2617
01:43:31,870 --> 01:43:36,940
and also our little ones I will be

2618
01:43:33,730 --> 01:43:38,830
surety for him my hand shall they'll

2619
01:43:36,940 --> 01:43:40,870
require him if I bring him not unto thee

2620
01:43:38,830 --> 01:43:45,670
and set them before thee then let me

2621
01:43:40,870 --> 01:43:47,710
bear the blame forever well so Judah who

2622
01:43:45,670 --> 01:43:51,190
played a pretty dismal role in the

2623
01:43:47,710 --> 01:43:53,500
original selling Joseph into slavery

2624
01:43:51,190 --> 01:43:55,210
seems to obviously have learned

2625
01:43:53,500 --> 01:43:57,820
something by this point since he's

2626
01:43:55,210 --> 01:43:59,350
willing to put himself on the line you

2627
01:43:57,820 --> 01:44:01,030
know to take responsibility for the

2628
01:43:59,350 --> 01:44:03,760
situation and to put himself on the line

2629
01:44:01,030 --> 01:44:06,190
and to stand in for Benjamin so he's

2630
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:12,630
making himself into a sacrificial object

2631
01:44:06,190 --> 01:44:13,830
of sorts and so the game that

2632
01:44:12,630 --> 01:44:15,840
Joseph's playing cuz he's sort of

2633
01:44:13,830 --> 01:44:17,460
teasing his brothers but he's also

2634
01:44:15,840 --> 01:44:19,980
testing them the game that he's playing

2635
01:44:17,460 --> 01:44:21,420
is tuefel is one is have you bloody well

2636
01:44:19,980 --> 01:44:22,949
learned anything or are you just as

2637
01:44:21,420 --> 01:44:24,989
corrupt and useless as you were before

2638
01:44:22,949 --> 01:44:27,630
that's game number one in game number

2639
01:44:24,989 --> 01:44:29,639
two is maybe if I poke and prod you and

2640
01:44:27,630 --> 01:44:31,889
put you into a relatively difficult and

2641
01:44:29,639 --> 01:44:34,020
mysterious situation I can get you to

2642
01:44:31,889 --> 01:44:35,610
clue the hell in and the Dorp some

2643
01:44:34,020 --> 01:44:38,010
responsibilities and we can move this

2644
01:44:35,610 --> 01:44:40,889
whole mess forward and so that seems to

2645
01:44:38,010 --> 01:44:42,570
be happening so Judah is taking

2646
01:44:40,889 --> 01:44:44,070
responsibility and Reuben did that as

2647
01:44:42,570 --> 01:44:45,480
well and the men took presence and they

2648
01:44:44,070 --> 01:44:47,159
took double money in their hand and

2649
01:44:45,480 --> 01:44:50,070
Benjamin and rose up and went down to

2650
01:44:47,159 --> 01:44:52,050
Egypt and stood before Joseph and when

2651
01:44:50,070 --> 01:44:53,670
Joseph saw Benjamin with them he said to

2652
01:44:52,050 --> 01:44:57,060
the ruler of his house bring these men

2653
01:44:53,670 --> 01:44:58,650
home and slay and make ready food for

2654
01:44:57,060 --> 01:45:00,929
these men shall dine with me at noon and

2655
01:44:58,650 --> 01:45:03,170
the men man did as Joseph bade and the

2656
01:45:00,929 --> 01:45:05,400
man brought the men into Joseph's house

2657
01:45:03,170 --> 01:45:06,840
and when Joseph came home they brought

2658
01:45:05,400 --> 01:45:10,530
him the presents which was in their hand

2659
01:45:06,840 --> 01:45:13,080
and bowed themselves again to him to the

2660
01:45:10,530 --> 01:45:14,790
earth and he asked them of their welfare

2661
01:45:13,080 --> 01:45:17,370
and said is your father well the old man

2662
01:45:14,790 --> 01:45:19,650
of whom you spake is whom you spake is

2663
01:45:17,370 --> 01:45:21,480
he yet alive and they answered thy

2664
01:45:19,650 --> 01:45:23,670
servant our Father is in good health

2665
01:45:21,480 --> 01:45:29,580
he's yet alive and they bowed down their

2666
01:45:23,670 --> 01:45:31,290
heads and made obeisance and he lifted

2667
01:45:29,580 --> 01:45:34,350
up his eyes and saw his brother Benjamin

2668
01:45:31,290 --> 01:45:36,000
his mother's son and said is this your

2669
01:45:34,350 --> 01:45:38,670
younger brother of whom you spake unto

2670
01:45:36,000 --> 01:45:42,000
me and he said God be gracious unto thee

2671
01:45:38,670 --> 01:45:44,670
my son and Joseph made haste for his

2672
01:45:42,000 --> 01:45:47,429
bowels did yearn upon his brother and he

2673
01:45:44,670 --> 01:45:48,929
saw it where to weep and he entered into

2674
01:45:47,429 --> 01:45:50,370
his chamber and wept there and he washed

2675
01:45:48,929 --> 01:45:52,880
his face and went out and refrained

2676
01:45:50,370 --> 01:45:55,409
himself and said set on the bread and

2677
01:45:52,880 --> 01:45:57,239
they sat before them now he plays

2678
01:45:55,409 --> 01:45:58,679
another trick on his brother so he has

2679
01:45:57,239 --> 01:46:01,739
them all sit at the table but he lines

2680
01:45:58,679 --> 01:46:05,610
them up according to age and so he's

2681
01:46:01,739 --> 01:46:08,699
trying to what is he trying to do start

2682
01:46:05,610 --> 01:46:10,350
to freak them out fundamentally and so

2683
01:46:08,699 --> 01:46:11,940
it and he manages that because they have

2684
01:46:10,350 --> 01:46:13,500
no idea how in the world they could

2685
01:46:11,940 --> 01:46:14,820
possibly he could possibly pull

2686
01:46:13,500 --> 01:46:17,280
something like that off they think it's

2687
01:46:14,820 --> 01:46:20,070
magic and the men marvelled at one

2688
01:46:17,280 --> 01:46:22,380
another and he took and sent messes unto

2689
01:46:20,070 --> 01:46:24,239
them from before him but Benjamin's mess

2690
01:46:22,380 --> 01:46:26,310
was five times as much as any of theirs

2691
01:46:24,239 --> 01:46:28,800
so what's he doing

2692
01:46:26,310 --> 01:46:32,400
well he's testing his brothers again the

2693
01:46:28,800 --> 01:46:35,610
fact that when he was the child Joseph

2694
01:46:32,400 --> 01:46:37,440
that he got more meant that his brothers

2695
01:46:35,610 --> 01:46:39,090
got terribly jealous and then murderous

2696
01:46:37,440 --> 01:46:40,860
right and so now he's doing the same

2697
01:46:39,090 --> 01:46:43,410
thing with Benjamin he's thinking okay

2698
01:46:40,860 --> 01:46:48,330
well I'll give this kid more mm-hmm

2699
01:46:43,410 --> 01:46:50,640
then he is share you know what how these

2700
01:46:48,330 --> 01:46:54,450
reprobates behave and see if they've

2701
01:46:50,640 --> 01:46:56,070
learned anything and so and he commanded

2702
01:46:54,450 --> 01:46:57,690
the steward of his house saying fill the

2703
01:46:56,070 --> 01:46:59,850
men's sock with food as much as they can

2704
01:46:57,690 --> 01:47:02,280
carry and put every money man's money in

2705
01:46:59,850 --> 01:47:03,930
the sock as well and put my cup the

2706
01:47:02,280 --> 01:47:07,260
silver cup in the sacks mouth of the

2707
01:47:03,930 --> 01:47:08,580
youngest and his corn money and the

2708
01:47:07,260 --> 01:47:10,200
steward did according to the word that

2709
01:47:08,580 --> 01:47:12,360
Joseph had spoken as soon as the morning

2710
01:47:10,200 --> 01:47:19,290
was light the men were sent away along

2711
01:47:12,360 --> 01:47:20,910
with their transportation the cup is

2712
01:47:19,290 --> 01:47:27,210
found in Benjamin's sack well so

2713
01:47:20,910 --> 01:47:29,670
Benjamin is kind of young and Joseph

2714
01:47:27,210 --> 01:47:30,780
sends out people to find out where the

2715
01:47:29,670 --> 01:47:33,780
cup has gone and they find it in

2716
01:47:30,780 --> 01:47:37,620
Benjamin's in Benjamin's sock and

2717
01:47:33,780 --> 01:47:39,360
they're very upset about this they said

2718
01:47:37,620 --> 01:47:42,210
that a harsh punishment would befall

2719
01:47:39,360 --> 01:47:43,800
whoever had the cup in his sock they

2720
01:47:42,210 --> 01:47:45,480
rent their clothes and laid it every man

2721
01:47:43,800 --> 01:47:47,760
his house and returned to this city and

2722
01:47:45,480 --> 01:47:49,230
Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's

2723
01:47:47,760 --> 01:47:50,670
house for he was they yet there and they

2724
01:47:49,230 --> 01:47:53,820
fell before him on the ground

2725
01:47:50,670 --> 01:47:55,740
very unhappy and apologetic and Joseph

2726
01:47:53,820 --> 01:47:58,350
said unto them what deed is this that

2727
01:47:55,740 --> 01:48:01,380
you have done ha ha ha don't you know

2728
01:47:58,350 --> 01:48:04,170
that a man like I can certainly divine I

2729
01:48:01,380 --> 01:48:06,330
know what's going on and Judah said what

2730
01:48:04,170 --> 01:48:08,280
shall we say what shall we speak or how

2731
01:48:06,330 --> 01:48:10,530
can we possibly clear ourselves God

2732
01:48:08,280 --> 01:48:12,960
found out the iniquity of thy servants

2733
01:48:10,530 --> 01:48:16,950
behold we are your servants both we and

2734
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:19,920
also he with whom the cup is found and

2735
01:48:16,950 --> 01:48:23,700
he said God forbid that I should do so

2736
01:48:19,920 --> 01:48:25,200
but the man in whose cup and whose hand

2737
01:48:23,700 --> 01:48:27,810
the cup has found he shall be my servant

2738
01:48:25,200 --> 01:48:32,340
and as for you get you up in peace to

2739
01:48:27,810 --> 01:48:34,550
your father it's the discovery of the

2740
01:48:32,340 --> 01:48:34,550
cup

2741
01:48:38,830 --> 01:48:43,370
Judis says now therefore when I come to

2742
01:48:41,390 --> 01:48:45,140
this servant thy father my father and

2743
01:48:43,370 --> 01:48:47,480
the loud be not with us and seeing that

2744
01:48:45,140 --> 01:48:49,310
his life is bound up in the lads life it

2745
01:48:47,480 --> 01:48:52,330
shall come to pass when he sees that the

2746
01:48:49,310 --> 01:48:54,590
lad is not with us that he will die and

2747
01:48:52,330 --> 01:48:56,180
the servants shall bring down the gray

2748
01:48:54,590 --> 01:48:58,100
hairs of thy servant or father with

2749
01:48:56,180 --> 01:49:00,710
sorrow to the grave for thy servant

2750
01:48:58,100 --> 01:49:03,020
became surety for the lad unto my father

2751
01:49:00,710 --> 01:49:04,760
saying if I bring him not unto thee then

2752
01:49:03,020 --> 01:49:08,360
I shall bear the blame to my father

2753
01:49:04,760 --> 01:49:11,930
forever now therefore I pray thee let me

2754
01:49:08,360 --> 01:49:13,760
stay instead of the lad and let the lad

2755
01:49:11,930 --> 01:49:15,980
go with his brothers for how shall I go

2756
01:49:13,760 --> 01:49:16,900
up to my brother and the loud be not

2757
01:49:15,980 --> 01:49:19,490
with me

2758
01:49:16,900 --> 01:49:22,130
lest peradventure I shall see the evil

2759
01:49:19,490 --> 01:49:23,830
that will come on my father ok so what's

2760
01:49:22,130 --> 01:49:28,070
happened well they learned a lesson

2761
01:49:23,830 --> 01:49:30,440
so now Judah again is willing to stand

2762
01:49:28,070 --> 01:49:34,280
in the place of Benjamin and become a

2763
01:49:30,440 --> 01:49:37,180
slave himself and so now Joseph has

2764
01:49:34,280 --> 01:49:39,350
determined that his brothers have

2765
01:49:37,180 --> 01:49:42,370
developed their character to the point

2766
01:49:39,350 --> 01:49:45,520
where reconciliation might be possible

2767
01:49:42,370 --> 01:49:46,820
you know it says you should forgive and

2768
01:49:45,520 --> 01:49:49,900
forget

2769
01:49:46,820 --> 01:49:53,810
but the conditions for that are quite

2770
01:49:49,900 --> 01:49:55,610
are quite specific you know if you're if

2771
01:49:53,810 --> 01:49:57,170
you have a dispute with someone and

2772
01:49:55,610 --> 01:50:00,380
they've wronged you in some sense and

2773
01:49:57,170 --> 01:50:03,080
they apologize the question is what's

2774
01:50:00,380 --> 01:50:06,050
the apology well it's a it's layout of a

2775
01:50:03,080 --> 01:50:07,820
rationale it's something like as far as

2776
01:50:06,050 --> 01:50:10,430
I can tell here's the reasons I did this

2777
01:50:07,820 --> 01:50:11,270
horrible thing and here's what I've

2778
01:50:10,430 --> 01:50:13,430
learned from it

2779
01:50:11,270 --> 01:50:15,560
and here's what I'm gonna do to try not

2780
01:50:13,430 --> 01:50:18,140
to do it again and would you give me

2781
01:50:15,560 --> 01:50:20,210
another crack at it that's the proper

2782
01:50:18,140 --> 01:50:22,730
repentance right and then you forgive

2783
01:50:20,210 --> 01:50:24,320
because you're an idiot too and you'll

2784
01:50:22,730 --> 01:50:25,910
probably do something stupid and maybe

2785
01:50:24,320 --> 01:50:28,400
you'd like the same kind of break at

2786
01:50:25,910 --> 01:50:30,740
some point and and besides if we all

2787
01:50:28,400 --> 01:50:32,750
held each other completely to account at

2788
01:50:30,740 --> 01:50:34,820
all possible times for everything then

2789
01:50:32,750 --> 01:50:35,890
it'd just be hopeless because there

2790
01:50:34,820 --> 01:50:40,070
would be no room for error

2791
01:50:35,890 --> 01:50:42,260
so the forgiveness which Joseph is

2792
01:50:40,070 --> 01:50:44,750
showing is wise forgiveness he's not

2793
01:50:42,260 --> 01:50:46,070
gonna put himself out on the line for

2794
01:50:44,750 --> 01:50:47,780
people who haven't learned so that the

2795
01:50:46,070 --> 01:50:49,280
same stupid thing can happen again so

2796
01:50:47,780 --> 01:50:50,150
that they can continue to spread misery

2797
01:50:49,280 --> 01:50:51,770
wherever they go

2798
01:50:50,150 --> 01:50:54,290
oh he's gonna find out if they've clued

2799
01:50:51,770 --> 01:50:56,179
in a little bit and then if so then they

2800
01:50:54,290 --> 01:50:59,120
can move on with putting a family

2801
01:50:56,179 --> 01:51:01,550
together and so that breaks him up he

2802
01:50:59,120 --> 01:51:03,380
says Joseph could not refrain himself

2803
01:51:01,550 --> 01:51:07,610
before all of them that stood by him and

2804
01:51:03,380 --> 01:51:12,110
he cried and then he said get every man

2805
01:51:07,610 --> 01:51:14,060
away from me so all the people except

2806
01:51:12,110 --> 01:51:15,679
for Joseph's brother left and there

2807
01:51:14,060 --> 01:51:19,010
stood no man with him well Joseph made

2808
01:51:15,679 --> 01:51:21,590
himself known unto his brothers and

2809
01:51:19,010 --> 01:51:24,440
Joseph said I'm Joseph is my father

2810
01:51:21,590 --> 01:51:25,790
still alive and his brothers could not

2811
01:51:24,440 --> 01:51:33,560
answer for they were troubled at his

2812
01:51:25,790 --> 01:51:35,480
presence it's like yeah understatement

2813
01:51:33,560 --> 01:51:37,790
of the decade there mmm

2814
01:51:35,480 --> 01:51:39,500
when Joseph said unto his brothers come

2815
01:51:37,790 --> 01:51:41,030
nearer to me I pray you and they came

2816
01:51:39,500 --> 01:51:43,699
nearer and he said I am Joseph your

2817
01:51:41,030 --> 01:51:45,469
brother who you sold into Egypt but

2818
01:51:43,699 --> 01:51:47,810
don't be grieved or angry with yourself

2819
01:51:45,469 --> 01:51:51,830
that you sold me hither for God did send

2820
01:51:47,810 --> 01:51:53,449
me before you to preserve life so now it

2821
01:51:51,830 --> 01:51:55,790
was not you that sent me here but God

2822
01:51:53,449 --> 01:51:57,350
and he's made me a father to Pharaoh and

2823
01:51:55,790 --> 01:51:59,080
Lord of all his house and a ruler

2824
01:51:57,350 --> 01:52:01,670
throughout all the land of Egypt

2825
01:51:59,080 --> 01:52:05,600
hurry and go to my father and say unto

2826
01:52:01,670 --> 01:52:07,940
Him thus say thy son Joseph God has made

2827
01:52:05,600 --> 01:52:13,010
me Lord of all GE gypped come down unto

2828
01:52:07,940 --> 01:52:14,510
me and Terry nod and thou shalt dwell in

2829
01:52:13,010 --> 01:52:16,010
the land of Goshen and thou shalt be

2830
01:52:14,510 --> 01:52:17,420
near unto me thou and thy children and

2831
01:52:16,010 --> 01:52:18,830
their children's children and thy flocks

2832
01:52:17,420 --> 01:52:22,280
and they herds and all that thou hast

2833
01:52:18,830 --> 01:52:24,440
and I there I will nourish you for yet

2834
01:52:22,280 --> 01:52:26,030
there are five years of famine lest thou

2835
01:52:24,440 --> 01:52:28,250
and I household and all that thou hast

2836
01:52:26,030 --> 01:52:31,159
come to poverty so that's the other

2837
01:52:28,250 --> 01:52:38,480
thing that another bit of a hint it's a

2838
01:52:31,159 --> 01:52:41,150
bread hint here who's the what's the

2839
01:52:38,480 --> 01:52:42,800
most reliable source of bread well it

2840
01:52:41,150 --> 01:52:45,260
isn't bread itself it's whatever it is

2841
01:52:42,800 --> 01:52:47,659
that gives rise to bread and that's what

2842
01:52:45,260 --> 01:52:50,120
Joseph is in this story he's the force

2843
01:52:47,659 --> 01:52:53,270
that gives ride rise to nourishment

2844
01:52:50,120 --> 01:52:55,489
that's an Joseph is often considered a

2845
01:52:53,270 --> 01:52:57,350
type of Christ which means like a

2846
01:52:55,489 --> 01:52:58,790
precursor in some sense that's that's

2847
01:52:57,350 --> 01:53:00,590
one way of thinking about it and you can

2848
01:52:58,790 --> 01:53:03,860
see that echoed right there it's like

2849
01:53:00,590 --> 01:53:07,400
well what do you store up

2850
01:53:03,860 --> 01:53:10,790
for famine you stir up character that's

2851
01:53:07,400 --> 01:53:14,380
the best way through now that doesn't

2852
01:53:10,790 --> 01:53:16,700
mean you don't also store up bread andd

2853
01:53:14,380 --> 01:53:18,590
they went out of Egypt and came into the

2854
01:53:16,700 --> 01:53:20,300
land of Canaan unto Jacob and told him

2855
01:53:18,590 --> 01:53:22,220
Josephus is still alive and he's

2856
01:53:20,300 --> 01:53:24,140
governor and Jacob's heart fainted for

2857
01:53:22,220 --> 01:53:25,790
he didn't believe them they told him all

2858
01:53:24,140 --> 01:53:27,140
the words of Joseph which he said to

2859
01:53:25,790 --> 01:53:29,030
them and when he saw all the wagons

2860
01:53:27,140 --> 01:53:30,980
which Joseph had sent to carry him the

2861
01:53:29,030 --> 01:53:33,980
spirit of Jacob their father revived and

2862
01:53:30,980 --> 01:53:35,870
Israel said it is enough Joseph my son

2863
01:53:33,980 --> 01:53:38,030
is yet alive I will go and see him

2864
01:53:35,870 --> 01:53:39,380
before I die and Israel took his journey

2865
01:53:38,030 --> 01:53:41,300
with all that he had and came to

2866
01:53:39,380 --> 01:53:43,700
Beersheba and offered sacrifices unto

2867
01:53:41,300 --> 01:53:45,620
the God of his father Isaac and God

2868
01:53:43,700 --> 01:53:48,170
spake unto Israel in the visions of the

2869
01:53:45,620 --> 01:53:50,810
night and said Jacob and he said here am

2870
01:53:48,170 --> 01:53:53,030
i he said I am God the God of thy father

2871
01:53:50,810 --> 01:53:55,970
don't fear to go to eat down into Egypt

2872
01:53:53,030 --> 01:53:58,790
for I will make you a great nation there

2873
01:53:55,970 --> 01:54:01,010
and so that's how they Israelites end up

2874
01:53:58,790 --> 01:54:02,840
in Egypt I will go down with the into

2875
01:54:01,010 --> 01:54:05,240
Egypt and I will also surely bring the

2876
01:54:02,840 --> 01:54:07,640
up again and Jacob shall put his hand

2877
01:54:05,240 --> 01:54:09,230
upon thy eyes die dies and Jacob rose up

2878
01:54:07,640 --> 01:54:10,820
from Beersheba and the sons of Israel

2879
01:54:09,230 --> 01:54:11,930
carried Jacob their father and their

2880
01:54:10,820 --> 01:54:13,910
little ones and their wives in the

2881
01:54:11,930 --> 01:54:16,610
wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry

2882
01:54:13,910 --> 01:54:18,860
him so the families now all united in

2883
01:54:16,610 --> 01:54:21,260
the proper state of being that joseph

2884
01:54:18,860 --> 01:54:23,780
has arranged and they took their cattle

2885
01:54:21,260 --> 01:54:25,640
and their goods it's so interesting too

2886
01:54:23,780 --> 01:54:28,580
because of course Joseph isn't even he's

2887
01:54:25,640 --> 01:54:31,430
a foreigner as well as being a former

2888
01:54:28,580 --> 01:54:33,470
slave and prisoner foreigner slave and

2889
01:54:31,430 --> 01:54:36,050
prisoner and yet he ends up ruling Egypt

2890
01:54:33,470 --> 01:54:38,360
sure surely because of the force of his

2891
01:54:36,050 --> 01:54:41,840
character and competence and that's

2892
01:54:38,360 --> 01:54:43,730
really something to think about and they

2893
01:54:41,840 --> 01:54:44,840
took their cattle because that story

2894
01:54:43,730 --> 01:54:46,490
there is that there isn't anything

2895
01:54:44,840 --> 01:54:48,230
stronger than that doesn't matter what

2896
01:54:46,490 --> 01:54:51,790
the circumstances are that there isn't a

2897
01:54:48,230 --> 01:54:56,060
force that's more powerful than that and

2898
01:54:51,790 --> 01:54:58,870
I don't think that that's naive in fact

2899
01:54:56,060 --> 01:55:00,920
I think it's the exact opposite of naive

2900
01:54:58,870 --> 01:55:02,360
no matter where you are you can

2901
01:55:00,920 --> 01:55:05,180
generally make things better if that's

2902
01:55:02,360 --> 01:55:06,830
what you want to do and unless you're

2903
01:55:05,180 --> 01:55:11,060
inside in that place that's really hell

2904
01:55:06,830 --> 01:55:12,590
itself not usually is something that

2905
01:55:11,060 --> 01:55:15,020
elevates you and elevates the people

2906
01:55:12,590 --> 01:55:17,420
around you and you can do that wherever

2907
01:55:15,020 --> 01:55:18,080
you are because there isn't a place that

2908
01:55:17,420 --> 01:55:19,430
sews

2909
01:55:18,080 --> 01:55:21,740
all that you can't do that that's the

2910
01:55:19,430 --> 01:55:23,000
message of the prison and they took

2911
01:55:21,740 --> 01:55:24,380
their cattle and their goods which they

2912
01:55:23,000 --> 01:55:27,590
had gotten in the land of Canaan and

2913
01:55:24,380 --> 01:55:32,030
came into Egypt Jacob and all his seed

2914
01:55:27,590 --> 01:55:33,710
with him and he sent Judah before him

2915
01:55:32,030 --> 01:55:35,750
unto Joseph to direct his face unto

2916
01:55:33,710 --> 01:55:37,280
Gorshin and they came into the land of

2917
01:55:35,750 --> 01:55:38,990
gaussian and Joseph made ready his

2918
01:55:37,280 --> 01:55:41,090
chariot and went to meet Israel his

2919
01:55:38,990 --> 01:55:43,280
father and presented himself to him and

2920
01:55:41,090 --> 01:55:46,820
fell on his neck and wept on his neck a

2921
01:55:43,280 --> 01:55:49,310
good while and Israel said I can now die

2922
01:55:46,820 --> 01:55:51,730
because I've seen your face because

2923
01:55:49,310 --> 01:55:55,700
you're still alive

2924
01:55:51,730 --> 01:55:57,080
and Pharaoh spake unto Joseph saying thy

2925
01:55:55,700 --> 01:55:59,210
father and thy brethren are come unto

2926
01:55:57,080 --> 01:56:00,590
thee and the land of Egypt is before

2927
01:55:59,210 --> 01:56:02,360
thee and the best of the land your

2928
01:56:00,590 --> 01:56:04,610
father and brothers can dwell in the

2929
01:56:02,360 --> 01:56:06,860
land of gaash and let them dwell and if

2930
01:56:04,610 --> 01:56:08,300
there now know any man of activity among

2931
01:56:06,860 --> 01:56:10,730
them then make them rulers over my

2932
01:56:08,300 --> 01:56:12,530
cattle gives them a job and Joseph

2933
01:56:10,730 --> 01:56:15,400
brought in Jacob is farther and set him

2934
01:56:12,530 --> 01:56:17,870
before Pharaoh and Jacob blessed Pharaoh

2935
01:56:15,400 --> 01:56:19,760
that's a very interesting little turn of

2936
01:56:17,870 --> 01:56:24,620
events because you'd expect the opposite

2937
01:56:19,760 --> 01:56:27,380
under those circumstances so it appears

2938
01:56:24,620 --> 01:56:29,720
that Jacob was a man of relatively great

2939
01:56:27,380 --> 01:56:31,670
self possession because that's not it

2940
01:56:29,720 --> 01:56:35,540
you wouldn't bless Queen Elizabeth in

2941
01:56:31,670 --> 01:56:37,730
all likelihood su had a lot of gall and

2942
01:56:35,540 --> 01:56:39,950
pharaoh said unto Jacob how old are you

2943
01:56:37,730 --> 01:56:42,470
and Jacob said I'm a hundred and thirty

2944
01:56:39,950 --> 01:56:44,300
years whew and evil have been the days

2945
01:56:42,470 --> 01:56:45,980
of the years of my life and I've not

2946
01:56:44,300 --> 01:56:48,410
attained unto the days of the years of

2947
01:56:45,980 --> 01:56:50,390
my love the life of my fathers in the

2948
01:56:48,410 --> 01:56:51,740
days of their pilgrimage Jacob blessed

2949
01:56:50,390 --> 01:56:54,380
the Pharaoh and went out from before

2950
01:56:51,740 --> 01:56:55,940
Pharaoh and Israel dwelt in the land of

2951
01:56:54,380 --> 01:56:59,000
Egypt in the country of Gaussian and

2952
01:56:55,940 --> 01:57:01,160
grew and multiplied exceedingly and

2953
01:56:59,000 --> 01:57:04,640
Jacob lived in the land of Egypt 17

2954
01:57:01,160 --> 01:57:08,240
years so the whole age of Jacob was 147

2955
01:57:04,640 --> 01:57:09,860
years and the time drew nigh that Israel

2956
01:57:08,240 --> 01:57:12,320
must die and he called his son Joseph

2957
01:57:09,860 --> 01:57:15,500
and said unto Him if I have now found

2958
01:57:12,320 --> 01:57:17,990
grace in it in thy sight put I pray thee

2959
01:57:15,500 --> 01:57:20,300
the hand under my thigh and deal kindly

2960
01:57:17,990 --> 01:57:22,910
and truly with me bury me not I pray

2961
01:57:20,300 --> 01:57:25,160
thee in Egypt but I will lie with my

2962
01:57:22,910 --> 01:57:27,230
fathers and thou shall carry me out of

2963
01:57:25,160 --> 01:57:30,470
Egypt and bury me in their burying place

2964
01:57:27,230 --> 01:57:31,560
and Joseph said I will do as you have

2965
01:57:30,470 --> 01:57:34,470
said

2966
01:57:31,560 --> 01:57:36,750
and it came to pass after these things

2967
01:57:34,470 --> 01:57:38,370
that one told Joseph behold thy father

2968
01:57:36,750 --> 01:57:40,950
is sick and he took with him his two

2969
01:57:38,370 --> 01:57:43,470
sons Manasseh and Ephraim and one told

2970
01:57:40,950 --> 01:57:45,660
Jacob and said behold thy son and one

2971
01:57:43,470 --> 01:57:48,150
told Jacob and said behold thy son

2972
01:57:45,660 --> 01:57:49,890
Joseph cometh unto thee and his real

2973
01:57:48,150 --> 01:57:52,980
strength in himself and sat upon the bed

2974
01:57:49,890 --> 01:57:56,700
and he Israel said unto Joseph I'd not

2975
01:57:52,980 --> 01:57:59,430
thought to see your face and lo God also

2976
01:57:56,700 --> 01:58:00,690
showed me your children and Joseph

2977
01:57:59,430 --> 01:58:02,760
brought them out from between his knees

2978
01:58:00,690 --> 01:58:04,890
and bowed himself with his face to the

2979
01:58:02,760 --> 01:58:06,690
earth and Joseph took them both Ephraim

2980
01:58:04,890 --> 01:58:08,190
in his right hand towards Israel's left

2981
01:58:06,690 --> 01:58:09,630
hand and menace' and his left hand

2982
01:58:08,190 --> 01:58:12,090
toward Israel's right hand and brought

2983
01:58:09,630 --> 01:58:13,590
them near unto Him and Israel stretched

2984
01:58:12,090 --> 01:58:15,390
out his right hand and laid it upon

2985
01:58:13,590 --> 01:58:18,090
ephram's head who was the younger and

2986
01:58:15,390 --> 01:58:20,610
his left hand upon manases head guiding

2987
01:58:18,090 --> 01:58:22,290
his hands purposefully for manna so was

2988
01:58:20,610 --> 01:58:24,000
the firstborn and when Joseph saw that

2989
01:58:22,290 --> 01:58:26,250
his father laid his right hand on the

2990
01:58:24,000 --> 01:58:27,960
head of Ephraim it displeased him and he

2991
01:58:26,250 --> 01:58:30,440
held up his father's hand to remove it

2992
01:58:27,960 --> 01:58:33,660
from Ephraim's head unto manases head

2993
01:58:30,440 --> 01:58:35,550
and joseph said unto his father not not

2994
01:58:33,660 --> 01:58:37,980
so my father for this is the firstborn

2995
01:58:35,550 --> 01:58:39,900
put the right hand upon his head head

2996
01:58:37,980 --> 01:58:42,990
and his father refused and said I know

2997
01:58:39,900 --> 01:58:44,700
it my son I know it he shall also become

2998
01:58:42,990 --> 01:58:46,500
a people and he shall also be great but

2999
01:58:44,700 --> 01:58:48,030
truly his younger brother shall be

3000
01:58:46,500 --> 01:58:50,300
greater than he and his seed shall

3001
01:58:48,030 --> 01:58:52,680
become a multitude of Nations another

3002
01:58:50,300 --> 01:58:55,200
repeat of the same thing that happens

3003
01:58:52,680 --> 01:58:57,420
continually it says when when God wants

3004
01:58:55,200 --> 01:58:59,220
to intervene in human affairs what he

3005
01:58:57,420 --> 01:59:02,010
does is invert tradition it's something

3006
01:58:59,220 --> 01:59:04,050
like that and so that's a sign that that

3007
01:59:02,010 --> 01:59:05,580
there's something new and special going

3008
01:59:04,050 --> 01:59:07,110
on and that gives precedence to the

3009
01:59:05,580 --> 01:59:09,300
younger child rather than the older

3010
01:59:07,110 --> 01:59:11,070
child precedents to what is new rather

3011
01:59:09,300 --> 01:59:12,590
than what's traditional of course

3012
01:59:11,070 --> 01:59:15,420
sometimes that's necessary because

3013
01:59:12,590 --> 01:59:17,190
tradition is insufficient and sometimes

3014
01:59:15,420 --> 01:59:19,620
something new has to come into being in

3015
01:59:17,190 --> 01:59:21,390
order to update it and Jacob called

3016
01:59:19,620 --> 01:59:23,460
together his sons and said gather

3017
01:59:21,390 --> 01:59:25,820
together so that I can tell you that

3018
01:59:23,460 --> 01:59:28,200
which shall befall you in the last days

3019
01:59:25,820 --> 01:59:29,910
gather yourself together and here you

3020
01:59:28,200 --> 01:59:32,820
sons of Jacob and hearken unto Israel

3021
01:59:29,910 --> 01:59:34,950
your father Reuben I'm not going to go

3022
01:59:32,820 --> 01:59:36,930
through all 12 of these Reuben thou art

3023
01:59:34,950 --> 01:59:39,270
my firstborn my might and the beginning

3024
01:59:36,930 --> 01:59:43,920
of my strength the excellency of dignity

3025
01:59:39,270 --> 01:59:44,940
and the excellency of power now the

3026
01:59:43,920 --> 01:59:48,300
stories

3027
01:59:44,940 --> 01:59:50,790
interesting here because Jacob blesses

3028
01:59:48,300 --> 01:59:55,050
Joseph's sons before he blesses his own

3029
01:59:50,790 --> 01:59:57,960
sons and so what he's doing is placing

3030
01:59:55,050 --> 02:00:00,540
the rights of the firstborn into the

3031
01:59:57,960 --> 02:00:02,250
sons of his favorite son and then he

3032
02:00:00,540 --> 02:00:05,520
goes to his sons and so that has

3033
02:00:02,250 --> 02:00:06,949
implications for the way the biblical

3034
02:00:05,520 --> 02:00:11,880
stories lay themselves out from

3035
02:00:06,949 --> 02:00:13,620
thenceforward the excellency of dignity

3036
02:00:11,880 --> 02:00:15,870
and the excellency of power unstable as

3037
02:00:13,620 --> 02:00:17,820
water thou shalt not excel because thou

3038
02:00:15,870 --> 02:00:20,190
wentest up to thy father's bed then

3039
02:00:17,820 --> 02:00:22,020
defiled it he went up to my couch you

3040
02:00:20,190 --> 02:00:27,060
may remember that Reuben slept with his

3041
02:00:22,020 --> 02:00:29,310
father's cucum concubine Simeon and Levi

3042
02:00:27,060 --> 02:00:33,350
are brethren instruments of cruelty are

3043
02:00:29,310 --> 02:00:35,940
in their habitations stop painting there

3044
02:00:33,350 --> 02:00:41,910
what happened with Simeon and Levi was

3045
02:00:35,940 --> 02:00:44,699
that somebody lay with their sister

3046
02:00:41,910 --> 02:00:48,000
Dinah and then offered to marry her and

3047
02:00:44,699 --> 02:00:49,260
then head and then became circumcised

3048
02:00:48,000 --> 02:00:50,969
because that was part of the deal and

3049
02:00:49,260 --> 02:00:52,860
then held her older men circumcised and

3050
02:00:50,969 --> 02:00:55,050
then Simeon and Levi went in when they

3051
02:00:52,860 --> 02:00:58,440
were recovering and killed them all and

3052
02:00:55,050 --> 02:01:00,810
then Jacob and all his people had to

3053
02:00:58,440 --> 02:01:07,199
leave because all that irritated their

3054
02:01:00,810 --> 02:01:09,030
relatives so see me Simeon and Levi are

3055
02:01:07,199 --> 02:01:11,730
brethren instruments of Cruelty are in

3056
02:01:09,030 --> 02:01:13,320
their habitations o my soul come not

3057
02:01:11,730 --> 02:01:15,570
thou into their secret unto their

3058
02:01:13,320 --> 02:01:17,400
assembly mine honor be not thou United

3059
02:01:15,570 --> 02:01:19,380
for in their anger they slew a man and

3060
02:01:17,400 --> 02:01:21,540
in their self self will they dig down a

3061
02:01:19,380 --> 02:01:23,280
wall cursed be their anger for it was

3062
02:01:21,540 --> 02:01:25,290
fierce and their route for it was cruel

3063
02:01:23,280 --> 02:01:29,160
I will divide them in Jacob and scatter

3064
02:01:25,290 --> 02:01:30,960
them in Israel Judah thou art he whom my

3065
02:01:29,160 --> 02:01:33,060
brethren shall praise thy hand shall be

3066
02:01:30,960 --> 02:01:34,910
in the neck of mine enemies thy father's

3067
02:01:33,060 --> 02:01:38,610
children shall bow down before thee

3068
02:01:34,910 --> 02:01:41,489
Judah is a lion's whelp from the prey my

3069
02:01:38,610 --> 02:01:43,949
son thou art gone up he stooped down he

3070
02:01:41,489 --> 02:01:46,230
couched as a lion and as an old lion who

3071
02:01:43,949 --> 02:01:48,960
shall rouse him up the scepter shall not

3072
02:01:46,230 --> 02:01:50,910
depart from Judah nor a lawgiver from

3073
02:01:48,960 --> 02:01:52,860
between his feet until shiloh come and

3074
02:01:50,910 --> 02:01:56,920
unto him shall the gathering of the

3075
02:01:52,860 --> 02:01:59,590
people be Joseph

3076
02:01:56,920 --> 02:02:01,480
a fruitful bough even a fruitful bough

3077
02:01:59,590 --> 02:02:03,670
by a well whose branch has run over the

3078
02:02:01,480 --> 02:02:05,830
wall the archers have sorely grieved him

3079
02:02:03,670 --> 02:02:08,170
and shot at him and hated him but his

3080
02:02:05,830 --> 02:02:09,850
bull abode in strength and the arms of

3081
02:02:08,170 --> 02:02:12,370
his hands were made strong by the hands

3082
02:02:09,850 --> 02:02:17,739
of the mighty God of Jacob for thence is

3083
02:02:12,370 --> 02:02:19,270
the shepherd the stone of Israel even by

3084
02:02:17,739 --> 02:02:20,770
the god of life farther who shall help

3085
02:02:19,270 --> 02:02:22,330
thee and by their almighty he shall

3086
02:02:20,770 --> 02:02:24,219
bless thee with the blessings of heavens

3087
02:02:22,330 --> 02:02:26,500
above blessings of the deep that lieth

3088
02:02:24,219 --> 02:02:28,690
under blessings of the beasts breasts

3089
02:02:26,500 --> 02:02:30,040
and of the womb the blessings of thy

3090
02:02:28,690 --> 02:02:31,870
father have prevailed above the

3091
02:02:30,040 --> 02:02:33,790
blessings of my progenitors unto the

3092
02:02:31,870 --> 02:02:36,070
utmost bound of the everlasting hills

3093
02:02:33,790 --> 02:02:38,050
they shall be on the head of Joseph and

3094
02:02:36,070 --> 02:02:41,110
on the crown of the head of him that was

3095
02:02:38,050 --> 02:02:44,050
separate from his brethren all these are

3096
02:02:41,110 --> 02:02:45,699
the twelve tribes of Israel and this is

3097
02:02:44,050 --> 02:02:47,170
it that their father spake unto them and

3098
02:02:45,699 --> 02:02:49,810
blessed them everyone according to his

3099
02:02:47,170 --> 02:02:53,020
blessing he blessed them so that what we

3100
02:02:49,810 --> 02:02:54,820
see here is an echo in some sense of

3101
02:02:53,020 --> 02:02:59,050
what happens in the Mesopotamian

3102
02:02:54,820 --> 02:03:01,630
creation story wind in the Mesopotamian

3103
02:02:59,050 --> 02:03:08,650
creation story is the dragon of chaos

3104
02:03:01,630 --> 02:03:10,390
timeout and her consort AB su freshwater

3105
02:03:08,650 --> 02:03:13,030
and saltwater respectively and their

3106
02:03:10,390 --> 02:03:14,830
mingled together and and that

3107
02:03:13,030 --> 02:03:17,290
combination of chaos and order gives

3108
02:03:14,830 --> 02:03:19,239
rise to the first Assembly of the

3109
02:03:17,290 --> 02:03:23,640
ancient gods and then the ancient gods

3110
02:03:19,239 --> 02:03:26,860
kill app soo casually and foolishly and

3111
02:03:23,640 --> 02:03:29,110
enraged time at with their foolishness

3112
02:03:26,860 --> 02:03:33,550
and ignorance and she comes back with a

3113
02:03:29,110 --> 02:03:35,650
vengeance in the meantime and then she

3114
02:03:33,550 --> 02:03:37,390
produces this huge army of monsters and

3115
02:03:35,650 --> 02:03:38,920
puts King knew the worst of the monsters

3116
02:03:37,390 --> 02:03:41,290
at its head and then decides she's going

3117
02:03:38,920 --> 02:03:43,719
to take out her creation and so that's a

3118
02:03:41,290 --> 02:03:46,690
little warning from 3,000 years ago

3119
02:03:43,719 --> 02:03:51,910
about foolishly undermining your

3120
02:03:46,690 --> 02:03:53,530
tradition so anyways the gods in their

3121
02:03:51,910 --> 02:03:55,360
frenzy go out and try to fight against

3122
02:03:53,530 --> 02:03:58,030
timeout and they come back with her

3123
02:03:55,360 --> 02:03:59,770
tails between their legs continually but

3124
02:03:58,030 --> 02:04:01,540
then a new God appears on the scene and

3125
02:03:59,770 --> 02:04:03,250
that's Marduk he's got eyes all the way

3126
02:04:01,540 --> 02:04:07,780
around his head and he can speak words

3127
02:04:03,250 --> 02:04:10,720
of magic and they know that there's

3128
02:04:07,780 --> 02:04:12,820
something new about this newest God it

3129
02:04:10,720 --> 02:04:15,010
his capacity for vision in this capacity

3130
02:04:12,820 --> 02:04:16,210
for articulate speech and so they say

3131
02:04:15,010 --> 02:04:19,810
well why don't you go out and try to

3132
02:04:16,210 --> 02:04:22,090
deal with the chaos and mardik says yeah

3133
02:04:19,810 --> 02:04:25,300
ok no problem but here's the deal you

3134
02:04:22,090 --> 02:04:27,910
elect me talk God and now I determine

3135
02:04:25,300 --> 02:04:30,250
the destiny of the world and so they're

3136
02:04:27,910 --> 02:04:31,870
desperate because like timeout is coming

3137
02:04:30,250 --> 02:04:33,610
to get them that's chaos with the worst

3138
02:04:31,870 --> 02:04:34,900
of all possible monsters they're

3139
02:04:33,610 --> 02:04:38,110
probably thinking he's not gonna win

3140
02:04:34,900 --> 02:04:40,510
anyways and so they agree and out he

3141
02:04:38,110 --> 02:04:42,930
goes and he confronts time out who's the

3142
02:04:40,510 --> 02:04:45,550
goddess of chaos he cuts her into pieces

3143
02:04:42,930 --> 02:04:47,890
and he makes the world out of her pieces

3144
02:04:45,550 --> 02:04:49,960
and one of his name's is he who makes

3145
02:04:47,890 --> 02:04:52,630
ingenious things out of the combat with

3146
02:04:49,960 --> 02:04:56,470
taya math which is so interesting that's

3147
02:04:52,630 --> 02:04:58,900
such a remarkable that's a remarkable

3148
02:04:56,470 --> 02:05:02,470
bit of nomenclature so who's should be

3149
02:04:58,900 --> 02:05:04,450
at the pinnacle the force that sees and

3150
02:05:02,470 --> 02:05:07,480
speaks and goes out to confront chaos

3151
02:05:04,450 --> 02:05:09,760
voluntarily you know how many years it

3152
02:05:07,480 --> 02:05:12,460
took people to figure that out that's

3153
02:05:09,760 --> 02:05:13,510
like the pinnacle discovery of humanity

3154
02:05:12,460 --> 02:05:16,120
that's what that is

3155
02:05:13,510 --> 02:05:18,760
it's echoed here you know you see Simeon

3156
02:05:16,120 --> 02:05:20,440
and Levi they're too angry the other

3157
02:05:18,760 --> 02:05:22,770
brothers they all have flaws and faults

3158
02:05:20,440 --> 02:05:25,720
of various sorts and so they're not

3159
02:05:22,770 --> 02:05:27,460
elevated to the highest place but Joseph

3160
02:05:25,720 --> 02:05:28,930
because he has his coat of many colors

3161
02:05:27,460 --> 02:05:30,760
and because he lands on his feet no

3162
02:05:28,930 --> 02:05:33,370
matter where he goes and because he's

3163
02:05:30,760 --> 02:05:36,220
not resentful and bitter and malevolent

3164
02:05:33,370 --> 02:05:39,040
and genocide 'el and and he's not

3165
02:05:36,220 --> 02:05:42,670
shaking his fist at the sky or yelling

3166
02:05:39,040 --> 02:05:45,750
at God because of Trump let's say then

3167
02:05:42,670 --> 02:05:48,820
he's the he's the right he's the right

3168
02:05:45,750 --> 02:05:52,560
representative of the 12 tribes and so

3169
02:05:48,820 --> 02:05:54,700
that's brilliant it's a brilliant story

3170
02:05:52,560 --> 02:05:56,530
all these are the twelve tribes of

3171
02:05:54,700 --> 02:05:58,000
Israel and this is it that their fathers

3172
02:05:56,530 --> 02:05:59,680
spake unto them and blessed them every

3173
02:05:58,000 --> 02:06:02,980
one according to his blessing he blessed

3174
02:05:59,680 --> 02:06:04,630
them and when Jacob had made an end of

3175
02:06:02,980 --> 02:06:07,120
commanding his son so it's the last

3176
02:06:04,630 --> 02:06:10,950
thing he does to state he knows that

3177
02:06:07,120 --> 02:06:10,950
these are the twelve tribes that will

3178
02:06:12,030 --> 02:06:16,600
progress into the future of this people

3179
02:06:14,770 --> 02:06:18,850
and now he's trying it the last thing he

3180
02:06:16,600 --> 02:06:21,940
does is to try to hierarchically

3181
02:06:18,850 --> 02:06:24,670
organized their relative virtues as an

3182
02:06:21,940 --> 02:06:26,830
indication of what has been learned

3183
02:06:24,670 --> 02:06:28,360
and when jacob has made an end of

3184
02:06:26,830 --> 02:06:30,100
commanding his sons he gathered up his

3185
02:06:28,360 --> 02:06:31,630
feet into the bed and yielded up the

3186
02:06:30,100 --> 02:06:34,060
ghost and was gathered unto his people

3187
02:06:31,630 --> 02:06:35,740
and joseph fell upon his father's face

3188
02:06:34,060 --> 02:06:37,690
and wept upon him and kissed him and

3189
02:06:35,740 --> 02:06:40,180
Joseph commanded his servants to the

3190
02:06:37,690 --> 02:06:43,870
physicians to embalm his father and the

3191
02:06:40,180 --> 02:06:45,580
physicians embalmed Israel when the days

3192
02:06:43,870 --> 02:06:47,740
of his mourning were passed Joseph spake

3193
02:06:45,580 --> 02:06:51,100
unto the house of Pharaoh saying if now

3194
02:06:47,740 --> 02:06:52,840
I have found grace in your eyes speak I

3195
02:06:51,100 --> 02:06:55,630
pray you in the ears of Pharaoh saying

3196
02:06:52,840 --> 02:06:57,610
my father made me swear saying lo I die

3197
02:06:55,630 --> 02:06:59,650
in my grave which I have digged for me

3198
02:06:57,610 --> 02:07:02,050
in the land of Canaan there shalt thou

3199
02:06:59,650 --> 02:07:03,790
bury me now therefore let me go up I

3200
02:07:02,050 --> 02:07:05,950
pray thee and bury my father and I will

3201
02:07:03,790 --> 02:07:08,200
come again and Pharaoh said go up and

3202
02:07:05,950 --> 02:07:11,200
bury thy father according as he made

3203
02:07:08,200 --> 02:07:12,880
thee swear for his sons carried him into

3204
02:07:11,200 --> 02:07:15,220
the land of Canaan and buried him in the

3205
02:07:12,880 --> 02:07:16,780
cave of the field of Machpelah which

3206
02:07:15,220 --> 02:07:18,790
Abraham bought with the field for a

3207
02:07:16,780 --> 02:07:19,750
possession of the burying place of

3208
02:07:18,790 --> 02:07:22,690
Ephraim the head

3209
02:07:19,750 --> 02:07:24,640
before Mamre and Joseph returned unto

3210
02:07:22,690 --> 02:07:28,210
Egypt he and his brethren and all that

3211
02:07:24,640 --> 02:07:29,590
went up to him and that all and all that

3212
02:07:28,210 --> 02:07:31,480
went up with him to burry his father

3213
02:07:29,590 --> 02:07:33,490
after he is buried after he had buried

3214
02:07:31,480 --> 02:07:37,350
his father and when Joseph's brethren

3215
02:07:33,490 --> 02:07:40,390
saw that their father was dead they said

3216
02:07:37,350 --> 02:07:43,120
Joseph will now hate us and will

3217
02:07:40,390 --> 02:07:45,820
certainly pay back to us all the evil

3218
02:07:43,120 --> 02:07:48,160
which we did unto him and they sent a

3219
02:07:45,820 --> 02:07:51,100
messenger saying my father did command

3220
02:07:48,160 --> 02:07:53,140
before he died saying for shall ye say

3221
02:07:51,100 --> 02:07:55,150
unto Joseph forgive I pray thee now the

3222
02:07:53,140 --> 02:07:57,940
trespass of thy brethren and their sin

3223
02:07:55,150 --> 02:07:59,800
pretty snively really for they did unto

3224
02:07:57,940 --> 02:08:01,660
the evil and now we pray they forgive

3225
02:07:59,800 --> 02:08:04,510
the trespass of the servants of the God

3226
02:08:01,660 --> 02:08:06,820
of thy father and Joseph wept when they

3227
02:08:04,510 --> 02:08:08,620
spake unto him and his brethren also

3228
02:08:06,820 --> 02:08:11,500
went and fell down before his face and

3229
02:08:08,620 --> 02:08:15,730
they said Behold we be thy servants and

3230
02:08:11,500 --> 02:08:18,040
Joseph said unto them fear not for am I

3231
02:08:15,730 --> 02:08:20,440
in the place of God but as for you you

3232
02:08:18,040 --> 02:08:23,140
thought evil against me but God meant it

3233
02:08:20,440 --> 02:08:29,110
unto good to bring to pass as it is this

3234
02:08:23,140 --> 02:08:30,700
day to save much people alive now

3235
02:08:29,110 --> 02:08:32,380
therefore fear ye not I will nourish you

3236
02:08:30,700 --> 02:08:35,640
and your little ones any comfort of them

3237
02:08:32,380 --> 02:08:35,640
and spake kindly unto them

3238
02:08:39,929 --> 02:08:50,530
so the the idea there is that there is

3239
02:08:47,980 --> 02:08:55,780
no evil so evil that good cannot triumph

3240
02:08:50,530 --> 02:08:57,940
over it and Joseph dwelt in Egypt he and

3241
02:08:55,780 --> 02:09:00,130
his father's house and Joseph lived 110

3242
02:08:57,940 --> 02:09:01,840
years and Joseph saw ephram's children

3243
02:09:00,130 --> 02:09:04,330
of the third generation the children

3244
02:09:01,840 --> 02:09:07,480
also of marker the son of menace' were

3245
02:09:04,330 --> 02:09:10,150
brought up upon Joseph's knees and

3246
02:09:07,480 --> 02:09:12,580
Joseph said unto his brethren I die and

3247
02:09:10,150 --> 02:09:14,320
God will surely visit you and bring you

3248
02:09:12,580 --> 02:09:16,830
out of this land unto the land where he

3249
02:09:14,320 --> 02:09:19,090
swear to Abraham to Isaac and Jacob and

3250
02:09:16,830 --> 02:09:20,770
Joseph took an oath of the children of

3251
02:09:19,090 --> 02:09:22,869
Israel saying God will surely visit you

3252
02:09:20,770 --> 02:09:23,530
and show and you shall carry my bones

3253
02:09:22,869 --> 02:09:25,929
from hence

3254
02:09:23,530 --> 02:09:29,380
so Joseph died being a hundred and ten

3255
02:09:25,929 --> 02:09:32,739
years old and they embalmed him and he

3256
02:09:29,380 --> 02:09:39,449
was put into a coffin in Egypt and

3257
02:09:32,739 --> 02:09:39,449
that's Genesis so

3258
02:09:52,989 --> 02:09:57,210
so thank you all for persevering

3259
02:10:15,170 --> 02:10:18,300
[Music]

3260
02:10:24,720 --> 02:10:29,020
thank you thank you well this has been

3261
02:10:27,040 --> 02:10:31,630
very worthwhile as far as I'm concerned

3262
02:10:29,020 --> 02:10:33,220
I learned an awful lot and so I'm very

3263
02:10:31,630 --> 02:10:35,170
much looking forward to continuing with

3264
02:10:33,220 --> 02:10:37,360
it and thank you all very much for your

3265
02:10:35,170 --> 02:10:39,790
support and your rapt attention and your

3266
02:10:37,360 --> 02:10:42,670
seriousness in this endeavor and your

3267
02:10:39,790 --> 02:10:44,620
care and all of that it's really being a

3268
02:10:42,670 --> 02:10:48,720
privilege to be able to do this it's a

3269
02:10:44,620 --> 02:10:51,460
completely surreal thing to manage and

3270
02:10:48,720 --> 02:10:53,590
so far you know I think about five

3271
02:10:51,460 --> 02:10:57,720
million people have watched it so that

3272
02:10:53,590 --> 02:10:57,720
seems to be a very good thing

3273
02:11:05,939 --> 02:11:11,070
okay so I'm gonna ask the questioners if

3274
02:11:09,389 --> 02:11:14,159
you've asked a question in the last

3275
02:11:11,070 --> 02:11:16,469
three sessions please don't ask a

3276
02:11:14,159 --> 02:11:19,229
question today because I I never get

3277
02:11:16,469 --> 02:11:20,639
through everyone and so I'd like to have

3278
02:11:19,229 --> 02:11:22,889
some questions from people that I

3279
02:11:20,639 --> 02:11:26,909
haven't answered questions from before

3280
02:11:22,889 --> 02:11:29,309
if that's okay hi professor Peterson

3281
02:11:26,909 --> 02:11:31,110
just a 2-second thank you very much from

3282
02:11:29,309 --> 02:11:32,849
my community in the Jewish community so

3283
02:11:31,110 --> 02:11:34,860
many people have been inspired you by

3284
02:11:32,849 --> 02:11:35,669
you to be better people and I wouldn't

3285
02:11:34,860 --> 02:11:39,269
be able to speak to you without saying

3286
02:11:35,669 --> 02:11:40,650
that so thank you very much a couple of

3287
02:11:39,269 --> 02:11:42,119
things the first thing I wanted to do is

3288
02:11:40,650 --> 02:11:43,289
make a quick comment that you might find

3289
02:11:42,119 --> 02:11:46,199
interesting that in the Jewish

3290
02:11:43,289 --> 02:11:47,760
astrological calendar we read the

3291
02:11:46,199 --> 02:11:49,260
'really cycle of the the five books of

3292
02:11:47,760 --> 02:11:51,539
Moses and it just so happens that we are

3293
02:11:49,260 --> 02:11:55,669
reading this part of the of the Torah

3294
02:11:51,539 --> 02:11:57,719
story school and synchronistic yeah

3295
02:11:55,669 --> 02:11:59,969
which brings me into a question I want

3296
02:11:57,719 --> 02:12:01,550
to ask you about which is one question

3297
02:11:59,969 --> 02:12:04,949
with two parts about your knowledge of

3298
02:12:01,550 --> 02:12:06,119
Hebrew because if you look at the Torah

3299
02:12:04,949 --> 02:12:08,159
scrolls that you find in a synagogue

3300
02:12:06,119 --> 02:12:11,729
there are no vowels there are no

3301
02:12:08,159 --> 02:12:13,650
sentences there it is it is chaos chaos

3302
02:12:11,729 --> 02:12:15,209
and order is trying to be bought into it

3303
02:12:13,650 --> 02:12:16,769
I'm wondering how knowledge of you

3304
02:12:15,209 --> 02:12:20,039
knowledgeable are you of the Hebrew

3305
02:12:16,769 --> 02:12:23,880
which has many layers of I'm staggering

3306
02:12:20,039 --> 02:12:26,219
the ignorant of it so you know I read a

3307
02:12:23,880 --> 02:12:29,189
lot of commentaries right I'm trying to

3308
02:12:26,219 --> 02:12:31,110
zero in on the like with each of the

3309
02:12:29,189 --> 02:12:32,579
phrases that we went through today I

3310
02:12:31,110 --> 02:12:35,999
probably looked at ten different

3311
02:12:32,579 --> 02:12:38,760
commentaries and so and then I have this

3312
02:12:35,999 --> 02:12:42,360
underlying psychoanalytic knowledge that

3313
02:12:38,760 --> 02:12:44,249
it's sort of like if you have a bunch of

3314
02:12:42,360 --> 02:12:46,619
different templates to look at things

3315
02:12:44,249 --> 02:12:48,510
through and then something shines

3316
02:12:46,619 --> 02:12:50,939
through all those templates at the same

3317
02:12:48,510 --> 02:12:55,559
time that's very unlikely and so then

3318
02:12:50,939 --> 02:12:57,479
you can you know a coincidence is one

3319
02:12:55,559 --> 02:12:59,070
thing but five coincidences that's no

3320
02:12:57,479 --> 02:13:01,559
longer a coincidence that's something

3321
02:12:59,070 --> 02:13:03,449
else and so I think I'm hoping that

3322
02:13:01,559 --> 02:13:05,909
despite the fact that there's many many

3323
02:13:03,449 --> 02:13:07,769
things that I don't know that there's

3324
02:13:05,909 --> 02:13:09,239
enough things that I do know to kind of

3325
02:13:07,769 --> 02:13:13,289
weave my way through this with some

3326
02:13:09,239 --> 02:13:14,939
degree of utility if not certainty yeah

3327
02:13:13,289 --> 02:13:16,320
cuz I just which is the second part

3328
02:13:14,939 --> 02:13:18,479
which I guess maybe you don't know but

3329
02:13:16,320 --> 02:13:19,620
the the majestic the Jewish oral stories

3330
02:13:18,479 --> 02:13:21,480
that date back almost

3331
02:13:19,620 --> 02:13:25,080
as long as these stories which fill in a

3332
02:13:21,480 --> 02:13:26,370
lot of mind-blowing ly crazy random so

3333
02:13:25,080 --> 02:13:27,180
many details about these stories and I

3334
02:13:26,370 --> 02:13:28,710
was just wondering if you had

3335
02:13:27,180 --> 02:13:30,540
encountered any of them before I've

3336
02:13:28,710 --> 02:13:33,360
encountered some of them but again it's

3337
02:13:30,540 --> 02:13:36,810
it's well as you know it's a very very

3338
02:13:33,360 --> 02:13:38,250
rich tradition and so I haven't

3339
02:13:36,810 --> 02:13:40,170
encountered enough of it

3340
02:13:38,250 --> 02:13:42,210
were you thinking of anything in

3341
02:13:40,170 --> 02:13:44,430
specific specifically in relationship to

3342
02:13:42,210 --> 02:13:46,350
this story not in particular I actually

3343
02:13:44,430 --> 02:13:49,290
forgot it I was I was intending to bring

3344
02:13:46,350 --> 02:13:55,970
you a book of majestic story that's a

3345
02:13:49,290 --> 02:13:58,680
hell of a thing to say now to say that

3346
02:13:55,970 --> 02:13:59,790
but yeah maybe for the exodus version

3347
02:13:58,680 --> 02:14:03,350
I'll bring you this all right all right

3348
02:13:59,790 --> 02:14:03,350
that would be good yeah okay

3349
02:14:03,410 --> 02:14:09,840
hi dr. Peterson I would just like to ask

3350
02:14:07,320 --> 02:14:11,970
you to please talk about what you called

3351
02:14:09,840 --> 02:14:15,000
a psychic death also known as an ego

3352
02:14:11,970 --> 02:14:17,160
death okay sorry say that again would

3353
02:14:15,000 --> 02:14:19,980
you please talk about what you refer to

3354
02:14:17,160 --> 02:14:23,820
as a psychic death also called an ego

3355
02:14:19,980 --> 02:14:27,240
death that's what happens when someone

3356
02:14:23,820 --> 02:14:30,450
who loves you betrays you right so

3357
02:14:27,240 --> 02:14:32,820
imagine that like the world is

3358
02:14:30,450 --> 02:14:34,560
complicated beyond comprehension

3359
02:14:32,820 --> 02:14:36,870
right and you only see a very little bit

3360
02:14:34,560 --> 02:14:38,490
of it and the way you structure your

3361
02:14:36,870 --> 02:14:40,530
understanding is you make assumptions

3362
02:14:38,490 --> 02:14:43,190
about things and they're simplifying

3363
02:14:40,530 --> 02:14:46,620
assumptions so if you trust someone you

3364
02:14:43,190 --> 02:14:48,920
reduce their complexity massively right

3365
02:14:46,620 --> 02:14:51,420
because like let's say we were married

3366
02:14:48,920 --> 02:14:52,980
then there's a whole bunch of ways that

3367
02:14:51,420 --> 02:14:56,250
you're going to act that are going to be

3368
02:14:52,980 --> 02:14:58,260
simpler okay so then I can tolerate

3369
02:14:56,250 --> 02:15:02,210
being around you in some sense because

3370
02:14:58,260 --> 02:15:02,210
you're not everything at once

3371
02:15:02,390 --> 02:15:09,750
now those simplifying structures are

3372
02:15:06,830 --> 02:15:11,450
hierarchically assembled and some of

3373
02:15:09,750 --> 02:15:13,860
them are far more important than others

3374
02:15:11,450 --> 02:15:15,480
Trust is one of them especially trust in

3375
02:15:13,860 --> 02:15:17,160
loved ones family members which is why

3376
02:15:15,480 --> 02:15:19,770
betrayal by a family member is really

3377
02:15:17,160 --> 02:15:21,990
catastrophic because it you know it

3378
02:15:19,770 --> 02:15:23,460
destabilizes your past right all the

3379
02:15:21,990 --> 02:15:25,440
memories you have it destabilizes your

3380
02:15:23,460 --> 02:15:27,360
present it destabilizes your future it

3381
02:15:25,440 --> 02:15:29,910
shakes your faith in human beings

3382
02:15:27,360 --> 02:15:32,599
including yourself and everything

3383
02:15:29,910 --> 02:15:36,469
collapses and that's an ego death

3384
02:15:32,599 --> 02:15:38,300
and so now underneath the ego as far as

3385
02:15:36,469 --> 02:15:40,820
Jung was concerned was another structure

3386
02:15:38,300 --> 02:15:42,739
that he called the self and the self is

3387
02:15:40,820 --> 02:15:48,649
the thing that remains constant across

3388
02:15:42,739 --> 02:15:49,489
ego deaths but it's it's deeper and less

3389
02:15:48,649 --> 02:15:52,909
personal

3390
02:15:49,489 --> 02:15:54,590
it's archetypal and it's the thing that

3391
02:15:52,909 --> 02:15:56,689
the Eagle collapses into when it

3392
02:15:54,590 --> 02:15:59,749
collapses and then that rebuilds the ego

3393
02:15:56,689 --> 02:16:02,359
something like that across time but

3394
02:15:59,749 --> 02:16:04,070
that's when an ego death is now there's

3395
02:16:02,359 --> 02:16:07,429
variants of that because you can have a

3396
02:16:04,070 --> 02:16:09,320
voluntary or involuntary ego death and a

3397
02:16:07,429 --> 02:16:11,899
voluntary ego death is when you learn a

3398
02:16:09,320 --> 02:16:14,030
bunch and you're willing to let go so

3399
02:16:11,899 --> 02:16:15,590
that would be your own emulation it's

3400
02:16:14,030 --> 02:16:17,169
like you're lighting you're a Phoenix

3401
02:16:15,590 --> 02:16:19,820
and your lighting yourself on fire

3402
02:16:17,169 --> 02:16:22,309
that's a much better idea even though it

3403
02:16:19,820 --> 02:16:24,349
can still be really harsh the

3404
02:16:22,309 --> 02:16:25,820
involuntary ego deaths they're really

3405
02:16:24,349 --> 02:16:27,949
hard on people people will do almost

3406
02:16:25,820 --> 02:16:30,229
anything to stop that from happening

3407
02:16:27,949 --> 02:16:35,179
which is partly why they fight to

3408
02:16:30,229 --> 02:16:37,179
maintain their group fostered axiomatic

3409
02:16:35,179 --> 02:16:40,819
simplifications it's not surprising

3410
02:16:37,179 --> 02:16:42,349
because it's very you'd lose your like

3411
02:16:40,819 --> 02:16:44,420
that ego death is a journey into the

3412
02:16:42,349 --> 02:16:46,159
underworld or it's a collapse into chaos

3413
02:16:44,420 --> 02:16:48,800
and that's not so bad if you do it

3414
02:16:46,159 --> 02:16:50,239
purposefully but in the Pinocchio story

3415
02:16:48,800 --> 02:16:52,010
for example that's exemplified by

3416
02:16:50,239 --> 02:16:53,840
Pinocchio going down to the depths to

3417
02:16:52,010 --> 02:16:55,550
rescue his father from the whale now he

3418
02:16:53,840 --> 02:16:57,590
does that voluntarily but a damn near

3419
02:16:55,550 --> 02:17:00,469
kills it right I mean first of all he

3420
02:16:57,590 --> 02:17:02,929
hardly gets out of the whale second he

3421
02:17:00,469 --> 02:17:04,849
actually drowns and dies but he comes

3422
02:17:02,929 --> 02:17:09,019
back to life so even if you do it

3423
02:17:04,849 --> 02:17:10,580
voluntarily it's still life it's just

3424
02:17:09,019 --> 02:17:12,469
better than doing it involuntarily

3425
02:17:10,580 --> 02:17:22,929
which is the other alternative so that's

3426
02:17:12,469 --> 02:17:26,420
what it is you bet hello Doctor Buddhism

3427
02:17:22,929 --> 02:17:27,979
so I've been listening to back to all of

3428
02:17:26,420 --> 02:17:30,349
these biblical lectures for the second

3429
02:17:27,979 --> 02:17:32,210
time now and I wanted to show you an

3430
02:17:30,349 --> 02:17:33,469
observation I came upon because I was

3431
02:17:32,210 --> 02:17:35,029
trying to find a question that you

3432
02:17:33,469 --> 02:17:37,519
haven't been asked before which is

3433
02:17:35,029 --> 02:17:39,330
harder than doing my ryerson exams

3434
02:17:37,519 --> 02:17:42,450
that's for sure

3435
02:17:39,330 --> 02:17:46,500
so so I've noticed I think you're

3436
02:17:42,450 --> 02:17:48,330
getting funnier oh yes oh no I think

3437
02:17:46,500 --> 02:17:50,069
Michael Coren said that this week I

3438
02:17:48,330 --> 02:17:53,790
think but the word he used was bizarre I

3439
02:17:50,069 --> 02:17:55,620
think actually I'm feeling better so

3440
02:17:53,790 --> 02:17:58,229
that's I actually have a sense of humor

3441
02:17:55,620 --> 02:17:59,819
it's it's hard to believe that but so it

3442
02:17:58,229 --> 02:18:01,969
sort of comes back when I'm not feeling

3443
02:17:59,819 --> 02:18:05,219
like I'm going to die at any moment so

3444
02:18:01,969 --> 02:18:06,960
yeah I basically noticed one you're

3445
02:18:05,219 --> 02:18:16,439
making more attempts at jokes so that's

3446
02:18:06,960 --> 02:18:18,500
great thank you thank you too those

3447
02:18:16,439 --> 02:18:20,790
jokes are landing more often all right

3448
02:18:18,500 --> 02:18:23,969
but then there's this third element

3449
02:18:20,790 --> 02:18:25,950
which I think was what Steve Martin quit

3450
02:18:23,969 --> 02:18:27,960
because of which is that I think the

3451
02:18:25,950 --> 02:18:29,880
audience is anticipating jokes more and

3452
02:18:27,960 --> 02:18:31,410
they're actually you know I've noticed

3453
02:18:29,880 --> 02:18:33,359
people laughing more at things that

3454
02:18:31,410 --> 02:18:35,149
aren't intending to be jokes so I was

3455
02:18:33,359 --> 02:18:37,740
just wondering what you make of that and

3456
02:18:35,149 --> 02:18:39,540
they're intended I'm hoping they're

3457
02:18:37,740 --> 02:18:41,219
intended just because I keep a straight

3458
02:18:39,540 --> 02:18:44,490
face doesn't mean they're not intended

3459
02:18:41,219 --> 02:18:46,859
to be jokes so yeah no it's good look

3460
02:18:44,490 --> 02:18:49,290
one of the things is like it's and I try

3461
02:18:46,859 --> 02:18:51,120
to keep this and the wild goal probably

3462
02:18:49,290 --> 02:18:52,139
about five years ago that even when

3463
02:18:51,120 --> 02:18:54,719
you're dealing with really serious

3464
02:18:52,139 --> 02:18:56,550
matters that if you're not handling it

3465
02:18:54,719 --> 02:18:58,319
with a light touch you're not an expert

3466
02:18:56,550 --> 02:18:59,700
at it you know what a master out it and

3467
02:18:58,319 --> 02:19:01,679
you think well there are some things

3468
02:18:59,700 --> 02:19:04,559
that are so deep and dark that you can't

3469
02:19:01,679 --> 02:19:07,319
handle it with a light touch and that's

3470
02:19:04,559 --> 02:19:09,120
actually not true you can that doesn't

3471
02:19:07,319 --> 02:19:10,530
mean you make light of them it doesn't

3472
02:19:09,120 --> 02:19:14,399
mean anything like that it's that you

3473
02:19:10,530 --> 02:19:15,990
don't it's minimal necessary force it's

3474
02:19:14,399 --> 02:19:18,240
something like that you don't hit it any

3475
02:19:15,990 --> 02:19:20,340
harder than you have to and it's a it's

3476
02:19:18,240 --> 02:19:23,519
an art when you're discussing serious

3477
02:19:20,340 --> 02:19:26,010
matters and so well one of the up shots

3478
02:19:23,519 --> 02:19:27,899
of that is that because we're discussing

3479
02:19:26,010 --> 02:19:29,340
serious Madison because serious matters

3480
02:19:27,899 --> 02:19:30,689
are being discussed in the ultra large

3481
02:19:29,340 --> 02:19:32,099
right now it would be really good if

3482
02:19:30,689 --> 02:19:34,620
everybody could keep their sense of

3483
02:19:32,099 --> 02:19:36,450
humor you know and I see positive signs

3484
02:19:34,620 --> 02:19:38,910
of that like there's a lot of satirical

3485
02:19:36,450 --> 02:19:41,160
activity on the net you know and that

3486
02:19:38,910 --> 02:19:44,519
could easily catalyze into horror mob

3487
02:19:41,160 --> 02:19:45,960
but it isn't it is it is you know that's

3488
02:19:44,519 --> 02:19:48,569
happening to some degree but a lot of

3489
02:19:45,960 --> 02:19:50,310
its satire in comedy and as long as we

3490
02:19:48,569 --> 02:19:53,010
can keep a sense of humor about this

3491
02:19:50,310 --> 02:19:55,140
then I think well

3492
02:19:53,010 --> 02:19:57,630
we're not as close to disaster as we

3493
02:19:55,140 --> 02:19:59,399
might be and so what one of the things

3494
02:19:57,630 --> 02:20:01,439
that I have found rather ominous is that

3495
02:19:59,399 --> 02:20:04,069
there are comedians first of all being

3496
02:20:01,439 --> 02:20:06,449
persecuted for under free speech

3497
02:20:04,069 --> 02:20:08,430
restriction legislation which i think is

3498
02:20:06,449 --> 02:20:10,499
absolutely appalling but also that there

3499
02:20:08,430 --> 02:20:14,479
are comedians now who won't perform on

3500
02:20:10,499 --> 02:20:14,479
university campuses John Cleese won't

3501
02:20:14,989 --> 02:20:18,479
Seinfeld that's like well you know how

3502
02:20:16,800 --> 02:20:21,270
offensive he is it's no wonder that I

3503
02:20:18,479 --> 02:20:23,159
mean he's like the straightest nicest

3504
02:20:21,270 --> 02:20:25,199
comedian you could possibly imagine he

3505
02:20:23,159 --> 02:20:26,999
won't perform on college campuses I

3506
02:20:25,199 --> 02:20:32,249
think louis c.k won't perform on or

3507
02:20:26,999 --> 02:20:35,039
anywhere else but it's a bad sign but no

3508
02:20:32,249 --> 02:20:37,170
humor humor is good and it's interesting

3509
02:20:35,039 --> 02:20:40,020
because I've been kind of watching how

3510
02:20:37,170 --> 02:20:42,210
I'm represented on the web weirdly

3511
02:20:40,020 --> 02:20:44,220
enough and there's all these memes that

3512
02:20:42,210 --> 02:20:47,520
have emerged I don't know thousands of

3513
02:20:44,220 --> 02:20:50,369
the bloody things and most of them are

3514
02:20:47,520 --> 02:20:54,149
comical and that's good like people are

3515
02:20:50,369 --> 02:20:55,409
are there hat there whatever it is that

3516
02:20:54,149 --> 02:20:57,060
they're doing I don't know what the hell

3517
02:20:55,409 --> 02:20:59,039
it is but it's being done with a

3518
02:20:57,060 --> 02:20:59,999
relatively light touch and that's really

3519
02:20:59,039 --> 02:21:01,890
really good

3520
02:20:59,999 --> 02:21:03,810
that's how it should be you got to have

3521
02:21:01,890 --> 02:21:06,149
a sense of humor I mean it's one of the

3522
02:21:03,810 --> 02:21:09,600
things that makes life bearable so or

3523
02:21:06,149 --> 02:21:11,810
maybe even better than bearable so you

3524
02:21:09,600 --> 02:21:11,810
bet

3525
02:21:15,840 --> 02:21:23,770
hello dr. Peterson just want to say what

3526
02:21:20,800 --> 02:21:26,470
a great lecture series and this is

3527
02:21:23,770 --> 02:21:30,240
lesson this year so merry Christmas to

3528
02:21:26,470 --> 02:21:30,240
you and your family thank you thank you

3529
02:21:31,020 --> 02:21:37,899
don't get too enthusiastic about that I

3530
02:21:35,520 --> 02:21:40,930
wrote you an essay of a question and

3531
02:21:37,899 --> 02:21:42,670
then I used the lecture of the essay

3532
02:21:40,930 --> 02:21:45,850
writing guide on it's like 2:30 to

3533
02:21:42,670 --> 02:21:48,460
narrow it down to just a few pages a few

3534
02:21:45,850 --> 02:21:50,770
lines and then during this at this

3535
02:21:48,460 --> 02:21:52,780
particular lecture like the zig zag

3536
02:21:50,770 --> 02:21:56,380
slide manifest again and I thought I

3537
02:21:52,780 --> 02:22:00,460
basically just had all my questions

3538
02:21:56,380 --> 02:22:07,420
answered so basically I just I want to

3539
02:22:00,460 --> 02:22:10,600
ask the idea of your you've made a

3540
02:22:07,420 --> 02:22:13,330
lecture that was on YouTube many years

3541
02:22:10,600 --> 02:22:16,479
ago and you keep referring to Cain and

3542
02:22:13,330 --> 02:22:19,000
Abel and the the death of Abel by Cain

3543
02:22:16,479 --> 02:22:21,580
and the curse in it and I think well

3544
02:22:19,000 --> 02:22:25,300
that that was the that was a single

3545
02:22:21,580 --> 02:22:28,060
brother two brothers conflict but but

3546
02:22:25,300 --> 02:22:31,780
here we have in the sense of Jacob the

3547
02:22:28,060 --> 02:22:34,060
twelve there was one who was one who's

3548
02:22:31,780 --> 02:22:36,370
good one who was an able archetype and

3549
02:22:34,060 --> 02:22:40,060
there were twelve eleven that came after

3550
02:22:36,370 --> 02:22:44,170
him so that I don't know maybe there's

3551
02:22:40,060 --> 02:22:45,729
something about the division or no

3552
02:22:44,170 --> 02:22:46,600
that's a good observation I didn't

3553
02:22:45,729 --> 02:22:49,180
thought about that

3554
02:22:46,600 --> 02:22:51,310
yeah well I mean there's a bit of

3555
02:22:49,180 --> 02:22:52,930
variability because Reuben and Reuben

3556
02:22:51,310 --> 02:22:54,910
isn't quite as bad as the rest but yeah

3557
02:22:52,930 --> 02:22:57,880
I would say it's probably easier for the

3558
02:22:54,910 --> 02:23:00,880
Cain side to multiply luckily it's not

3559
02:22:57,880 --> 02:23:06,220
as powerful because it doesn't do

3560
02:23:00,880 --> 02:23:08,680
anything like it yes yes and you know

3561
02:23:06,220 --> 02:23:13,120
you know there's young was often

3562
02:23:08,680 --> 02:23:14,530
included accused of manichaean isn't I'm

3563
02:23:13,120 --> 02:23:16,359
not pronouncing that properly but there

3564
02:23:14,530 --> 02:23:18,460
was a there was a variant of Christian

3565
02:23:16,359 --> 02:23:20,710
dogma that held that good and evil were

3566
02:23:18,460 --> 02:23:23,290
separate metaphysical realities and that

3567
02:23:20,710 --> 02:23:25,660
they were battling for the for

3568
02:23:23,290 --> 02:23:27,500
governance of the cosmos something like

3569
02:23:25,660 --> 02:23:30,470
that but they both had an independent

3570
02:23:27,500 --> 02:23:32,810
and the classical Christian idea which

3571
02:23:30,470 --> 02:23:34,790
one out over that was that no that good

3572
02:23:32,810 --> 02:23:36,830
was real but evil was the absence of

3573
02:23:34,790 --> 02:23:38,690
good now that produced all sorts of the

3574
02:23:36,830 --> 02:23:40,910
absence of good produces all sorts of

3575
02:23:38,690 --> 02:23:43,130
consequences and it is interesting to

3576
02:23:40,910 --> 02:23:45,680
read young because he does get kind of

3577
02:23:43,130 --> 02:23:46,700
Manichean in his discussions and I think

3578
02:23:45,680 --> 02:23:48,680
it was partly because he was so

3579
02:23:46,700 --> 02:23:50,750
concerned about what happened in Nazi

3580
02:23:48,680 --> 02:23:52,340
Germany and then with cold war

3581
02:23:50,750 --> 02:23:56,210
afterwards you know because evil seemed

3582
02:23:52,340 --> 02:23:59,630
to be a palpable force but I don't think

3583
02:23:56,210 --> 02:24:01,250
that it's as powerful as good but I do

3584
02:23:59,630 --> 02:24:04,850
think it's easier for it to multiply

3585
02:24:01,250 --> 02:24:07,040
because it's what's easier path it's

3586
02:24:04,850 --> 02:24:09,950
easy to be resentful and hostile and

3587
02:24:07,040 --> 02:24:12,170
bitter and and do nothing that's easy

3588
02:24:09,950 --> 02:24:13,430
it's horrible and it's hard on people

3589
02:24:12,170 --> 02:24:16,100
but it doesn't require a tremendous

3590
02:24:13,430 --> 02:24:18,170
amount of faith or effort so maybe that

3591
02:24:16,100 --> 02:24:20,900
is why it's multiplied in the final

3592
02:24:18,170 --> 02:24:23,450
story in Genesis yeah and I've been

3593
02:24:20,900 --> 02:24:26,750
reading ahead and for my own based on

3594
02:24:23,450 --> 02:24:29,600
the interest of the president presented

3595
02:24:26,750 --> 02:24:31,790
stories and I I keyed in on a few other

3596
02:24:29,600 --> 02:24:33,860
books and chapters in the Bible like

3597
02:24:31,790 --> 02:24:37,190
first Corinthians 13 which is the love

3598
02:24:33,860 --> 02:24:39,520
chapter and that cycles through the idea

3599
02:24:37,190 --> 02:24:44,410
of I can have all things in life

3600
02:24:39,520 --> 02:24:44,410
knowledge power but it's all passing and

3601
02:24:44,890 --> 02:24:50,420
now and forever our hope faith hope and

3602
02:24:47,510 --> 02:24:52,970
love and and of course love triumphs

3603
02:24:50,420 --> 02:24:54,590
over all yeah well the love issue see

3604
02:24:52,970 --> 02:24:56,300
I've been saying I thought a lot about

3605
02:24:54,590 --> 02:24:58,520
the relationship between love and truth

3606
02:24:56,300 --> 02:25:00,710
because I've thought and talked a lot

3607
02:24:58,520 --> 02:25:02,120
more about truth and I think partly

3608
02:25:00,710 --> 02:25:04,930
that's because love is a word that you

3609
02:25:02,120 --> 02:25:07,400
can hardly even say because it's been so

3610
02:25:04,930 --> 02:25:09,140
it's like it's being dragged behind a

3611
02:25:07,400 --> 02:25:11,630
car through mud puddles it's something

3612
02:25:09,140 --> 02:25:13,730
like that but so sorry let me just

3613
02:25:11,630 --> 02:25:16,610
finish it lab rating this idea but I

3614
02:25:13,730 --> 02:25:19,490
think that the the love idea is

3615
02:25:16,610 --> 02:25:20,870
associated with for me at least with

3616
02:25:19,490 --> 02:25:23,330
what I discussed at the beginning of

3617
02:25:20,870 --> 02:25:25,220
this lecture with regards to faith I

3618
02:25:23,330 --> 02:25:28,040
think you have to make a decision about

3619
02:25:25,220 --> 02:25:31,070
what your attitude towards being is

3620
02:25:28,040 --> 02:25:33,680
going to be and the proper attitude in

3621
02:25:31,070 --> 02:25:36,230
my estimation is that you're working for

3622
02:25:33,680 --> 02:25:38,510
its betterment you know and so maybe

3623
02:25:36,230 --> 02:25:39,660
maybe you have the same attitude towards

3624
02:25:38,510 --> 02:25:42,000
being as you do

3625
02:25:39,660 --> 02:25:44,040
towards someone that you love like a son

3626
02:25:42,000 --> 02:25:47,070
or a daughter or wife that you want

3627
02:25:44,040 --> 02:25:50,010
things to be better and that so that's

3628
02:25:47,070 --> 02:25:54,420
your aim so the aim is basically the aim

3629
02:25:50,010 --> 02:25:55,950
is motivated by love you want things to

3630
02:25:54,420 --> 02:25:57,930
be better because I think that's a good

3631
02:25:55,950 --> 02:25:59,910
definition of love like if you really

3632
02:25:57,930 --> 02:26:02,010
care for someone you can tell because

3633
02:25:59,910 --> 02:26:04,290
you want things to be better for them

3634
02:26:02,010 --> 02:26:06,271
and then I think truth is nested inside

3635
02:26:04,290 --> 02:26:08,340
that because I think that truth is the

3636
02:26:06,271 --> 02:26:16,771
best servant of love it's something like

3637
02:26:08,340 --> 02:26:18,510
that so I've been struggling with an

3638
02:26:16,771 --> 02:26:19,650
idea recently that I was thinking maybe

3639
02:26:18,510 --> 02:26:22,590
you'd be able to help me out with

3640
02:26:19,650 --> 02:26:24,990
basically in a recent interview you

3641
02:26:22,590 --> 02:26:27,410
talked about how myth is meant to

3642
02:26:24,990 --> 02:26:31,891
reconcile inherent contradictions in

3643
02:26:27,410 --> 02:26:34,610
reality right but but I'm sort of stuck

3644
02:26:31,891 --> 02:26:36,570
between two mythological or

3645
02:26:34,610 --> 02:26:39,000
psychoanalytic ideas that I think are

3646
02:26:36,570 --> 02:26:40,800
both really important but they seem to

3647
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:42,061
have a inherent contradiction within

3648
02:26:40,800 --> 02:26:44,190
them that I've been trying to figure out

3649
02:26:42,061 --> 02:26:46,200
so on one hand you have this idea that

3650
02:26:44,190 --> 02:26:47,851
there's times in your life where you

3651
02:26:46,200 --> 02:26:50,160
have to identify things in yourself that

3652
02:26:47,851 --> 02:26:53,370
are insufficient or there's a problem

3653
02:26:50,160 --> 02:26:55,771
somehow that you have to kind of have a

3654
02:26:53,370 --> 02:26:58,170
controlled burn or like a Phoenix like

3655
02:26:55,771 --> 02:27:00,630
transformation where you discard part of

3656
02:26:58,170 --> 02:27:03,150
yourself that doesn't fit or is not

3657
02:27:00,630 --> 02:27:05,521
working but then on the other hand you

3658
02:27:03,150 --> 02:27:08,700
have talked about this this Union idea

3659
02:27:05,521 --> 02:27:12,061
where as you become really when you get

3660
02:27:08,700 --> 02:27:14,130
older you mature by reincorporating

3661
02:27:12,061 --> 02:27:16,590
things about yourself that you lost when

3662
02:27:14,130 --> 02:27:18,271
you were younger or that you know you're

3663
02:27:16,590 --> 02:27:19,440
trying to integrate your shadow or

3664
02:27:18,271 --> 02:27:22,021
you're trying to find parts of your

3665
02:27:19,440 --> 02:27:23,700
personality that that maybe you've been

3666
02:27:22,021 --> 02:27:25,440
rejecting and trying to figure out how

3667
02:27:23,700 --> 02:27:27,480
to bring them into into the folder in

3668
02:27:25,440 --> 02:27:30,300
the hole so he's got this quote that I

3669
02:27:27,480 --> 02:27:33,330
really like which is I'd rather behold

3670
02:27:30,300 --> 02:27:35,790
and good right right so so on one hand

3671
02:27:33,330 --> 02:27:37,440
you may identify something as a problem

3672
02:27:35,790 --> 02:27:40,021
and you want to get rid of it or burn it

3673
02:27:37,440 --> 02:27:44,790
off but then on the other hand it seems

3674
02:27:40,021 --> 02:27:46,891
like the the path to being stronger is

3675
02:27:44,790 --> 02:27:49,950
to figure out how to put everything

3676
02:27:46,891 --> 02:27:51,360
together so there's that there's a one

3677
02:27:49,950 --> 02:27:53,399
of the things Jung wrote about in his

3678
02:27:51,360 --> 02:27:56,100
works on alchemy was

3679
02:27:53,399 --> 02:27:59,280
an explanation of the prime alchemical

3680
02:27:56,100 --> 02:28:03,390
dictum which was solve a coagula which

3681
02:27:59,280 --> 02:28:06,330
meant dissolve and integrate right so so

3682
02:28:03,390 --> 02:28:10,530
imagine this imagine that imagine you

3683
02:28:06,330 --> 02:28:13,070
had a fairly hostile father who was not

3684
02:28:10,530 --> 02:28:15,630
very well controlled in his aggression

3685
02:28:13,070 --> 02:28:18,180
decent person other than that but let's

3686
02:28:15,630 --> 02:28:20,760
say that and so your reaction is I'm

3687
02:28:18,180 --> 02:28:22,939
never going to be aggressive and so

3688
02:28:20,760 --> 02:28:26,540
you've built a like a moral structure

3689
02:28:22,939 --> 02:28:29,100
that's part of your personality and

3690
02:28:26,540 --> 02:28:31,530
there's possibility floating around

3691
02:28:29,100 --> 02:28:36,840
outside of that did you you've denied an

3692
02:28:31,530 --> 02:28:39,180
ethical you've denied any ethical what

3693
02:28:36,840 --> 02:28:41,010
would you say you've stripped the idea

3694
02:28:39,180 --> 02:28:43,710
of aggression of any ethical utility

3695
02:28:41,010 --> 02:28:46,290
whatsoever okay so what happens this

3696
02:28:43,710 --> 02:28:48,140
burns off and then that comes back up

3697
02:28:46,290 --> 02:28:50,729
now you still have to integrate it so

3698
02:28:48,140 --> 02:28:53,790
it's associated in some sense with

3699
02:28:50,729 --> 02:28:56,370
Nietzsche's ideas morality as cowardice

3700
02:28:53,790 --> 02:29:00,240
because one of nature's most trenchant

3701
02:28:56,370 --> 02:29:03,120
critiques of traditional morality let's

3702
02:29:00,240 --> 02:29:05,070
say is that most of what passes for

3703
02:29:03,120 --> 02:29:07,350
morality isn't morality it's just

3704
02:29:05,070 --> 02:29:09,450
cowardice it's not that I'm a good

3705
02:29:07,350 --> 02:29:11,250
person and I don't hurt you it's that

3706
02:29:09,450 --> 02:29:12,840
I'm afraid to hurt you and because I

3707
02:29:11,250 --> 02:29:14,790
don't want to admit that I'm afraid to

3708
02:29:12,840 --> 02:29:17,640
hurt you and then I say I'm moral

3709
02:29:14,790 --> 02:29:19,189
because then I can mask my essential

3710
02:29:17,640 --> 02:29:22,350
fear and cowardice in a guise of

3711
02:29:19,189 --> 02:29:24,570
morality and that happens far more often

3712
02:29:22,350 --> 02:29:26,550
than you would think because harmless

3713
02:29:24,570 --> 02:29:29,880
and moral are by no means the same thing

3714
02:29:26,550 --> 02:29:31,830
so some of what you're burning off you

3715
02:29:29,880 --> 02:29:33,359
can sit and this is where Freud was such

3716
02:29:31,830 --> 02:29:35,399
a genius I think is because he

3717
02:29:33,359 --> 02:29:37,770
concentrated on aggression and sexuality

3718
02:29:35,399 --> 02:29:39,990
which are perhaps the two most difficult

3719
02:29:37,770 --> 02:29:48,730
parts of a personality to integrate said

3720
02:29:39,990 --> 02:29:52,240
that the the hyper simp

3721
02:29:48,730 --> 02:29:55,061
fied morality stops you from tapping

3722
02:29:52,240 --> 02:29:57,221
into deeper recesses of your psyche and

3723
02:29:55,061 --> 02:29:59,681
it's partly because there are primal

3724
02:29:57,221 --> 02:30:01,150
forces it's not surprising that you

3725
02:29:59,681 --> 02:30:03,341
don't want to have anything to do with

3726
02:30:01,150 --> 02:30:04,450
them that you stay away from situations

3727
02:30:03,341 --> 02:30:06,370
where they might make themselves

3728
02:30:04,450 --> 02:30:08,080
manifest but the problem is by denying

3729
02:30:06,370 --> 02:30:10,780
the worst in yourself in that manner

3730
02:30:08,080 --> 02:30:13,421
suppressing it you preclude the

3731
02:30:10,780 --> 02:30:14,860
possibility of the best because no one

3732
02:30:13,421 --> 02:30:17,440
can be a good person without integrating

3733
02:30:14,860 --> 02:30:19,391
their capacity for aggression because

3734
02:30:17,440 --> 02:30:23,591
without that capacity of a progression

3735
02:30:19,391 --> 02:30:25,570
you cannot say no because no means if

3736
02:30:23,591 --> 02:30:28,240
you really say it no means there isn't

3737
02:30:25,570 --> 02:30:31,150
anything that you can do to me that will

3738
02:30:28,240 --> 02:30:33,280
make me change my mind or or conversely

3739
02:30:31,150 --> 02:30:37,360
it means I will play for higher stakes

3740
02:30:33,280 --> 02:30:39,490
than you will and unless you've got your

3741
02:30:37,360 --> 02:30:41,561
aggression integrated there isn't a

3742
02:30:39,490 --> 02:30:43,780
chance you can say that and if you did

3743
02:30:41,561 --> 02:30:47,290
no one would take you seriously because

3744
02:30:43,780 --> 02:30:49,421
they'd know it was just a show so one of

3745
02:30:47,290 --> 02:30:51,311
the most useful things that Jung did I

3746
02:30:49,421 --> 02:30:52,931
think was to work on this idea of the

3747
02:30:51,311 --> 02:30:54,461
integration of the shadow because he was

3748
02:30:52,931 --> 02:30:56,950
really interested in the idea of evil

3749
02:30:54,461 --> 02:30:59,620
right especially working with trying to

3750
02:30:56,950 --> 02:31:01,061
parcel out what happened in Nazi Germany

3751
02:30:59,620 --> 02:31:02,620
and during the Second World War

3752
02:31:01,061 --> 02:31:04,391
what do you do with the part of you

3753
02:31:02,620 --> 02:31:06,400
that's aggressive and and potentially

3754
02:31:04,391 --> 02:31:08,290
malevolent do you just crush it that's

3755
02:31:06,400 --> 02:31:10,211
the super-ego response in some sense do

3756
02:31:08,290 --> 02:31:13,570
you just put it behind you so to speak

3757
02:31:10,211 --> 02:31:15,671
is that a possibility or do you admit to

3758
02:31:13,570 --> 02:31:20,381
its existence and bring it into the game

3759
02:31:15,671 --> 02:31:22,900
and that's see for Freud in some sense

3760
02:31:20,381 --> 02:31:25,091
morality was super-ego clamping down on

3761
02:31:22,900 --> 02:31:27,761
the it'd and they were fundamentally

3762
02:31:25,091 --> 02:31:29,080
opposed both young and Piaget had a

3763
02:31:27,761 --> 02:31:31,721
different idea and I think they were

3764
02:31:29,080 --> 02:31:35,410
right it's like no no you invite the bad

3765
02:31:31,721 --> 02:31:38,500
guys out to play and so you're an

3766
02:31:35,410 --> 02:31:40,900
aggressive hockey player but it's

3767
02:31:38,500 --> 02:31:43,240
disciplined aggression that makes you

3768
02:31:40,900 --> 02:31:45,131
gives you access to the whole source of

3769
02:31:43,240 --> 02:31:46,990
energy you wouldn't otherwise have and

3770
02:31:45,131 --> 02:31:49,240
then with regards to sexuality it's like

3771
02:31:46,990 --> 02:31:52,080
well untrammeled promiscuity doesn't

3772
02:31:49,240 --> 02:31:55,540
constitute a virtue but neither does

3773
02:31:52,080 --> 02:31:58,091
unavoidable virginity right in fact I

3774
02:31:55,540 --> 02:32:00,610
think that's worse because it also masks

3775
02:31:58,091 --> 02:32:02,390
itself with virtue it's like well you

3776
02:32:00,610 --> 02:32:05,000
should be able to

3777
02:32:02,390 --> 02:32:07,760
you should be able to do things that you

3778
02:32:05,000 --> 02:32:10,580
wouldn't do that's that's like the

3779
02:32:07,760 --> 02:32:14,750
definition of a genuinely moral person

3780
02:32:10,580 --> 02:32:17,960
they could do it but they don't and that

3781
02:32:14,750 --> 02:32:19,880
that's not cowardice and so that's you

3782
02:32:17,960 --> 02:32:22,939
burn off the things that get in the way

3783
02:32:19,880 --> 02:32:24,710
of that integration so when you say

3784
02:32:22,939 --> 02:32:26,630
dissolve and integrate it'd be a good

3785
02:32:24,710 --> 02:32:28,850
way to sort of bring the two ideas

3786
02:32:26,630 --> 02:32:31,790
together that the burning off and the

3787
02:32:28,850 --> 02:32:34,430
difficult process is necessary because

3788
02:32:31,790 --> 02:32:36,739
the elements of yourself are structured

3789
02:32:34,430 --> 02:32:38,989
together in a rigid way that is not

3790
02:32:36,739 --> 02:32:40,479
working properly and that's what happens

3791
02:32:38,989 --> 02:32:43,760
to Geppetto in the belly of the whale

3792
02:32:40,479 --> 02:32:45,949
he's so caught in his presuppositions

3793
02:32:43,760 --> 02:32:47,810
that he can't escape right and so

3794
02:32:45,949 --> 02:32:49,520
Pinocchio represents the new force so

3795
02:32:47,810 --> 02:32:51,680
it's very interesting so when you watch

3796
02:32:49,520 --> 02:32:53,630
Pinocchio try to rescue him the first

3797
02:32:51,680 --> 02:32:55,220
thing Geppetto does is confuse Pinocchio

3798
02:32:53,630 --> 02:32:57,050
with a fish because he wants something

3799
02:32:55,220 --> 02:32:58,399
to eat but Pinocchio is better than

3800
02:32:57,050 --> 02:33:00,680
something to eat because he could rescue

3801
02:32:58,399 --> 02:33:02,060
him so he doesn't need to eat and then

3802
02:33:00,680 --> 02:33:04,399
Pinocchio wants to make a fire in

3803
02:33:02,060 --> 02:33:06,680
Geppetto objects because he's gonna burn

3804
02:33:04,399 --> 02:33:08,090
up all the furniture it's like we don't

3805
02:33:06,680 --> 02:33:10,430
need the damn furniture if we're getting

3806
02:33:08,090 --> 02:33:12,620
out of the whale you know and so so

3807
02:33:10,430 --> 02:33:14,659
Geppetto and and he's old so that that

3808
02:33:12,620 --> 02:33:16,489
that's that that's the rigid structure

3809
02:33:14,659 --> 02:33:18,859
that's the old year that has to die off

3810
02:33:16,489 --> 02:33:20,659
before the new year can be born it's a

3811
02:33:18,859 --> 02:33:22,760
forest fire that allows for new growth

3812
02:33:20,659 --> 02:33:24,830
and and that's how those things are put

3813
02:33:22,760 --> 02:33:26,540
together and to see and it's useful to

3814
02:33:24,830 --> 02:33:28,040
know too because if you burn something

3815
02:33:26,540 --> 02:33:30,649
off you might think well there's nothing

3816
02:33:28,040 --> 02:33:32,300
left it's like that's not true if it's

3817
02:33:30,649 --> 02:33:34,489
dead wood then you have room for new

3818
02:33:32,300 --> 02:33:37,760
growth and you want to be doing that on

3819
02:33:34,489 --> 02:33:40,399
a fairly regular basis that's the that's

3820
02:33:37,760 --> 02:33:42,680
that's the snake that sheds its skin and

3821
02:33:40,399 --> 02:33:45,020
transforms itself right that's that's

3822
02:33:42,680 --> 02:33:46,729
the death and resurrection from a

3823
02:33:45,020 --> 02:33:48,560
psychological perspective it's exactly

3824
02:33:46,729 --> 02:33:50,390
the same idea now we don't know the

3825
02:33:48,560 --> 02:33:51,560
upper limit to that right because we

3826
02:33:50,390 --> 02:33:53,779
don't know what a person would be like

3827
02:33:51,560 --> 02:33:58,390
if they let everything that they could

3828
02:33:53,779 --> 02:34:02,120
let go let go and only let in what was

3829
02:33:58,390 --> 02:34:03,920
seemly let's say but you can see that's

3830
02:34:02,120 --> 02:34:07,250
funny we don't know that to some degree

3831
02:34:03,920 --> 02:34:10,340
you can see people vary from you can see

3832
02:34:07,250 --> 02:34:13,250
people start to do that without that's

3833
02:34:10,340 --> 02:34:16,640
not an rare experience

3834
02:34:13,250 --> 02:34:18,260
and people improve very rapidly they can

3835
02:34:16,640 --> 02:34:20,030
improve their lives very rapidly a lot

3836
02:34:18,260 --> 02:34:22,400
of its low-hanging fruit like if you

3837
02:34:20,030 --> 02:34:24,290
just stop doing really stupid things

3838
02:34:22,400 --> 02:34:28,580
that you know are stupid your life

3839
02:34:24,290 --> 02:34:30,410
improves a lot so and it frees you up it

3840
02:34:28,580 --> 02:34:32,800
also means there's a there's an element

3841
02:34:30,410 --> 02:34:35,480
there that's also associated with pride

3842
02:34:32,800 --> 02:34:37,100
because people tend to take pride in who

3843
02:34:35,480 --> 02:34:40,400
they are and that's a bad idea because

3844
02:34:37,100 --> 02:34:42,080
that stops you from becoming who you

3845
02:34:40,400 --> 02:34:42,560
could be because if you're proud of who

3846
02:34:42,080 --> 02:34:44,420
you are

3847
02:34:42,560 --> 02:34:46,430
you won't let that go when it's

3848
02:34:44,420 --> 02:34:48,260
necessary you won't step away from it

3849
02:34:46,430 --> 02:34:51,140
you know and then you end up being your

3850
02:34:48,260 --> 02:34:53,150
own parody something like that that's

3851
02:34:51,140 --> 02:34:55,190
also a very bad idea you want to be

3852
02:34:53,150 --> 02:34:58,430
continually stepping away from your

3853
02:34:55,190 --> 02:35:00,500
previous self and so big and I guess

3854
02:34:58,430 --> 02:35:03,560
part of that too is that you you have to

3855
02:35:00,500 --> 02:35:05,300
decide you know are you are you order or

3856
02:35:03,560 --> 02:35:07,010
you chaos or you the process that

3857
02:35:05,300 --> 02:35:08,930
mediates between them and if you're the

3858
02:35:07,010 --> 02:35:11,560
process that mediates between them you

3859
02:35:08,930 --> 02:35:13,880
you are the thing that transforms and

3860
02:35:11,560 --> 02:35:16,250
that's the right attitude for human

3861
02:35:13,880 --> 02:35:18,290
being because that's what we are we're

3862
02:35:16,250 --> 02:35:21,320
the thing that voluntarily confronts

3863
02:35:18,290 --> 02:35:24,320
chaos and transforms that's what we are

3864
02:35:21,320 --> 02:35:27,620
and so for better or worse you know

3865
02:35:24,320 --> 02:35:29,930
that's our deepest biological essence

3866
02:35:27,620 --> 02:35:31,460
you might say and so you can let things

3867
02:35:29,930 --> 02:35:35,230
go if you know that there's more growth

3868
02:35:31,460 --> 02:35:35,230
to come so

3869
02:35:41,960 --> 02:35:47,729
one more thank you for your time and

3870
02:35:45,449 --> 02:35:51,989
thank you for spending time with us hey

3871
02:35:47,729 --> 02:35:53,790
my pleasure so if I could since we are

3872
02:35:51,989 --> 02:35:55,649
at the end of Genesis I like the

3873
02:35:53,790 --> 02:35:57,260
opportunity to challenge or at least

3874
02:35:55,649 --> 02:36:00,330
have you take another look at your

3875
02:35:57,260 --> 02:36:02,399
position you've held with regards to

3876
02:36:00,330 --> 02:36:05,100
Cain's reflection on the murder of evil

3877
02:36:02,399 --> 02:36:06,390
I bring this up because it's actually a

3878
02:36:05,100 --> 02:36:09,359
part of Genesis that has bothered me for

3879
02:36:06,390 --> 02:36:11,250
a while and it's not like because not as

3880
02:36:09,359 --> 02:36:13,590
straightforward as its presented usually

3881
02:36:11,250 --> 02:36:16,020
and it's really I've been wrestling with

3882
02:36:13,590 --> 02:36:18,029
it so in this series as well as in a

3883
02:36:16,020 --> 02:36:20,160
couple of your maps of meaning lectures

3884
02:36:18,029 --> 02:36:22,260
you summarized that something to the

3885
02:36:20,160 --> 02:36:24,510
effect of Cain coming to the conclusion

3886
02:36:22,260 --> 02:36:26,040
that what he did leads to a punishment

3887
02:36:24,510 --> 02:36:28,890
which is more than he believes he can

3888
02:36:26,040 --> 02:36:30,630
face which I believe to be born out of a

3889
02:36:28,890 --> 02:36:33,000
natural reading of a specific

3890
02:36:30,630 --> 02:36:36,029
translation choices incorrectly made or

3891
02:36:33,000 --> 02:36:39,420
enter a innocently made by editors just

3892
02:36:36,029 --> 02:36:42,120
for readability sake so in Genesis 4:13

3893
02:36:39,420 --> 02:36:45,020
Cain does not say my punishment is

3894
02:36:42,120 --> 02:36:49,260
greater than I can bear he actually says

3895
02:36:45,020 --> 02:36:52,199
he meets my sin is greater than I can

3896
02:36:49,260 --> 02:36:55,649
bear which is this a.m. which is to say

3897
02:36:52,199 --> 02:36:57,390
it's not his past actions we just say

3898
02:36:55,649 --> 02:37:00,330
it's not his past sections its futures

3899
02:36:57,390 --> 02:37:01,710
consequences which it's just past action

3900
02:37:00,330 --> 02:37:03,810
it's not his future consequences which

3901
02:37:01,710 --> 02:37:06,720
he regrets for him to say our own

3902
02:37:03,810 --> 02:37:08,399
iniquity or sin that is too much for him

3903
02:37:06,720 --> 02:37:10,109
to bear as a reflection on the reality

3904
02:37:08,399 --> 02:37:12,569
of his corruption and not a plea of

3905
02:37:10,109 --> 02:37:14,569
Mercy to the deity to spare him mmm okay

3906
02:37:12,569 --> 02:37:17,640
well that's that seems to be a deeper

3907
02:37:14,569 --> 02:37:19,830
interpretation I would say and I think

3908
02:37:17,640 --> 02:37:22,109
it's more that's the same line of

3909
02:37:19,830 --> 02:37:24,600
reasoning that Dostoevsky pursued in

3910
02:37:22,109 --> 02:37:26,520
crime and punishment right because in

3911
02:37:24,600 --> 02:37:28,560
crime and punishment Raskolnikov gets

3912
02:37:26,520 --> 02:37:30,810
away with murder and then he cannot

3913
02:37:28,560 --> 02:37:31,979
stand it he cannot stand that he did it

3914
02:37:30,810 --> 02:37:34,470
because he's no longer the same person

3915
02:37:31,979 --> 02:37:35,310
but even more he cannot stand that he

3916
02:37:34,470 --> 02:37:38,160
got away with it

3917
02:37:35,310 --> 02:37:41,100
so that's more in keeping with with that

3918
02:37:38,160 --> 02:37:43,109
interpretation so this also is reflected

3919
02:37:41,100 --> 02:37:45,569
in the falling verse and 4:14 where he

3920
02:37:43,109 --> 02:37:47,699
states the consequences of his actions

3921
02:37:45,569 --> 02:37:49,229
mainly that God's presence will hot be

3922
02:37:47,699 --> 02:37:51,630
hidden from him and that he will be

3923
02:37:49,229 --> 02:37:53,850
killed the verse opens was the word hane

3924
02:37:51,630 --> 02:37:56,010
which means indeed more or less

3925
02:37:53,850 --> 02:37:58,499
and to note the sense of acceptance and

3926
02:37:56,010 --> 02:38:01,050
not a complaint it is the difference

3927
02:37:58,499 --> 02:38:02,520
between saying oh no well God now hide

3928
02:38:01,050 --> 02:38:04,529
his face from me and will I be hunted

3929
02:38:02,520 --> 02:38:06,680
versus of course God will hide his face

3930
02:38:04,529 --> 02:38:09,779
for me and I will be hunted and killed

3931
02:38:06,680 --> 02:38:11,819
which I've been wrestling with and I've

3932
02:38:09,779 --> 02:38:15,119
taken a way to possibly mean that there

3933
02:38:11,819 --> 02:38:17,850
are sins that we can do that will just

3934
02:38:15,119 --> 02:38:21,359
push us too far well okay there there

3935
02:38:17,850 --> 02:38:23,789
there are well okay so one of the well

3936
02:38:21,359 --> 02:38:25,649
one of the things that you see in

3937
02:38:23,789 --> 02:38:27,810
post-traumatic post-traumatic stress

3938
02:38:25,649 --> 02:38:30,239
disorder situations for example is that

3939
02:38:27,810 --> 02:38:33,390
people view themselves doing something

3940
02:38:30,239 --> 02:38:35,939
so terrible they don't know how to put

3941
02:38:33,390 --> 02:38:37,560
it right so that and so you could say

3942
02:38:35,939 --> 02:38:39,300
under those circumstances the face of

3943
02:38:37,560 --> 02:38:43,260
God is hidden from them because they

3944
02:38:39,300 --> 02:38:45,479
cannot they cannot atone for it they

3945
02:38:43,260 --> 02:38:47,789
can't reconcile themselves to it it's

3946
02:38:45,479 --> 02:38:49,409
there all the time and they can't see

3947
02:38:47,789 --> 02:38:52,649
anything good beyond it it's hell

3948
02:38:49,409 --> 02:38:53,729
essentially and so I mean sometimes when

3949
02:38:52,649 --> 02:38:55,560
you're working with people with

3950
02:38:53,729 --> 02:38:58,829
post-traumatic stress disorder you know

3951
02:38:55,560 --> 02:39:00,720
you you kind of in initiate them into a

3952
02:38:58,829 --> 02:39:03,899
philosophy of good and evil so that they

3953
02:39:00,720 --> 02:39:05,550
can see when Joseph talks to his

3954
02:39:03,899 --> 02:39:07,709
brothers and they've got all this guilt

3955
02:39:05,550 --> 02:39:09,899
right and and he doesn't want them to

3956
02:39:07,709 --> 02:39:12,180
have more guilt than necessary to fix

3957
02:39:09,899 --> 02:39:14,640
themselves because it just burdens them

3958
02:39:12,180 --> 02:39:16,350
otherwise he says look don't forget yeah

3959
02:39:14,640 --> 02:39:19,619
yeah it was you but it's also God's

3960
02:39:16,350 --> 02:39:21,979
doing and I had a client once who who

3961
02:39:19,619 --> 02:39:24,779
had obsessive-compulsive disorder and

3962
02:39:21,979 --> 02:39:26,970
he's a very smart guy he also happened

3963
02:39:24,779 --> 02:39:28,499
to work in a radioactive lab that had a

3964
02:39:26,970 --> 02:39:30,029
lot of radioactive materials which

3965
02:39:28,499 --> 02:39:33,869
wasn't the best place for someone with

3966
02:39:30,029 --> 02:39:35,999
OCD and he was worried that he would

3967
02:39:33,869 --> 02:39:37,829
make some mistake this is very common

3968
02:39:35,999 --> 02:39:40,470
with OCD that would result in someone's

3969
02:39:37,829 --> 02:39:43,199
suffering which you will you'll do that

3970
02:39:40,470 --> 02:39:45,510
and it wasn't until I could get him to

3971
02:39:43,199 --> 02:39:49,499
conceptualize himself and his life in

3972
02:39:45,510 --> 02:39:51,479
part as a force of nature that he was

3973
02:39:49,499 --> 02:39:53,279
able to reconcile himself to the

3974
02:39:51,479 --> 02:39:56,819
possibility that an error on his part

3975
02:39:53,279 --> 02:39:59,129
would produce catastrophic consequences

3976
02:39:56,819 --> 02:40:01,079
but people often find themselves in

3977
02:39:59,129 --> 02:40:02,520
situations where they just they cannot

3978
02:40:01,079 --> 02:40:04,169
reconcile themselves to what they've

3979
02:40:02,520 --> 02:40:06,419
done and that it makes sense to me that

3980
02:40:04,169 --> 02:40:07,351
that the interpretation that you're

3981
02:40:06,419 --> 02:40:10,561
describing that

3982
02:40:07,351 --> 02:40:12,030
that makes them that makes plenty of

3983
02:40:10,561 --> 02:40:15,870
sense from a psychological perspective

3984
02:40:12,030 --> 02:40:17,461
there are sins that will push us like

3985
02:40:15,870 --> 02:40:21,001
just beyond our limit that are too far

3986
02:40:17,461 --> 02:40:22,801
but there are also no consequences to

3987
02:40:21,001 --> 02:40:25,200
our actions that are devoid of a truth

3988
02:40:22,801 --> 02:40:27,480
we can accept and learn from and this is

3989
02:40:25,200 --> 02:40:29,160
what I've kind of dealt out of this bit

3990
02:40:27,480 --> 02:40:31,230
with Cain and Abel so if this is the

3991
02:40:29,160 --> 02:40:33,931
case why then does it take us so long

3992
02:40:31,230 --> 02:40:36,030
and with so much self - now before we

3993
02:40:33,931 --> 02:40:37,921
accept personal responsibility when

3994
02:40:36,030 --> 02:40:44,671
faced with tragedy especially when it's

3995
02:40:37,921 --> 02:40:47,641
self inflicted well I I don't think you

3996
02:40:44,671 --> 02:40:51,051
want to underestimate the contribution

3997
02:40:47,641 --> 02:40:56,851
of just sheer difficulty like you know

3998
02:40:51,051 --> 02:40:59,761
let's say you you you you're grieving

3999
02:40:56,851 --> 02:41:01,081
because someone close to you died it's

4000
02:40:59,761 --> 02:41:02,791
like well it isn't just that you've lost

4001
02:41:01,081 --> 02:41:05,700
them although that's a big part of it

4002
02:41:02,791 --> 02:41:08,700
it's that you have to rebuild yourself

4003
02:41:05,700 --> 02:41:10,851
and it's really hard to do that so and

4004
02:41:08,700 --> 02:41:13,200
it is sort of proportional to the

4005
02:41:10,851 --> 02:41:14,820
significance of your error so if you

4006
02:41:13,200 --> 02:41:16,980
commit an error and then you recognize

4007
02:41:14,820 --> 02:41:18,721
that it's an error if it's a sort of

4008
02:41:16,980 --> 02:41:21,391
surface error it's like well you can

4009
02:41:18,721 --> 02:41:24,211
just touch up the paint but sometimes

4010
02:41:21,391 --> 02:41:29,631
the whole under structure is just rotten

4011
02:41:24,211 --> 02:41:32,190
and then you don't know what to do and

4012
02:41:29,631 --> 02:41:33,931
then so that's one problems just sheer

4013
02:41:32,190 --> 02:41:35,551
bloody difficulty and I see this with

4014
02:41:33,931 --> 02:41:37,860
people very often it's like they're at a

4015
02:41:35,551 --> 02:41:40,351
point in their divorce let's say and

4016
02:41:37,860 --> 02:41:42,530
they don't know what to do they cannot

4017
02:41:40,351 --> 02:41:44,910
solve the problem it's too complicated

4018
02:41:42,530 --> 02:41:46,230
they just don't have the resources and

4019
02:41:44,910 --> 02:41:47,851
maybe they've squandered some of their

4020
02:41:46,230 --> 02:41:49,530
resources as well but sometimes they

4021
02:41:47,851 --> 02:41:51,931
just don't have the resources and then

4022
02:41:49,530 --> 02:41:53,610
if you add to that error and sin and

4023
02:41:51,931 --> 02:41:55,980
malevolence and blindness and all those

4024
02:41:53,610 --> 02:41:57,660
other things people there's a guy named

4025
02:41:55,980 --> 02:41:59,761
Thomas SAS who wrote this really

4026
02:41:57,660 --> 02:42:01,381
interesting article in the 1960s a book

4027
02:41:59,761 --> 02:42:06,150
actually called the myth of mental

4028
02:42:01,381 --> 02:42:07,501
illness and it was classic reading for

4029
02:42:06,150 --> 02:42:09,900
clinical psychologists when I was

4030
02:42:07,501 --> 02:42:12,211
training and the reason for that was is

4031
02:42:09,900 --> 02:42:14,730
that SAS pointed out and this is true is

4032
02:42:12,211 --> 02:42:16,471
that mmm-hmm lots of times if you're a

4033
02:42:14,730 --> 02:42:18,480
psychotherapist people don't come to you

4034
02:42:16,471 --> 02:42:19,971
because they have mental illnesses they

4035
02:42:18,480 --> 02:42:21,240
had come to you because they have

4036
02:42:19,971 --> 02:42:23,221
insoluble

4037
02:42:21,240 --> 02:42:25,710
problems in their life you know like

4038
02:42:23,221 --> 02:42:31,380
maybe they've had a two-year affair at

4039
02:42:25,710 --> 02:42:33,360
work their wife is alcoholic and they

4040
02:42:31,380 --> 02:42:35,700
have a very and their father has

4041
02:42:33,360 --> 02:42:38,610
Alzheimer's disease it's like they just

4042
02:42:35,700 --> 02:42:39,870
don't know what to do it's too much now

4043
02:42:38,610 --> 02:42:41,521
you know they shouldn't have had the

4044
02:42:39,870 --> 02:42:43,440
affair so there's a moral issue and

4045
02:42:41,521 --> 02:42:45,780
maybe they should have intervened in the

4046
02:42:43,440 --> 02:42:47,550
alcoholism in the family maybe they used

4047
02:42:45,780 --> 02:42:49,021
their wives alcoholism as an excuse to

4048
02:42:47,550 --> 02:42:51,181
have the affair you know like these

4049
02:42:49,021 --> 02:42:53,160
things get very tangled it's just it's

4050
02:42:51,181 --> 02:42:56,760
so bloody complicated that people can't

4051
02:42:53,160 --> 02:42:58,230
untangle it so and I would say that's in

4052
02:42:56,760 --> 02:43:00,750
keeping with the interpretation that you

4053
02:42:58,230 --> 02:43:02,910
laid forth with regards to cain is it

4054
02:43:00,750 --> 02:43:04,290
sounds like that's one of the reasons

4055
02:43:02,910 --> 02:43:07,620
why it's so useful to read multiple

4056
02:43:04,290 --> 02:43:10,800
translations right because nuances

4057
02:43:07,620 --> 02:43:12,990
matter it sounds to me from that

4058
02:43:10,800 --> 02:43:15,150
description that he actually woke up at

4059
02:43:12,990 --> 02:43:18,000
least briefly and noticed what he did

4060
02:43:15,150 --> 02:43:20,580
and said there's no coming back from

4061
02:43:18,000 --> 02:43:23,370
this and and it is you can easily get

4062
02:43:20,580 --> 02:43:24,990
places that you do not know how to come

4063
02:43:23,370 --> 02:43:26,580
back from now you know they say well all

4064
02:43:24,990 --> 02:43:28,650
things are possible with God and there's

4065
02:43:26,580 --> 02:43:31,500
always the possibility of redemption no

4066
02:43:28,650 --> 02:43:33,570
matter how serious the sin but I'll tell

4067
02:43:31,500 --> 02:43:38,521
you sometimes people have no idea how to

4068
02:43:33,570 --> 02:43:40,110
get back from where they went well and

4069
02:43:38,521 --> 02:43:43,351
you can understand often why people

4070
02:43:40,110 --> 02:43:44,610
wouldn't do that right yeah well that's

4071
02:43:43,351 --> 02:43:46,471
a funny thing because one of the things

4072
02:43:44,610 --> 02:43:48,750
Carl Rogers said too about psychotherapy

4073
02:43:46,471 --> 02:43:50,070
is that you can't do psychotherapy with

4074
02:43:48,750 --> 02:43:52,980
someone who hasn't recognized that they

4075
02:43:50,070 --> 02:43:54,391
have a problem so that it's a massive

4076
02:43:52,980 --> 02:43:55,950
thing to recognize that you have a

4077
02:43:54,391 --> 02:43:59,760
problem and it does open the door

4078
02:43:55,950 --> 02:44:01,200
perhaps to recovery but it also means

4079
02:43:59,760 --> 02:44:03,570
that you've recognized that you have a

4080
02:44:01,200 --> 02:44:05,311
problem and that can be very very it's

4081
02:44:03,570 --> 02:44:07,021
the desert right you're out of the

4082
02:44:05,311 --> 02:44:08,700
tyranny but you're in the desert and the

4083
02:44:07,021 --> 02:44:10,471
sun's beating down on you and there's no

4084
02:44:08,700 --> 02:44:13,920
necessary reason to presume that you're

4085
02:44:10,471 --> 02:44:18,891
going to survive so think you have

4086
02:44:13,920 --> 02:44:18,891
goodnight and stay thank you all

4087
02:44:22,150 --> 02:44:24,210
you
