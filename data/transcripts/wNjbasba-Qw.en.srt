1
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:17,000
So I'm going to launch right into it. I like this -

2
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,600
- story as well.

3
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,500
This is the story of Noah and the flood and then the tower of babel.

4
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:26,800
Which I think are juxtaposed very interestingly.

5
00:00:27,099 --> 00:00:31,600
The tower of Babel is one of those stories like cain and Abel that's only a few lines long

6
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:37,169
It's like a fragment in some sense although the story of Noah is quite a well-developed narrative

7
00:00:37,300 --> 00:00:38,100
um..

8
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,739
But like the other stories that we've covered

9
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,399
It is relevant at multiple levels of analysis simultaneously and so

10
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:50,039
what I'm going to do to begin with

11
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:52,600
Is to start with some background information

12
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,100
so

13
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,000
some psychological background information.

14
00:00:56,230 --> 00:01:03,700
So that the story makes sense and the first thing that I'd like to I'd like to make a case for is that

15
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,500
the..

16
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:10,559
You - you bring to bear on the world an a-priori perceptual structure

17
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:13,169
And that's really an embodied structure

18
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:19,049
And it's a consequence of the three and a half billion years that you've spent putting your body together

19
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:21,180
Which is a tremendous amount of time. and-

20
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:28,290
Not only your body, but your mind of course because your mind is part of your body and very much embedded within it

21
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:31,109
You know you tend to think that you have your brain in your head

22
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:36,479
And it's sort of floating separate from the rest of your body, but it's not really true you're a tremendous

23
00:01:38,530 --> 00:01:40,530
massive system of

24
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,840
neurons running through your entire body

25
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:48,329
Autonomic small neurons in the autonomic nervous system, then are on the central nervous system

26
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:52,349
So that's a lot of neurons and then your central nervous system of course enables you to

27
00:01:52,780 --> 00:02:00,119
Exercise voluntary control over your musculature and also to receive information from it your brain is really distributed through your body

28
00:02:00,549 --> 00:02:02,938
One of the things you may not know is that

29
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,329
people who are

30
00:02:04,329 --> 00:02:10,348
Paraplegic can walk if you if you suspend them above a treadmill their legs will walk by themselves with no voluntary control

31
00:02:10,349 --> 00:02:15,329
So your spine is capable of quite complex tivity in fact when you walk mostly

32
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:18,719
It's a controlled fall and mostly your spine is doing it and so

33
00:02:19,959 --> 00:02:23,339
So anyways the point of all that is that

34
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:26,220
You don't have a blank slate?

35
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:33,059
Consciousness that's interpreting a world that manifests itself as sacred gated objects in some

36
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:40,589
Straightforward sense you have a built in interpretive system. That's extraordinarily deeply embedded and

37
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:45,149
Invisible because you might think about it as the implicit structure of your unconscious

38
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,899
it's it what it's what gives rise to your conscious experience and

39
00:02:49,299 --> 00:02:54,479
And it presents you with the world that that's one way of thinking about it, and it's a good way of thinking about it

40
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,769
the psychoanalytic way of thinking about it as well as the neuroscientific way of

41
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:04,679
Thinking about it because one of the things that's pretty interesting about modern neuroscientists, especially the top-rate ones

42
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,450
And those are usually the ones that are working on emotions as far as I've been able to tell are are

43
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:15,209
often quite enamored of the pSychoanalyst jacques panksepp was a good example of that because

44
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:20,069
They came to understand that the pSychoanalyst insistence on

45
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:26,970
Underlying unconscious personified motivations was actually an accurate reflection of how the brain worked

46
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:29,849
so to think of yourself as a loose collection of

47
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:33,779
Autonomous spirits, it's governed by some overarching

48
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,289
Identity is a reasonable way of thinking about it

49
00:03:38,019 --> 00:03:39,310
the

50
00:03:39,310 --> 00:03:45,000
Question is or a question arises from that is what is the nature of this a priori?

51
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:47,639
structure that you use to

52
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:53,430
Interpret the world and I think the clearest answer to that is that it's a story

53
00:03:53,739 --> 00:03:58,828
and you live inside the story, and that's very very interesting to me because I

54
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:05,069
Believe I have a couple of videos that lay this out. I believe that

55
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,540
Darwinian presuppositions are

56
00:04:10,569 --> 00:04:15,779
At least as fundamental as newtonian presuppositions. I actually think they're more fundamental and that

57
00:04:17,349 --> 00:04:22,529
The fact that we've evolved story-like structures through which to interpret the world

58
00:04:23,349 --> 00:04:29,879
Indicates to me that there's something deeply true about story like structure. They're true at least insofar as

59
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:33,389
The fact that we've developed them means that here

60
00:04:33,389 --> 00:04:39,538
We are living and that it's taken three and a half billion years to develop them there. They're highly functional and

61
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:46,079
So we don't have much better definition of truth than highly functional you know that that's about as good as it gets

62
00:04:46,389 --> 00:04:51,059
Partly because we're limited creatures, and we don't have on the Siient knowledge

63
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,310
And so the best we can do with our knowledge

64
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:59,130
Generally speaking is to know its functionality and improve it when it fails to work properly

65
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:01,439
I think the scientific method actually does that

66
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,080
and so the fact that we've

67
00:05:04,599 --> 00:05:11,009
Evolved a story like structure through which to interpret the world that's pretty damn interesting it says something fundamental about stories

68
00:05:11,009 --> 00:05:17,759
And it's it's strange in the same way that the fact that we have hemispheric specialization for the known and the unknown

69
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:20,150
or for Chaos and order

70
00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:22,090
order and Chaos, Ori

71
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:24,070
respectively also says something

72
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:29,669
Fundamental about the nature of the world if you assume that you know we've evolved to reflect the structure of the world

73
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:32,880
broadly speaking that's obviously not just the

74
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:37,529
physical structure the atoms and the Molecules, but all of the patterned

75
00:05:38,110 --> 00:05:42,389
manifestations of the physical Molecules as they build structures of increasing

76
00:05:42,729 --> 00:05:48,569
Complexity across time that would include human interactions and all of and political interactions and economic act

77
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:52,049
interactions Familia interactions all of those things that are a

78
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:54,570
very important part of our reality

79
00:05:54,570 --> 00:05:57,029
but perhaps in some sense not as fundamental as

80
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:03,060
the physical attributes that the physicists concentrate on so we live in stories and

81
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:08,250
Also, I want to talk to you a little bit about stories and about their structure

82
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:16,620
Because when you understand a little bit about the structure of stories, then a whole array of things about mythology all of a sudden make

83
00:06:17,349 --> 00:06:21,089
overwhelming Sampson, so useful because what you see is that

84
00:06:21,909 --> 00:06:26,249
Many of the things that are standard occurrences in your life

85
00:06:26,949 --> 00:06:28,949
everyone's like them are

86
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:31,360
portrayed

87
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:38,760
Universally in Mythology and it's very helpful because first of all it d it d isolates you one of the things you learn?

88
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,950
as a clinical psychologist

89
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:45,119
Contre the Anti psychiatrists. Let's say is that

90
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:48,720
Diagnosis is often a relief to people you know

91
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:53,939
There's a problem with being diagnosed because then you might be labeled and then the label can follow you for the rest of your life

92
00:06:53,940 --> 00:07:01,019
And once you're labeled as something then strange things happen around you that so often reinforce that label

93
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:05,640
Maybe you start acting it out more or you dot it as an identity, but there's a flip side of that

94
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,689
which is that the last thing that you ever want to hear when you go see a

95
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:15,179
Physician or psychologist is you know I've never seen a case like yours before

96
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:19,319
right that is not a relief man because if

97
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:27,240
The message is I've never heard anything like what you're telling me the outcome is either going to be not so good for you

98
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,350
or you're not going to get listened to it all right because you're such an anomaly that you're

99
00:07:31,510 --> 00:07:37,859
You're actually your existence is annoying to the integrated knowledge structure of the medical professional that you're attempting to

100
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:39,780
Receive Advice from well

101
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:42,089
It's definitely the case because they you know

102
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:47,940
If you can be put in a box then the box tells the doctor what to do with you?

103
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,870
And that's actually a relief to the doctor

104
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:54,299
But also a relief to you right because you want to know so you come and you say look I?

105
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:57,959
Can't go out of my house much anymore. I'm afraid on elevators

106
00:07:58,390 --> 00:08:02,279
I have heart palpitations as I sometimes they end up in the emergency room

107
00:08:02,919 --> 00:08:04,919
increasingly my

108
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,110
Interactions in the World are restricted

109
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:13,620
I find myself staying at home afraid I'm going to died of a heart attack and the psychologist says well, you have a agoraphobia

110
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,929
it's like lots of people have that and

111
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:21,780
Here is usually how it develops and here's the treatment course and you know we can probably do something about that, and it's like

112
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:26,820
Well, you're not going to die of a heart attack now. Probably that's a real relief

113
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:32,729
You're not crazy in a completely unique way, and you're crazy in a way that might be

114
00:08:33,310 --> 00:08:37,679
treatable you know and it's such a relief because people come in there with a pile of snakes of

115
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:42,659
Indeterminate magnitude and they walk out with one manageable snake and it's still a snake

116
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:48,538
But you know one manageable snake beats a hydra right so all

117
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:52,679
right so so back back to stories, so

118
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:07,910
the stories that that we tell and that we live in are

119
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:15,739
Fundamentally ways that we deal with the complexity of the world and the fundamental problem with the world

120
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:19,099
As far as I can tell is that not only is it

121
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,900
Complex Beyond your comprehension

122
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,679
But the complexity shifts in unpredictable ways

123
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:27,210
so

124
00:09:27,210 --> 00:09:29,299
That's the Darwinian conundrum actually

125
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,910
that's why Darwinism seems to be a

126
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:33,750
practical Necessity

127
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:38,720
With regards to the continuation of life because because the complexity changes

128
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:46,819
Unpredictably, you can't necessarily tell what's going to work in the future and so the Darwinian process solves that by generating

129
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:48,950
Quasi Random

130
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:51,210
variations and

131
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:57,650
Letting whichever one by happenstance happens to work in that environment survive now. It's not random

132
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:00,350
precisely because

133
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:02,449
The underlying structure is conserved

134
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:07,249
it's very rare that a child would be born with an extra arm or something like that and like the

135
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:10,520
skeletal structure that you inhabit is shared by

136
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:14,059
animals going way way back in evolutionary history

137
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:21,289
There's a lot of conservation and in the evolutionary process, but so there's variation within conservation like music

138
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:23,360
It's a good it's a good way of thinking about it

139
00:10:24,390 --> 00:10:26,390
so

140
00:10:26,730 --> 00:10:28,730
the the

141
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:33,710
Story that we tell have exactly the same structure they have this

142
00:10:35,340 --> 00:10:40,160
Is core element with variations and so alright? I'll turn to the stories and so

143
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:44,539
The first problem as I mentioned is come a complexity problem

144
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:50,900
Things are just too complicated to get a handle on and that actually has serious consequences

145
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:56,090
Because what happens to everyone eventually is that their lives become so complicated that they die?

146
00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:04,099
So and that and many terrible things can happen you on the way to dying as well that are complex complexity

147
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:09,020
related right you can develop a serious illness that you can't get a handle on you can hit a

148
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:16,010
what would you call an impasse in your relationship that you cannot get past and see no way out of

149
00:11:16,339 --> 00:11:19,969
That happens to people quite frequently people who are suicidal for example

150
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:24,680
They often feel like they've been backed into a corner that know that they have no options

151
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,019
They have no good options no matter which way they turn

152
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:30,739
there's something terrible to face and they can't see any way out of it and

153
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:39,259
Sometimes that's more true than you'd like to think because we also tend to like to think that people's problems are primarily psyChological

154
00:11:39,509 --> 00:11:43,399
But they're not now. That's one thing you learn quite rapidly as a clinician

155
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:44,339
is that

156
00:11:44,339 --> 00:11:49,159
Most of the time people don't come to you because they have mental illness they come to you because they have a complexity management

157
00:11:49,410 --> 00:11:52,730
Problem their lives have got out of hand on them

158
00:11:52,730 --> 00:11:58,219
And they don't know how to get them back under control and so all sorts of things can do that

159
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:01,879
And then of course that can make you anxious or depressed it can trigger all sorts of illnesses

160
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:08,419
But the fundamental problem is still that things have got beyond you and that actually has a psychophysiological

161
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:13,819
Cost that isn't merely psychological you have a limited amount of capacity

162
00:12:14,339 --> 00:12:21,409
from from from a resource perspective to deal with emergent complexity it just is just not enough of you, you just

163
00:12:22,499 --> 00:12:24,709
You'll exhaust your psychophysiological

164
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:30,259
Resources if you get into a situation, that's too complex, well, that's what

165
00:12:31,829 --> 00:12:33,629
That's what the idea of Chaos

166
00:12:33,629 --> 00:12:40,339
represents it represents that underlying complexity that can manifest itself at any time and it can manifest itself for example if you're

167
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:45,860
If you wake up in the morning, and you know you feel an ache of some sort and perhaps

168
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:51,589
It's nothing and you ignore it, but it gets worse and you end up going to a hospital and you find out perhaps

169
00:12:52,319 --> 00:12:57,079
For example that you have pancreatic cancer, and you're going to live for six months, and that's the end of that

170
00:12:57,079 --> 00:12:57,779
and

171
00:12:57,779 --> 00:12:58,559
so it's

172
00:12:58,559 --> 00:13:06,049
It's it's it's at that moment that you break through the thin ice that everyone walks on and you see what's underneath and what's underneath

173
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:12,559
Is the in eradicable complexity of life and that's Chaos and that's now

174
00:13:13,079 --> 00:13:15,558
it's taken people a long long time to

175
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:19,399
Get a grip on this conceptual

176
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:23,328
what would you call Conceptual schema and

177
00:13:24,509 --> 00:13:31,219
and human beings have done it mostly with image and story before they've been able to do it in any particulate matter and

178
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:37,999
So there are a set of images that represent this underlying Chaos and one of them is the dragon of Chaos

179
00:13:38,220 --> 00:13:44,329
That that precisely that and that's the dragon that the hero goes out to confront. That's the symbol of the unknown

180
00:13:44,329 --> 00:13:49,998
It's the thing that lurks underneath. It's the thing that also guards treasure because I'm me unknown. There's possibility

181
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:51,869
also, the

182
00:13:51,869 --> 00:13:58,009
Water that that was there we talked about in the mesopotamian creation myth. The water. That's there at the beginning

183
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:04,129
Both the salt and the Fresh water is often a symbol of pre cosmogonic Chaos

184
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:08,360
Often people have dreams for example some of you had this dream

185
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:11,479
I suspect you'll dream that you're in a house that you know well

186
00:14:11,790 --> 00:14:16,610
And all of a sudden you discover a new room or a set of new rooms or maybe a set of rooms in the basement?

187
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:23,839
and often the rooms are not well organized and they're full of water those are very common things and what that means is that you've

188
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,959
broken through the constraints of your

189
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,699
conscious self understanding to a new domain of

190
00:14:33,509 --> 00:14:36,739
Possibility, but a new domain that needs a tremendous amount of work

191
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:39,709
It says well here the new part of you, but it's not well developed

192
00:14:40,439 --> 00:14:45,169
There's it's flooded. It's flooded with Chaos essentially and it's water

193
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:51,079
I think partly because Chaos is not only what you fall into when you're not expecting it

194
00:14:51,079 --> 00:14:56,989
But it's also the unknown that you confront forthrightly and generate new things out of and water is a symbol of life

195
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:02,449
Especially in the desert and of course water life is dependent on water and so water is a natural

196
00:15:03,269 --> 00:15:05,269
symbol to

197
00:15:05,549 --> 00:15:11,209
Utilize when you're talking about something that's life-giving, but also potentially deadly because a little bit of water

198
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:18,379
Well, that's a drink, but a lot of water. That's a shipwreck right and so and those are the those are the extremes now

199
00:15:19,589 --> 00:15:21,509
There are accounts

200
00:15:21,509 --> 00:15:26,209
that are sort of sub texts in genesis, and they all swear in the old testament of

201
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:28,850
God

202
00:15:29,009 --> 00:15:33,079
conquering a great Monster Leviathan or or

203
00:15:34,259 --> 00:15:37,279
Bama that has these sort of serpent isle

204
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,869
Elements and

205
00:15:39,869 --> 00:15:43,879
Making the world at the consequence of that conflict, so there's this idea that

206
00:15:44,389 --> 00:15:50,149
The world creating Force which we've talked about as the logos is the thing that continually confronts?

207
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:55,308
Chaos, and that one way of thinking about Chaos is as a predatory

208
00:15:55,829 --> 00:16:01,308
Reptilian Monster and often one that lives in the depths are perhaps underwater and part of that

209
00:16:01,309 --> 00:16:07,939
I think is because we actually use our predator Detection circuit to do this sort of pre cognitive process and so that the notion

210
00:16:08,249 --> 00:16:14,689
fundamentally is anything that threatens you instantaneously is something that your predator Detection circuit should be working with

211
00:16:15,179 --> 00:16:20,359
It's fast its its spout. It's low resolution. It doesn't have a lot of ideas

212
00:16:21,179 --> 00:16:24,379
but it's really really fast and that also accounts for

213
00:16:25,589 --> 00:16:29,958
capability and tendency to very rapidly treat people who upset our

214
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:33,470
Conceptual structures as

215
00:16:34,889 --> 00:16:39,618
Enemies of the Predatory variety we can fall into that in no time flat?

216
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:46,578
Because it's it's the archetype if something comes along to knock you for a loop. It's a shark

217
00:16:46,579 --> 00:16:50,209
It's something that lurks under the water. It's something that will pull you down. It's an enemy and

218
00:16:51,809 --> 00:16:59,209
And you should get prepared and that's a reasonable defensive strategy even though it also has its dangers and can sometimes be wrong

219
00:17:00,059 --> 00:17:02,899
so the Landscape Within which

220
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:09,559
We have to erect our stories. It's fundamentally one of an

221
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:15,529
Overarching Chaos a Chaos that exceeds our capacity to comprehend in any sense

222
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:19,339
Individually familial socially economically we're always

223
00:17:20,549 --> 00:17:22,939
threatened by the collapse of the structures that we inhabit

224
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:29,329
Constantly we have to work. Well. It's like you own a house. You know how much times has been maintaining a house

225
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,600
Well a lot and why is that is because

226
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:39,470
The house falls apart because you're stupid and the house falls apart well because you do repairs wrong or you ignore things, right?

227
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:44,269
And I'm saying this actually for technical reasons the house falls apart because you're incompetent

228
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,479
But even if you're confident the house falls apart, right?

229
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:51,049
It's just entropy and so things have a proclivity to fall apart on Their own

230
00:17:51,049 --> 00:17:52,830
So you just have to run like mad

231
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:58,160
Just to keep them doing what they're supposed to be doing and then of course that is conflict by your own

232
00:17:58,740 --> 00:18:05,750
Willful blindness and inadequacy as a repair person refusal to attend and all those other things so so that's a very classic

233
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:10,159
idea which will return to one of the ideas that Mircea eliade a--

234
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,270
A

235
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:14,270
famous history of religions

236
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,740
Extracted from a very large corpus of flood

237
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:26,300
Myths was the idea that the earth is periodically flooded for two reasons one is things fall apart

238
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:33,319
Just entropy the straight entropy. It's I don't remember which law of thermodynamics that is but it's one of the big laws of thermodynamics

239
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:37,760
It's one of the top three man things fall apart of their own accord

240
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,750
and that's one of the things that we

241
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:46,250
Have to contend with and then the rate at which things fall apart is sped by the sins of men

242
00:18:46,590 --> 00:18:51,620
That's the other idea and you know that everyone knows that because you know you know

243
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,220
Your car breaks down in the highway you thank God that's so inconvenient

244
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:59,329
And then you you know you shake your fist at the sky and then there's part of you in the back your mind

245
00:18:59,610 --> 00:19:01,610
That goes God you know I?

246
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,219
knew that rattle that I wasn't paying attention to

247
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:09,770
Actually signified something you know and I knew I should have paid attention to it

248
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:14,119
And I didn't and now I'm in the situation that I'm in now, and you know I know I

249
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:17,420
Bet you this happens to people two or three times a week is

250
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:24,439
They do something stupid that they know they shouldn't have done that they told themselves not to do mere seconds before and they know

251
00:19:24,809 --> 00:19:28,009
The boy says don't do that. Yeah. Yeah, you do it

252
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:32,720
You can get nailed for it exactly the way that you knew you would get nailed for it, and then you're hurt

253
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:35,509
Doubly because not only did it fall apart

254
00:19:35,510 --> 00:19:38,749
But you're the idiot that made it fall apart knowing full

255
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:43,910
Well that was going to fall apart and ignoring it and so that's the idea behind the notion that

256
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:46,370
There are two reasons that things fall apart

257
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:55,400
thermodynamic entropy and the proclivity of people not to attend to things they know they should attend to and partly we do that because

258
00:19:55,800 --> 00:20:01,399
If a problem emerges it always announces itself unless it's a really really tiny problem

259
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,559
And you're approaching it Voluntary voluntarily

260
00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:06,559
It always announces itself with negative emotion

261
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:14,269
and that's part of the Predator Detection circuit it announces itself in frustration or disappointment or emotional pain or grief or

262
00:20:14,850 --> 00:20:17,179
the Paramount one anxiety and

263
00:20:17,669 --> 00:20:20,658
and no wonder because it's a problem, right and the

264
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:24,559
Logical one the logical response is it's just sort of freeze in the face of the problem

265
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:27,950
But of course if it's a problem that has to be addressed and solved

266
00:20:28,169 --> 00:20:34,369
Freezing it and turning away from it is not a good solution because since things tend to fall apart on their own accord

267
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:39,739
If you just leave the thing alone that's problematic, it's just going to get worse not better

268
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:43,669
Which is one of the things that's very annoying about life, so for example

269
00:20:43,669 --> 00:20:46,788
You know if you get a warning message from the tax department

270
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,819
the probability that ignoring that

271
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:54,590
Will make it go away is zero right? What will happen instead?

272
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:58,130
Is that the more you ignore it the larger it will grow and if you ignore it long enough

273
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:02,869
Then it will turn into something large enough to eat you and that will be the end of you

274
00:21:03,149 --> 00:21:05,989
I read in Harper's magazine at one point that

275
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:13,069
People would rather be mugged than audited and so I believe that because the mugging man. That's over. It's like a

276
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:15,679
couple of minutes a sheer terror

277
00:21:15,899 --> 00:21:17,899
Lost your wallet the way you walk

278
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:23,899
the audit that's like that's like a semi fatal disease, so

279
00:21:25,649 --> 00:21:27,649
So that's Chaos

280
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:30,589
Now it's the idea here to is that that's the Chaos

281
00:21:31,139 --> 00:21:38,059
That's the psychological idea. Is that that's also the Chaos that whatever is being represented in Genesis as the spirit of God

282
00:21:39,029 --> 00:21:41,209
Extracts order out of at the beginning of time

283
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:48,260
And it's also that which we're constantly contending with as we struggle in the same manner to construct and maintain

284
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:55,700
Habitable worlds, so it's brilliant. It's brilliant. You know when I first put together the relationship between

285
00:21:56,519 --> 00:22:03,379
what iliad II called the pre cosmogonic Chaos and the Predator predatory landscape that surrounded our ancestors and

286
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:09,590
The Manner in which were structured neurologically to respond to all of that. I thought it was it was like an

287
00:22:10,110 --> 00:22:13,549
Amazing epiphany because it's self-evidently the case

288
00:22:13,889 --> 00:22:18,949
That the world is too complicated for us to deal with and that's one of the problems that we face on an ongoing

289
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:24,350
basis, and then the question is well, what do you do about that and if you ignore it it gets worse, so

290
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:28,520
Laurene it doesn't work, and so we know what doesn't work and so if ignoring

291
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:31,249
It doesn't work then attending to it might work

292
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:38,179
and then I found out with the egyptians for example that horus was the god of the tension and the same thing happened among the

293
00:22:38,429 --> 00:22:42,439
Mesopotamians with far duck and his ring of eyes. It's like. What's the way to?

294
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:48,620
Forestall the catastrophe of things falling apart and the answer to that is by attending to them

295
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:52,969
voluntarily attending to them and that slots very nicely into the hero mythology that

296
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:58,429
Promotes the idea that if there's a dragon in the whereabouts in

297
00:22:59,010 --> 00:23:06,140
In the near in the neighborhood let's say that hiding in the basement. Just makes it grow larger

298
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,620
it's time to go out and

299
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:13,729
confront the damn thing and the general stories are as well you might get killed because it's a dragon but

300
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:20,359
It's only might as opposed to definitely will get killed if it happens to attack you at 3 in the morning

301
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:23,510
At home when you're hungover, and it's been a bad day

302
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:27,650
And you don't have your you know art your sword and your shield at the ready

303
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:33,830
Which is generally what happens to people who avoid things so it's not something that should be recommended

304
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:37,459
You're screwed both ways that's one of the things that's so nice about

305
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:42,469
Being deeply pessimistic. It's so freeing because one of the things

306
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:49,309
Well, it's very frequent it's such a relief and it's really a useful habit to develop is

307
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:56,750
Sometimes no matter what you do you're in trouble, and that's a relief because then you can stop scrabbling around for the way out

308
00:23:56,750 --> 00:24:00,439
There's no way out man. It's like you can pick murder

309
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:07,609
you know wretched death a or slightly less wretched death be something like that and and I know that's a

310
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:14,840
Terrible way of looking at things, but it is extraordinarily useful to understand that many times you get your choice

311
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,900
boils down to picking the least bad option

312
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:23,179
And if that's all you can do if that's what how life is revealing itself to you

313
00:24:23,179 --> 00:24:28,999
It's like well more power to you the least bad option that's the best you can do and and and it's good enough

314
00:24:29,370 --> 00:24:33,199
especially compared to the alternative which is the most bad option so

315
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:36,780
All right now

316
00:24:37,870 --> 00:24:44,370
So the fundamental reality of things is complexity beyond comprehension, and then the question is well

317
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:48,210
how is it that you manage that and partly you manage that and this is where the

318
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:55,710
Image of the patriarchal order comes in in the positive Manner. I might point out because in the absence of

319
00:24:56,230 --> 00:25:03,419
patriarchal structure for lack of a better Lexicon there's nothing but Chaos and I wouldn't recommend Chaos because it's

320
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:10,320
It there's a lot of it and there isn't that much of you and if you think you can handle it without an a priori

321
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:15,869
Structure and without a sociological structure surrounding you then you don't know anything at all about human beings

322
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,509
Because one of the things I've noticed for example is that

323
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:22,030
It's it's unbelievable

324
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:27,960
The degree to which our sanity depends on a functioning sociological structure and here's why?

325
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,830
Well first of all

326
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:35,189
You kind of need to know what to do every day you have to have a routine because you're an animal you know on you

327
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:39,480
Know if you have a dog or a cat dogs are really good example this dogs like routine

328
00:25:39,490 --> 00:25:45,240
they like to be walked the number of times a day that they're supposed to be walked and they get quite sick very rapidly if

329
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,240
You don't if you don't

330
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:54,360
Routinize they're they're days children are exactly the same way now you can overdo it right, but still you know you need to know

331
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:58,290
Approximately when you should get up should be approximately the same every day

332
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:02,730
You need to know approximately you're going when you're going to eat. You need to know what you're going to eat

333
00:26:02,730 --> 00:26:08,009
You need to know who you're going to eat with you need to know where to buy your food. It's like 80% of your life

334
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:10,710
70% of your life something like that

335
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:14,939
Consists of those things that you do every single day that you repeat

336
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:19,769
And those are often the things that people think about as the trivial elements of their life

337
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:23,999
But one of the things I would like to point out to you if you do the mathematics I

338
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:29,519
Did this with a client of mine who was having hard time putting his child to bed?

339
00:26:29,530 --> 00:26:34,470
They were having a fight every night and I knew by that time the studies indicate that

340
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:39,360
Most parents only spend 20 minutes per day of one-on-one time with their child

341
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:42,780
Now the reason for that is that people are busy

342
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:48,780
And it's actually not that easy to parse out 20 minutes of one-on-one time. It's a lot bloody more time than you think

343
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:51,569
But that's all there is 20 minutes

344
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:57,630
He is spending like 40 minutes a day fighting with this kid trying to get the kid to go to bed, and that's not very

345
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,730
Entertaining you know you think was just having a scrap with the Keita both going to bed

346
00:27:02,730 --> 00:27:07,770
But it's no no no no if it happens every day. It's a catastrophe. So you do the math

347
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:14,669
So we'll say five hours a week for the sake of argument just to keep it simple. It's 20 hours a month. It's

348
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:17,760
240 hours a year. That's six

349
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:25,679
40-hour work weeks that guy was basically spending a month and a half of work weeks doing absolutely nothing, but having a wretched time

350
00:27:26,470 --> 00:27:29,039
Fighting with his son trying to get him to go to bed

351
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:36,300
Horrible right that's just way too much time to spend doing something like that if you want to actually have a positive

352
00:27:36,550 --> 00:27:41,550
Relationship with someone because it's just too. It's just too punishing and so

353
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:49,589
well, so you need structure you need predictability and you need more of it than you think just to keep you saying now if you're

354
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:52,980
lucky and and maybe a bit odd you can deviate

355
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:57,419
5% from the norm or 10% from the norm or something like that

356
00:27:58,210 --> 00:27:59,410
carefully and cautiously

357
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:04,829
as long as the rest of you is all well ordered in a normative manner you might be able to get away with that and

358
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:09,330
You might be able to sustain it across time and people might be able to tolerate you if you do it

359
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:12,179
Or maybe you'll get really lucky and you happen to be creative

360
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:16,169
But reasonably well put together and people will actually be happy that there's something

361
00:28:16,810 --> 00:28:21,690
Idiosyncratic and unique about you, but even under those circumstances mostly what you want is to?

362
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:28,080
Have a routine. It's discipline its predictable and bloody well stick to it. You're going to be way

363
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:31,530
Healthier and happier and saner if you do that

364
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:36,509
And then the other thing that you need because this is one of the things the pSychoanalyst thought wrong

365
00:28:36,510 --> 00:28:39,449
I think is that they overestimated the degree to which

366
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:42,299
Sanity was a consequence of internal

367
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:45,390
Being properly structured internally you know

368
00:28:46,150 --> 00:28:48,900
Because from the psychoanalytic point of view you're sort of an ego

369
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:54,269
And that ego is inside you of course it rests on an unconscious structure, but the purpose of pSychoanalysis

370
00:28:54,850 --> 00:29:01,339
Is to sort out that unconscious structure and the ego on top of it and to make you a fully an autonomous?

371
00:29:01,830 --> 00:29:04,189
individual but there's a problem with that because

372
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:09,019
The reason that you're saying as a fully

373
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:15,109
Functional and on Thomas human being isn't because you've organized your psyche even though that's important

374
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:18,589
The reason that you're saying if you're a wit

375
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:23,600
If you have a well organized unconscious an ego is because other people can tolerate having you around

376
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:30,080
For reasonably extensive periods of time and will cuff you across the back of the head every time you do something so stupid

377
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:33,649
That people will dislike you permanently if you continue

378
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:38,629
And so what people are doing to each other all the time just non-stop is

379
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:42,469
Broadcasting sanity signals back and forth right?

380
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:47,240
It's like you smile at people if they're well if they're not not only behaving properly

381
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,849
But behaving in a way that you would like to see them

382
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:56,060
Continue to behave you frown at them if they're not you ignore them if they're not you shun them you you roll your eyes at

383
00:29:56,060 --> 00:30:02,269
Them you manifest a disgust face you don't listen to them you interrupt them you won't cooperate with them. You won't compete with them

384
00:30:02,270 --> 00:30:06,650
it's like you're blasting signals at other people about how to regulate their behavior, so

385
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:10,999
Frequently, well it just makes up all of your social interaction

386
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:16,100
That's why we face each other and we have emotional displays on our face and we're looking at each other's eyes

387
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:20,630
And we know exactly we know as much as we can about what's going on with each other

388
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:24,170
Given that we don't have immediate access to the contents of their consciousness

389
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:31,550
And so partly what you're doing with your routine is establishing yourself as a credible reliable trustworthy

390
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:37,099
Potentially interesting human being who isn't going to do anything too erratic at any moment

391
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:42,110
And everyone else is around there tapping you into shape making sure that that's exactly what you are

392
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:45,500
And that's how you stay sane, and so what happens to people, too

393
00:30:45,500 --> 00:30:52,339
If they don't have a routine and they get isolated as they start to drift and they drift badly because the world is too

394
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:56,419
Complicated for you to keep it organized all by yourself

395
00:30:56,420 --> 00:31:02,180
You just cannot do it so a lot of our so we outsource the problem of Sanity

396
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:06,169
and it's very intelligent that we outsource the problem of sanity because

397
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:10,250
Sanity is an impossibly complex problem and

398
00:31:10,770 --> 00:31:13,699
So the way that we manage the incredibly complex

399
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:19,850
We have a very large number of brains working simultaneously on the problem all the time

400
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:25,909
It's like a stock market for sanity, and it's partly I use that I use that definition

401
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:33,289
With purpose because the stock market does the same kind of impossible thing right because it tries to price things which is impossible

402
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:38,240
There's how many things are there like a billion how in the world do you decide?

403
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,829
What the price is you can't decide what the price is that's why you have a stock market?

404
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:44,750
as well in the free market

405
00:31:44,750 --> 00:31:49,130
I mean for for consumer goods is everyone's voting on what the price of everything is all the time

406
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:52,819
That's the way we figure it out because it's actually it's technically impossible

407
00:31:53,070 --> 00:31:59,210
That's partly why the stock market explodes now and then and there's bubbles and all that sort of thing, but anyways the point is

408
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:03,330
things are chaotic

409
00:32:03,330 --> 00:32:06,470
In Ellis in Wonderland When Ellis goes down the rabbit hole

410
00:32:07,380 --> 00:32:09,380
That's the underworld right

411
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:12,559
So now she's gone into the sub structure of being

412
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:19,100
And she meets the red queen and the red queen is mother nature and mother nature is running around

413
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,890
Yelling off with her heads off with their heads

414
00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:26,809
Which is of course what mother nature does and she tailed Ellis in?

415
00:32:27,270 --> 00:32:31,099
My kingdom you have to run as fast as you can just to stay in the same place

416
00:32:31,770 --> 00:32:34,369
and that's exactly right, and that's a description of

417
00:32:35,250 --> 00:32:42,500
In fact evolutionary biologists I call just picked up on that phrase they call it the red queen problem, and the Red queen problem is

418
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:47,419
Everything's after you all the time, and you're not smart enough to do anything about it

419
00:32:47,690 --> 00:32:54,110
Ord enough about and so that's a permanent existential problem. So how do you deal with that you've got a biological structure

420
00:32:54,750 --> 00:33:00,020
so your embodiment is part of the solution to the problem, and then your enculturated and

421
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:02,760
Because you're enculturated

422
00:33:02,760 --> 00:33:08,059
you're taught a lot of things that you need to know but mostly what you're taught is how to communicate with other people in an

423
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:08,780
acceptable Manner

424
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:15,560
And then once you can communicate with people in an acceptable manner then you can outsource your problems constantly

425
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,560
But you're doing constantly and so we're in this

426
00:33:18,150 --> 00:33:22,639
continual Dynamic exchange of problem-solving, so if you're a socialized person

427
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:27,049
That's what you get access to and that's something to know if you're going to have kids and I mentioned

428
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,840
I think in a previous lecture

429
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:33,959
The pert the purpose of being a parent for very young children is to make your children

430
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:42,839
Exceptionally socially desirable by the age of four because if you can do that, they're set because everyone

431
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:47,339
Wants them around and as soon as everybody wants them around they want to play with them

432
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:49,470
They want to cooperate when they want to compete with them

433
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:51,750
It's like the door is open the door is open

434
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:57,540
And they stay saying because they've got all sorts of people who actually like them that are helping them out and so that's your goal

435
00:33:57,540 --> 00:34:04,559
Is to make them as socially acceptable as you possibly can socially desirable as you possibly can and that doesn't mean

436
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:07,120
You render them

437
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:11,010
obedient without spirit right that's that's a tyrants motive of

438
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:19,260
Enforcing social acceptability it's like never do anything wrong. Well that's not any way to I mean that's a good piece of advice

439
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,260
you know like but

440
00:34:21,429 --> 00:34:26,939
It's missing the other half which is do a bunch of things that are right so that so that people are

441
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:32,429
thrilled to have you around and to and encourage that that's what you want to do as a parent as well as

442
00:34:32,919 --> 00:34:36,539
Inculcating the order and so you know one in this little diagram

443
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:41,999
I indicated that there's God the father with the sun behind him and he's ruling over this walled City

444
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:44,850
So he's like the metis spirit of the walled City

445
00:34:45,669 --> 00:34:49,859
It's very very nice very nice image Brilliant image

446
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:56,039
So it is the collective spirit of the city that's another way of thinking about it or the collective spirit of the city

447
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,889
across time or the collective spirit of the

448
00:34:59,110 --> 00:35:03,419
Force that built and maintained the City across time even better

449
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:09,480
and that's associated with the sun because it's a it's it's it's associated with enlightenment and

450
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:16,169
illumination and all of those things that we associate with higher consciousness and vision it's a brilliant image and then I

451
00:35:16,570 --> 00:35:18,809
overlaid this so now of course the

452
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:20,980
patriarchal

453
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:22,480
aspect of

454
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,480
existence can become tyrannical

455
00:35:24,550 --> 00:35:30,060
It does that quite regularly? It's one of the existential dangers of human civilizations that

456
00:35:30,610 --> 00:35:32,909
Civilization is a medication for Chaos

457
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:38,399
But it can spin out of control in and of itself and become its own sort of problem

458
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:45,510
Which is like a hyper order problem which then produces a Chaos problem, so every solution carries within it?

459
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:50,429
Certain problems right because no solution is perfect and so you have to keep things in balance

460
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,800
But it's one of the reasons that I'm really

461
00:35:54,430 --> 00:35:58,619
Let's call it irritated about the postmodernists because they keep

462
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:03,030
yammering about the patriarchy and it's very very annoying because

463
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:10,740
Because it's self-evident that social structures are tyrannical. It's like that's not news folks

464
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:18,449
That's obvious, but that's not all they are and it's it's there. It's the reduction of the entire

465
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:21,220
complex

466
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:27,330
Solution let's say to a unit dimensional problem. It's just Thai tyranny. It's like no actually

467
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:31,830
It's not just tyranny if you spent six months somewhere. That was just tyranny

468
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:36,119
You'd know the difference very very rapidly and that doesn't mean that everyone

469
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:41,519
Doesn't give up a pound or two or ten or Twenty a flesh to

470
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:49,560
Participate even in the society that's as free as at western Society is we all get crushed and molded by the Tyrannical Force of social

471
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:50,950
convention

472
00:36:50,950 --> 00:36:52,950
but at least in principle

473
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:59,669
The benefit is worth the cost and then it's also up to you to make sure that you don't sacrifice more to the group

474
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:03,480
than you should and you can start to tell if you're

475
00:37:03,820 --> 00:37:08,820
Sacrificing more to the group than you should because you start to become resentful of other people. That's part of them

476
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:13,289
That's part of the psychological mechanism. That's informing you of that, so it's up to you to fight

477
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:20,850
Against you know the overarching pressure for conformity to retain your individual logos. Let's say

478
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:25,560
But that's sort of your problem. It's like the group wants you to behave

479
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:28,260
now if you could behave and be

480
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:31,889
Creatively productive so much the better, but that's pretty damn rare

481
00:37:31,890 --> 00:37:38,160
So the group generally tends to settle just for behave, and there's a tyrannical element of that

482
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,160
But what the hell is the alternative?

483
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:46,739
it's you know our society is based on consensus and the consensus is based on the sacrifice of a

484
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:53,369
Certain sacrifice of individuality even though individuality is absolutely necessary as a revitalizing force

485
00:37:53,609 --> 00:37:57,869
The society it's a very tight touch tough thing to manage properly so anyways

486
00:37:58,599 --> 00:38:00,130
you have

487
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:06,660
The your physiological structure as your first line of ordering in relationship to Chaos because your body

488
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:09,269
Presents you with the world in a certain way

489
00:38:09,269 --> 00:38:14,758
and then the second line of defense is something like the sociological structure that you can have it we could call those the

490
00:38:14,950 --> 00:38:17,220
competency Hierarchies or something like that and

491
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:22,829
Thank God for them because you know maybe you're going to be able to specialize in one or two things in your life

492
00:38:22,829 --> 00:38:23,609
or five things

493
00:38:23,609 --> 00:38:28,889
But there's 300 things you need to know and if it's just you you know you'll be doing your genius level

494
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:33,839
Mathematics while your bath tub is leaking all over your all over your bathroom floor

495
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:36,869
And that's not so good so you can call a plumber and hooray for that?

496
00:38:36,869 --> 00:38:40,679
So you know we tend to cooperate to keep Chaos under control?

497
00:38:40,809 --> 00:38:45,538
And we tend to cooperate to keep order under control and that's the political

498
00:38:46,059 --> 00:38:47,769
dialogue right

499
00:38:47,769 --> 00:38:51,779
you maintain the culture to keep Chaos under control and we

500
00:38:52,569 --> 00:38:58,349
Balance the cultural property to keep the culture under control and that way we get to live

501
00:38:59,109 --> 00:39:03,298
Reasonably peacefully reasonably productively for a reasonable amount of time

502
00:39:03,339 --> 00:39:09,479
And that's the best that we can do and we should have some gratitude when that's working because the default

503
00:39:10,089 --> 00:39:12,089
condition of

504
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:13,720
Things is

505
00:39:13,720 --> 00:39:18,989
That not only do they not work very well they work worse and worse over time all by themselves

506
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:23,069
So anytime anything is working. You should just be amazed by it

507
00:39:24,759 --> 00:39:27,149
All right, so what does the frame look like well?

508
00:39:27,150 --> 00:39:30,900
I think it looks something like this, and this is as far as I can tell this is the bare-bones

509
00:39:31,509 --> 00:39:37,079
This is the bare bones of a variety of things it's a bear bowling story. It's a bear bowling conceptual framework

510
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:41,189
It's a bear bowling design to speak in High Daguerreian terms

511
00:39:41,190 --> 00:39:45,539
It's like it's the bare bones world that you live in you're always in one of these worlds

512
00:39:45,539 --> 00:39:47,259
There's no getting out of them

513
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:52,109
You can move from one to another but you're always in a world like this, and so this is the world that you're in

514
00:39:53,049 --> 00:39:54,880
You're somewhere

515
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:58,200
Because you have to be somewhere now you might not know where that is

516
00:39:58,539 --> 00:40:05,488
which means that somewhere that you are is chaotic in which case you need to go over your past in Great detail and

517
00:40:05,739 --> 00:40:11,669
Figure out where you are so you're lost right here. You're lost and the problem with being lost is when you're lost

518
00:40:11,740 --> 00:40:15,780
You don't know where to go and the problem with not knowing where to go is there's a million places

519
00:40:15,849 --> 00:40:22,619
That you could go and a million places is too many places for you to go without dying so being lost is not good

520
00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:24,619
So you need to know where you are?

521
00:40:24,910 --> 00:40:28,049
One of the things that we built online my partners

522
00:40:28,049 --> 00:40:32,939
and I have this program called past authoring that helps people lay out the

523
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:41,520
narrative of their past to identify to break their life down into six stages epochs we call them and then to identify the

524
00:40:42,849 --> 00:40:47,519
Emotionally significant moments in each epoch and to write them out what happened negatively

525
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:52,979
What happened positively what the consequences were what do you derive from it perhaps what you could have done differently?

526
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:58,470
Perhaps what you learn from it all of that, so that you can narrow in zero in on

527
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:00,789
determining precisely

528
00:41:00,789 --> 00:41:02,760
Where it is that you are right now?

529
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:09,209
and people are often loath to do that because they actually don't want to know they'd rather be spread out in a sort of

530
00:41:10,809 --> 00:41:12,809
half-Blind Manner in the fog

531
00:41:13,630 --> 00:41:20,940
Hoping that the place that they're at is better than it really is and deluding themselves by remaining vague than to figure out

532
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:23,669
I'm right here right now with these specific problems

533
00:41:23,770 --> 00:41:29,069
But it's actually better to do that because if you have a set of specific problems

534
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:34,979
And you've really narrowed them down and really specified them then you could probably start fixing them and you can start

535
00:41:35,799 --> 00:41:37,630
Fixing them in Mike

536
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:41,250
Microwaves bit by bit, but there's no way you can do that without knowing where you are

537
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:44,819
It's impossible, and you can kind of tell if you don't know where you are

538
00:41:45,099 --> 00:41:50,909
it's quite straightforward if you are haunted by reveries of the past

539
00:41:52,029 --> 00:41:54,029
for events that are older than

540
00:41:54,069 --> 00:41:59,219
Approximately eighteen months if they continue to come up in your mind over and over and your dreams over and over

541
00:42:00,369 --> 00:42:04,649
You haven't extracted the world out from your past

542
00:42:05,049 --> 00:42:06,910
experiences the Potential is still

543
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:13,859
Trapped in the past and to confront the potential means to confront the dragon of the past and of course that's terrifying

544
00:42:14,069 --> 00:42:16,709
And it seems seriously be terrifying so for example

545
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:18,180
Maybe your vague

546
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:21,909
And ill-formed and ill-defined because you will be used her dad when you were a child

547
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,680
Four years old something like that

548
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:27,850
and maybe R abused by a family member because that's generally who does the abusing and

549
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:32,439
so that just makes it works, and then what that means is that you've got a

550
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:37,330
implicit you had an implicit encounter with Malevolent evil

551
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:42,310
That know you've had a direct encounter with Malevolent evil, but you have an implicit

552
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:46,630
Hypothesis of Malevolent Evil that's plaguing you. It's still there

553
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:54,069
it's trapped in the memories right it's trapped in the representational structure and as an adult you're now faced with the necessity of

554
00:42:54,440 --> 00:42:58,060
Articulating that fully before you have any chance whatsoever of freeing yourself from it

555
00:42:58,060 --> 00:43:02,649
And so that's no joke lots of times people have to go into the past. That's what this I grant lists do and

556
00:43:02,780 --> 00:43:08,679
Say and say look here is something came along. Just bloody well knocked me over, and it isn't even that

557
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,930
I repressed it which which I think was

558
00:43:11,810 --> 00:43:18,100
We will talk about freud's errors because freud was a genius. So we'll just leave him alone but but sometimes it's not repression

559
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:24,370
It's just the terrible things happen to people at such a young age that there isn't a bloody chance in hell that they can figure

560
00:43:24,370 --> 00:43:27,729
out why they happen or what to do with them or what they mean and

561
00:43:27,860 --> 00:43:31,089
Then you can carry that with you, and you carry it with you. It's like

562
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:38,979
Here your your body encounters the world in two stages, and it happens very rapidly well it can extend over years

563
00:43:38,980 --> 00:43:41,980
but the initial stage has happened very rapidly so for example if

564
00:43:42,230 --> 00:43:46,959
You're walking down the road and you hear a large noise be a loud noise. Behind you go like this

565
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,080
That's a predator defense response by the way you crouch down

566
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:54,699
And that's to stop something from jumping on your back and getting at your neck too easily

567
00:43:54,830 --> 00:43:57,549
That's like a few million two hundred milliseconds

568
00:43:57,550 --> 00:44:00,189
it's really fast or even faster than that and it better be because

569
00:44:00,590 --> 00:44:06,489
Something like a snake like will say it can nail. You just right now. So you better be fast, but it's low resolution

570
00:44:06,490 --> 00:44:10,600
It's like danger. Snake something like that or danger predatory cap

571
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:15,159
it's that fast and then you can unravel that and

572
00:44:16,670 --> 00:44:20,020
Categorize it, but that takes time you do that with emotion

573
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:25,630
And then you do it with cognition you can do that with long term thinking you know because maybe you've encountered someone specifically

574
00:44:25,790 --> 00:44:28,719
Malevolent and predatory at work that happens to people a lot

575
00:44:29,619 --> 00:44:35,498
as a as a destructive bully and who seems to have no positive function whatsoever and

576
00:44:36,289 --> 00:44:41,229
Is only living that out and then you you know you don't know what to do about it? So you're you're in

577
00:44:41,779 --> 00:44:45,429
Prey mode, I don't mean this kind of mode although that would help too

578
00:44:45,499 --> 00:44:50,919
But I mean you're acting like a prey animal and then you have this terribly complex thing to decompose

579
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:55,059
Which is what the hell's up with this person? Why are they making my life miserable?

580
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:58,629
What is it about me that allows them to make my life miserable?

581
00:44:58,990 --> 00:45:06,069
That's a nasty little road to walk down, and you're stuck with having to you're stuck with having to decompose it. Maybe you can't maybe

582
00:45:07,099 --> 00:45:15,008
Formulating an explicit philosophy of good and evil to deal with something malevolent in your environment actually just happens to be

583
00:45:15,349 --> 00:45:16,670
Beyond you and

584
00:45:16,670 --> 00:45:21,759
That could easily be it's certainly the case for people who are young and it's the case for plenty of adults as well

585
00:45:21,759 --> 00:45:23,829
It's no simple thing to math to manage

586
00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:30,459
It's something to that often soldiers who have post-traumatic stress disorder have to do because they've encountered terrible things

587
00:45:30,460 --> 00:45:32,359
Maybe they're dunham or ran into them

588
00:45:32,359 --> 00:45:39,969
They need to update their moral model of the world or if they end up in something close enough closely approximating hell

589
00:45:42,559 --> 00:45:44,559
Anyway, so you need to know where you are

590
00:45:45,170 --> 00:45:51,399
That's this what is where are you so you're navigating your navigator. You're a sailor on an ocean man

591
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:55,389
That's what that's what you are you're a mobile creature. You're going from point a to point B

592
00:45:55,390 --> 00:46:01,299
All the time you know it's sitting there glued to a rock like some brainless. You know sea creature

593
00:46:01,299 --> 00:46:06,909
There's a funny little creature called a hydra very simple Little creature in its Juvenile stage

594
00:46:06,910 --> 00:46:08,739
It has a brain because it swims around

595
00:46:08,739 --> 00:46:13,569
but then when it turns into an adult it latches itself to Iraq and promptly

596
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:16,449
digests its brain because if you're just sitting on a rock

597
00:46:16,450 --> 00:46:19,689
And you're not moving you don't need a brain so but that's not our issue, right?

598
00:46:19,690 --> 00:46:26,289
We're resuming in the world, and so we're navigating agents, so to navigate if there's two things you need to know

599
00:46:27,049 --> 00:46:32,079
The first is where the hell. Are you exactly precisely right razorsharp?

600
00:46:32,989 --> 00:46:37,149
What's good about you and what's bad about you by your own by your own reckoning

601
00:46:37,150 --> 00:46:42,549
You don't have to you can ask other people, but this is a game you play yourself. It's like as far as I'm concerned

602
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:45,989
I'm taking start. What is it that's okay about me

603
00:46:45,990 --> 00:46:49,260
And what needs some work and you go to watch to not be too?

604
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:53,909
Self-Critical when you're doing that too because that can just be another kind of flaw and then the next is okay

605
00:46:53,910 --> 00:46:55,180
Well, where are you going?

606
00:46:55,180 --> 00:46:57,160
What's your destination?

607
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:59,339
Well, and that's what the frame is now

608
00:46:59,339 --> 00:47:01,829
You know you could do that in a very sophisticated way

609
00:47:01,830 --> 00:47:07,199
And you do that by thinking consciously about who it is that you are in an articulated Manner

610
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:08,310
And where you want to go?

611
00:47:08,310 --> 00:47:10,109
And why and how you're going to get there?

612
00:47:10,109 --> 00:47:16,169
And people hardly ever do that that is that's come as such an absolute shock to me as an educator. I

613
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:21,389
Just because one of the other programs I use this in my classes

614
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:26,070
What are the other programs in this suite of programs is called the future authoring program?

615
00:47:26,070 --> 00:47:26,800
and I

616
00:47:26,800 --> 00:47:32,729
Started developing it my maps of meaning class which is where some of this materials from and I got students to write about their past

617
00:47:32,730 --> 00:47:34,150
It's like okay

618
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:39,810
We're talking about stories, so let's tell your story. Who are you how do you get here? What are you now that?

619
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:44,669
Usually helps people put things to rest although, it's quite stressful

620
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:50,849
Well, you're doing it stress goes up when you're doing it and maybe you feel miserable for a couple of weeks

621
00:47:50,849 --> 00:47:52,889
And then stress goes down and it stays down

622
00:47:52,890 --> 00:47:57,359
So that's and that's also why people don't do it because who the hell wants to have their stress go up

623
00:47:57,580 --> 00:47:59,639
But if it's temporary it's a sacrifice

624
00:48:00,339 --> 00:48:04,499
So then the next issue is well. Where are you going and one of the things that and this?

625
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:10,649
I just still I cannot understand is students that have been in education system for 15 years

626
00:48:10,990 --> 00:48:15,810
14 Years high end students most of them not once in their whole bloody life

627
00:48:16,089 --> 00:48:19,889
Did anyone ever get them to sit down for like a day and say alright?

628
00:48:20,830 --> 00:48:22,830
justify your existence

629
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:26,489
It's like well seriously it's like here. You are in University

630
00:48:26,490 --> 00:48:30,089
You're taking a bunch of courses you've got some sort of vague Career plan

631
00:48:30,089 --> 00:48:37,529
It's like defend the damn thing a bit since you're going to go live it and everything you're staking everything on it

632
00:48:37,530 --> 00:48:42,989
it's like what's your damn plan, and why are you so convinced that it's not the plan of a

633
00:48:43,780 --> 00:48:47,129
Babbling fool because if you haven't thought about it

634
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:50,220
Then it is and if you really want to go out there and live that out

635
00:48:50,349 --> 00:48:55,588
You know one of the things carl jung said was that you you're in a story whether you know it or not

636
00:48:56,250 --> 00:48:59,489
And and then he made two nice comments about that

637
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:06,059
if it's someone else's story, you're probably going to get a bit part and it might not be the one you want and

638
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:11,639
If it's a story that you don't know it might be one with a really bad ending or maybe it's just bad

639
00:49:11,800 --> 00:49:15,719
Period with a worse ending and if you don't know what the story that you're living out is

640
00:49:16,090 --> 00:49:18,299
Maybe that's the one you know

641
00:49:18,300 --> 00:49:22,349
maybe you got that from your mother you got it from your grandmother you got it from your aunt or

642
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:24,390
God only knows where you picked it up

643
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:30,270
Because you pick up things like mad because that's what human beings are like so maybe you're living a malevolent tragedy

644
00:49:30,849 --> 00:49:32,109
unconsciously and

645
00:49:32,109 --> 00:49:36,449
Then one thing you might ask yourself is well. How wretched and miserable is your life

646
00:49:36,690 --> 00:49:42,300
Let's had futile to that. How wretched miserable and futile is your life, and you might say well

647
00:49:42,300 --> 00:49:46,080
Yeah, seventy percent on each count it's like then you're probably

648
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:49,440
unconsciously living out a malevolent tragedy and

649
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:52,140
Maybe that's not for the best

650
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:58,499
it's either that or the whole universe hates you right or 70 percent hates you you know so

651
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:01,199
So anyways, you know we got students to start

652
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:05,230
writing in detail about

653
00:50:05,230 --> 00:50:08,369
Not what they wanted, it's not a career thing

654
00:50:08,890 --> 00:50:14,070
Because that's the closest people usually get is they have a career plan. It's like no, no, it's not a career plan

655
00:50:14,070 --> 00:50:20,879
That's that's peripheral important, but peripheral it's like all right you got three years man. You're going to live them anyways

656
00:50:22,540 --> 00:50:27,089
Devote those three years to setting the world up around you so that it's the best it could possibly be

657
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:33,089
For you as if you were taking care of yourself as if you cared for yourself

658
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:39,359
Well, what would that look like you know let's say just for the sake of argument if you figured out where you work that you

659
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:41,359
Could have what would be best for you?

660
00:50:42,130 --> 00:50:44,369
Well, what is that I bet?

661
00:50:45,910 --> 00:50:47,910
You never asked

662
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:51,209
People don't ask and so life comes out them

663
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:59,519
Like Random snakes and they sort of fend them off and life goes by and things don't work out the way people expected them to

664
00:50:59,770 --> 00:51:02,729
But a huge part of that is they didn't know where they were

665
00:51:03,430 --> 00:51:10,109
but they wouldn't look or didn't know that they should look ignorant willful blindness right two great catastrophes and

666
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,869
They never figured out where they wanted to go or why?

667
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:16,109
Now there's a problem with figure out where you want to go

668
00:51:16,720 --> 00:51:21,030
And the problem is is that you make your conditions for failure clear to yourself and people?

669
00:51:21,730 --> 00:51:24,929
Don't like that, so if you keep yourself in the fog

670
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:30,929
Then you can't tell when you screwed up now that isn't so good because you're still screwing up. You're just too

671
00:51:31,510 --> 00:51:34,619
blind self blind to notice although in

672
00:51:35,109 --> 00:51:42,299
The short term not less painful if you make your criteria for success razor-sharp then you know every time you screw up

673
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:45,090
But that's great because then you could fix it you could either

674
00:51:47,260 --> 00:51:49,260
repair the the

675
00:51:49,630 --> 00:51:54,720
Behavioral it adequacy, or the conceptual inadequacy that you're using as a tool in that situation

676
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:59,699
Or maybe you could adjust your dam plan either way, you can fix it and so

677
00:52:00,670 --> 00:52:02,670
Okay, so you're living in one of these

678
00:52:02,830 --> 00:52:04,690
Bloody things and

679
00:52:04,690 --> 00:52:09,090
You might as well it seems to me you might as well make it the best one you could live in because

680
00:52:09,310 --> 00:52:11,310
You don't have anything better to do

681
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:18,449
Now if you don't do that, if you don't do it consciously, and this is what the pSychoanalyst pointed out? Is that you have

682
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:20,710
enumerable

683
00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:22,710
Quasi Autonomous

684
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:25,739
Subsystems that make you up that will generate

685
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:32,459
Stories impulsively, and you'll just act them out and you know that because you watch yourself over two weeks

686
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:35,220
And you think Jesus I did a lot of stupid things in the last two weeks

687
00:52:35,220 --> 00:52:40,889
And you think why it's because you're a random. You're a collection of somewhat Random quasi

688
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:43,560
Autonomous personality units and

689
00:52:44,109 --> 00:52:48,839
Lacking a leader. They're just going to fire off whenever they want you know first you're hungry

690
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:50,879
Then you're thirsty then you want to go to bed with your wife

691
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:55,470
You know then you want to sleep in and you want to tell your boss off and you want to curse at the guy that?

692
00:52:55,470 --> 00:52:58,439
Cuts you off in traffic. It's like you're kind of like a two-year-old

693
00:52:59,080 --> 00:53:01,080
You know just it's one

694
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:09,179
emotional frame after another vying for dominance there's no overarching Hierarchy, and there's no king at the top and

695
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:13,350
So you know we already talked about pyramids of competence?

696
00:53:13,350 --> 00:53:16,679
And what's supposed to be at the top is you want to bring all those things together?

697
00:53:17,290 --> 00:53:23,129
We understand this neurologically. I'll show you some of that in a little bit. We understand this neurologically how how

698
00:53:24,010 --> 00:53:30,959
this maps in some sense right on to the neural structure of your being you want to put something in control and

699
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:36,930
The thing that you should put in control is the bloody thing that pays attention and learns, right?

700
00:53:37,539 --> 00:53:44,969
Everything else in the hierarchy should be subordinate to the thing that pays attention and learns and you could think well

701
00:53:44,970 --> 00:53:51,389
That's that's the message of the idea of logos that's for sure because logos is partly attention and partly communication

702
00:53:51,390 --> 00:53:56,220
And you learn a lot by communicating with others okay? So you need to know where you are

703
00:53:57,099 --> 00:54:02,609
Just like your GPS, which is about the closest thing we have to an intelligent cybernetic system

704
00:54:02,609 --> 00:54:07,558
Those GPS is in your cars those bloody things are pretty smart because they can they know where you are

705
00:54:07,559 --> 00:54:12,899
They know where you're going and if you go off course they recalculate your route. It's like those things are damn near alive

706
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:18,480
That's so close to intelligence. It's and you can tell that because they act intelligently they solve problems

707
00:54:19,029 --> 00:54:23,099
continually so you need and this is a cybernetic model by the way and

708
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:27,059
Cybernetic models for the models on which the GPS systems were based so it's not accidental

709
00:54:27,670 --> 00:54:32,129
So you need to know where you are and you need to know where you're going and then the next thing you need to know

710
00:54:32,130 --> 00:54:34,259
Is how it is that you're going to act?

711
00:54:35,049 --> 00:54:39,599
Move your body how you're going to propel yourself through time and space to

712
00:54:40,150 --> 00:54:42,150
Transform this into that and

713
00:54:42,339 --> 00:54:48,058
So ok and then we can we can make that a little bit more complex because it's a bit too simple, so we'll do this

714
00:54:48,849 --> 00:54:51,239
So it isn't exactly that you live in one of these

715
00:54:51,339 --> 00:54:57,929
It's that you live in a nested hierarchy of these and you could think of this as your own internal Patriarchy

716
00:54:57,930 --> 00:54:59,369
That's a good way of thinking about it

717
00:54:59,369 --> 00:55:05,879
And maybe it could be a tyrant or maybe it could be something that gives you security and functional autonomy

718
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:11,279
And hopefully that's the one you go for it, but it's a battle you know because a little bit of Tyranny

719
00:55:12,519 --> 00:55:18,269
Exists in everyone and so well so at the very highest level of analysis

720
00:55:18,970 --> 00:55:20,970
That would be the overarching

721
00:55:21,009 --> 00:55:26,399
Story, maybe you think I'd like to be a good person or a successful person or famous person

722
00:55:26,549 --> 00:55:31,859
I think goods probably a bit better because you can come up with the definition of good if you want as long as it doesn't

723
00:55:31,859 --> 00:55:33,859
annoy other people too Badly

724
00:55:35,210 --> 00:55:41,769
Because they'll just get in your way, and that won't be helpful. So you have to negotiate it, but let's say you're a good person

725
00:55:42,650 --> 00:55:49,329
That's sort of the story at the top of the hierarchy and then you could decompose that into your primary roles

726
00:55:49,330 --> 00:55:53,140
Maybe you're a good parent. Maybe you're a good employer or maybe you're a good employee

727
00:55:53,870 --> 00:55:58,569
Maybe you're a good sibling. Maybe you're a good child you know those are major roles that you have in your life

728
00:55:58,570 --> 00:56:05,049
And so you'd say that what good person is is what's good about you across all those rules

729
00:56:05,050 --> 00:56:07,060
So it's a it's a it's a higher-order

730
00:56:07,670 --> 00:56:11,470
abstraction from something more concrete and then you can take the you know the

731
00:56:11,990 --> 00:56:13,940
role good parent

732
00:56:13,940 --> 00:56:15,430
And you can say well

733
00:56:15,430 --> 00:56:20,169
What is it that constitutes a good parent and you might say well a good parent this isn't exhaustive

734
00:56:20,450 --> 00:56:22,899
obviously a good parent has a good job and

735
00:56:23,450 --> 00:56:27,039
Takes care of his or her family and then you might say well

736
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:30,730
What does it mean to take care of your family and then you might say well?

737
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:33,879
You know you you can cook the odd meal not too

738
00:56:33,880 --> 00:56:39,940
Odd hopefully you can cook the odd meal and you can play with play with the baby, and then you might say well

739
00:56:39,940 --> 00:56:45,579
How do you play with a baby and then you might say well you play Peek-A-boo with the baby or you tickle the baby?

740
00:56:45,590 --> 00:56:49,150
Okay, well that's what's a cool. There's a cool shift there because this is all

741
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:54,160
Articulated and conceptual right right down to this level and then all of a sudden

742
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:56,559
It's your body because how do you play peekaboo is a baby?

743
00:56:56,660 --> 00:57:01,119
You don't like have a chat about how you play Peek-A-boo with a baby right you go like this

744
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:06,040
It's great fun. You can even do it with older people they even smile about it, right it's

745
00:57:06,890 --> 00:57:12,819
Dad's gone, and the Baby's all shocked to death about that where to go. Oh look. He's back. You know

746
00:57:12,820 --> 00:57:14,820
it's the baby is playing with the

747
00:57:14,960 --> 00:57:18,639
Reliability of the world so it's real intense game for a baby

748
00:57:19,880 --> 00:57:23,620
Like oh no, dad. God. No look. He showed up again. Oh, no

749
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:29,049
He's gone, and then bad smiling to indicate that those brief flashes into non-existence

750
00:57:29,570 --> 00:57:32,080
Aren't existentially terrifying Beyond

751
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:38,470
Capacity right and so but the point is is that if you're playing peek-A-boo with the baby? You're not thinking anymore?

752
00:57:38,470 --> 00:57:44,050
It's not in the realm of articulation or abstraction. It's actually something that you're doing with your body and so to me

753
00:57:44,050 --> 00:57:45,590
This is a nice

754
00:57:45,590 --> 00:57:51,279
multistage solution to the Mind-body problem because what happens is the highest the higher order of

755
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,919
abstraction its articulated and conceptual

756
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:55,420
but if you decompose

757
00:57:55,420 --> 00:58:01,720
It sufficiently you end up with an actual action and the action involves the movement of musculature

758
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:07,060
It's not something conceptual and one of the things that's really cool about this hierarchy

759
00:58:07,670 --> 00:58:08,990
Is that it has?

760
00:58:08,990 --> 00:58:15,219
Educational lessons so one of the things you want to do if you're trying to teach someone something even yourself is you want to?

761
00:58:15,410 --> 00:58:20,560
You want to specify the thing that needs to be doing at the highest resolution possible?

762
00:58:21,230 --> 00:58:24,699
Level so I'll give you just a brief example, so let's say

763
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:29,320
I may have we may be repeating this but it doesn't matter say you've got a three-Year-old kid

764
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:31,320
And they're in their room is Chaos

765
00:58:31,480 --> 00:58:35,169
Right this monsters are going to be coming out under the bed in no time flat unless that thing

766
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:39,699
Room gets some order in it and so you you tell the kids clean up the room?

767
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:43,689
You know it's a mess and you leave and you come back and the kids like throwing legos everywhere

768
00:58:43,690 --> 00:58:47,560
It's they're not cleaning up, and then you think that's a bad kid

769
00:58:47,810 --> 00:58:48,670
That's a bad

770
00:58:48,670 --> 00:58:52,450
Theory a because you're going right from here to here

771
00:58:52,670 --> 00:58:56,440
If you want to have a good fight with someone and destroy them then that's what you do

772
00:58:56,440 --> 00:59:00,970
You don't bother with the subtleties down here. You just go right from the great for the jugular

773
00:59:01,040 --> 00:59:05,229
It's like you're a bad stupid kid you've always been that way you're hopeless

774
00:59:05,270 --> 00:59:07,689
There's not a chance of teaching you anything, right?

775
00:59:07,820 --> 00:59:13,840
and we can that way you can nail the past the present and the future all of the same in so you've always been a

776
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:15,230
Terrible person

777
00:59:15,230 --> 00:59:18,459
There's no teaching you and your future is going to be exactly the same way

778
00:59:18,590 --> 00:59:24,309
Then the only thing the person can do if you do that to them is hit you because that's that's it. There's no

779
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:29,439
There's no coming back from that you've boxed them completely in so if you want to have a really unproductive

780
00:59:29,540 --> 00:59:31,540
Argument you go right for this

781
00:59:32,049 --> 00:59:37,169
past present and future you're not a good person Demolish their entire conceptual structure and

782
00:59:37,479 --> 00:59:44,218
Expose them completely naked to Chaos. It's like great you won the argument. It's not a good thing to do to your

783
00:59:44,739 --> 00:59:49,529
long-term partner let's say unless you want them terrified out of this skull and

784
00:59:51,369 --> 00:59:56,488
Characterised and their attitude towards you characterized by non-stop extreme resentment

785
00:59:56,559 --> 01:00:02,189
It's probably not going to do your love life a hell of a lot of good for example, so with the three year old

786
01:00:02,190 --> 01:00:06,299
Maybe what you do is you say you pick the level of analysis at which

787
01:00:06,299 --> 01:00:07,650
They're actually functioning

788
01:00:07,650 --> 01:00:12,599
And you say and this is something you can do if you pay attention to a kid and lots of people won't pay attention to

789
01:00:12,599 --> 01:00:14,170
Children because they're terrified of them

790
01:00:14,170 --> 01:00:19,769
They're terrified that they'll do something wrong with them and or that the kid won't like them or some damn thing

791
01:00:19,809 --> 01:00:20,829
it's like

792
01:00:20,829 --> 01:00:24,718
All you have to do to get a kid to like you is pay attention to the kid for like two

793
01:00:24,789 --> 01:00:28,799
seconds and the kid will instantly like you because attention is so

794
01:00:29,589 --> 01:00:31,589
It's such a it's it's the ultimate

795
01:00:32,829 --> 01:00:38,699
Currency for children right they need adult attention because adults know way more than kids and so they love attention

796
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:42,569
All you have to do is pay attention to them. They will like you instantly, so

797
01:00:43,180 --> 01:00:45,809
They tell the kid you see that teddy bear

798
01:00:46,390 --> 01:00:47,650
Kid goes yes

799
01:00:47,650 --> 01:00:54,690
Then you've established that the child has mastered the art of perceiving a teddy bear because they can say yes

800
01:00:54,690 --> 01:00:56,700
It's this complicated thing man. It's like

801
01:00:56,700 --> 01:01:00,809
I aged six months old isn't going to do that three months old has got the whole teddy bear

802
01:01:01,569 --> 01:01:07,288
Identification subroutine and traumatized so teddy bear yes, can you pick it up? Yes?

803
01:01:08,769 --> 01:01:15,689
Pat pat pat good work. Do you see the hole on that show yes. Can you put the teddy bear in that hole?

804
01:01:16,119 --> 01:01:18,929
Yes, go over do that pat Pat pat?

805
01:01:19,630 --> 01:01:23,789
Great ok now. We'll do thing number two thing number three

806
01:01:23,789 --> 01:01:28,498
So you're building up the micro routines of cleaning up the room from the bottom up, right you?

807
01:01:28,599 --> 01:01:33,209
you're building it into their body because you're starting with the things they've already automatized and

808
01:01:33,549 --> 01:01:39,599
Building upWards towards abstraction and so once the kid has all the micro Routines down and maybe there's I don't know how many

809
01:01:39,789 --> 01:01:41,789
Micro Routines are there to clean up your room?

810
01:01:42,279 --> 01:01:43,990
200 like A

811
01:01:43,990 --> 01:01:45,730
Lot but not an infinite number

812
01:01:45,730 --> 01:01:49,260
So you teach them all the micro Routines and then you can say run?

813
01:01:49,720 --> 01:01:54,270
Set of micro Routines which means clean up room, and then they can do it

814
01:01:54,270 --> 01:01:58,979
they know what it means so but you do the building from the bottom up and lots of times when you're

815
01:01:59,530 --> 01:02:06,090
Arguing with someone that you live with and hypothetically loved although those two things are hard to get together in the same relationship

816
01:02:07,510 --> 01:02:14,580
What you want to do is assume is assume stupidity before you assume total in total malevolence

817
01:02:14,580 --> 01:02:17,669
That's that's that's a good rule of thumb for establishing peace

818
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:23,220
So maybe if your partner won't do something well, maybe it's there's something going on up here

819
01:02:23,220 --> 01:02:29,010
But you might want to assume to begin with they actually just don't know how to do it and you need to decompose it

820
01:02:29,010 --> 01:02:31,560
So maybe there's a way you want to be greeted when you come home

821
01:02:31,750 --> 01:02:37,229
Because you're going to come home every day probably and maybe that's a five minute interaction or a 10 minute interaction

822
01:02:37,230 --> 01:02:43,949
So that's an hour a week, or four hours a month or 50 hours a year or one solid work week of coming home

823
01:02:44,530 --> 01:02:51,479
Interactions right all you have to do is get 50 interactions like that right and you've got your relationships sorted out

824
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:58,410
That's something that's really worth thinking about so that's it. There's you just don't have that much time right get the meals sorted out

825
01:02:58,410 --> 01:03:01,259
That's about five hours a day get your sleeping time

826
01:03:02,020 --> 01:03:06,540
Arrangements Sorted out get the fundamental interactions that you repeat with your partner

827
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:12,179
Worked out voluntarily and negotiated you're going to cover 80% of your life that way

828
01:03:12,180 --> 01:03:16,169
And then it can just run as a routine and that's really helpful, and if you don't do that

829
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:18,840
consciously especially because our roles have

830
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:24,689
fragmented and most of the traditional rules have disappeared and so nobody knows who the hell is supposed to do what in the kitchen for

831
01:03:24,690 --> 01:03:30,240
example
So nobody does anything except bitch and fight make wretched meals or or buy

832
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:35,879
Or buy fast food or some something like that, so you know the alternative to that

833
01:03:36,580 --> 01:03:37,750
catastrophic

834
01:03:37,750 --> 01:03:43,080
Failure or continual resentment and fighting is to rebuild the structures from the bottom up using

835
01:03:43,690 --> 01:03:49,770
Consensus and negotiation and you can do that so that you can think of that as the patriarchal structure

836
01:03:49,870 --> 01:03:56,640
That's a good one, and I mean it's partly psychological because these are things you do as a person, but it's also partly political

837
01:03:57,230 --> 01:04:02,840
Economic and sociological because while you're doing each of these things you're also doing them in a way

838
01:04:02,840 --> 01:04:08,179
that's socially hopefully not just socially acceptable, but actually socially desirable and

839
01:04:08,790 --> 01:04:12,739
So that's that's the decomposition and the reason that this

840
01:04:13,050 --> 01:04:18,080
Keeps Chaos at Bay is because it isn't because your belief systems keep Chaos at Bay

841
01:04:18,630 --> 01:04:20,060
It's not that abstract

842
01:04:20,060 --> 01:04:25,100
It's that if you do things right do these things right then terrible things happen to you with less frequency

843
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:30,889
And that's not the psyche like it's partly psychological because maybe you don't fight as much. Maybe not anxious as much

844
01:04:30,890 --> 01:04:32,000
Maybe you're not as depressed

845
01:04:32,000 --> 01:04:38,209
but a lot of it's just practical if you just if you you know if your kid doesn't leave his skateboard on the

846
01:04:38,700 --> 01:04:39,200
stairs

847
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:42,649
Then you don't break your neck as often and that's not just psychological

848
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:50,540
That's actually a good thing not to break your neck so often and so this structure isn't merely something that keeps things at Bay

849
01:04:51,150 --> 01:04:52,170
psychologically

850
01:04:52,170 --> 01:04:56,240
okay, so here's a here's another look at A

851
01:04:59,220 --> 01:05:00,780
Hierarchy of A

852
01:05:00,780 --> 01:05:02,040
narrative

853
01:05:02,040 --> 01:05:05,060
the structure that keeps Chaos at Bay, and this is maybe

854
01:05:05,790 --> 01:05:11,479
The Hierarchy that I engage in when I'm writing and I'm doing all these things at the same time. That's that's what's cool

855
01:05:11,480 --> 01:05:14,869
You know like that when I ask student. What are you doing when you write an essay?

856
01:05:15,930 --> 01:05:18,230
It's like well that's hard question right? It's like

857
01:05:19,440 --> 01:05:20,790
well, you're

858
01:05:20,790 --> 01:05:24,679
Fast and important question, that's the first thing you should do if you're writing an essay

859
01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:29,389
Then you're paying attention to the words and the phrases in the sentences and the sentence

860
01:05:30,119 --> 01:05:32,869
relationship between the sentences within the paragraphs and the paragraph

861
01:05:33,240 --> 01:05:35,090
relationships to one another within the essay

862
01:05:35,090 --> 01:05:42,709
And then they ask these relevance to the class and the class is relevance to your life and what the essay bleeds out

863
01:05:42,990 --> 01:05:50,090
Across your entire life and so if I'm writing something well obviously at the most

864
01:05:50,609 --> 01:05:57,199
Highest resolution level of analysis, I'm actually moving my fingers on the keyboard and moving my eyes back and forth on the screen

865
01:05:57,330 --> 01:05:59,419
That's where the mind meets the body

866
01:05:59,730 --> 01:06:04,250
But then I'm trying to formulate a sentence and so I try to think up a good sentence

867
01:06:04,250 --> 01:06:08,629
That's that's nailing what I am trying to formulate and then I try to pick it apart

868
01:06:08,970 --> 01:06:12,810
And I do that a bunch of ways take the sentence and I put it on another page

869
01:06:12,810 --> 01:06:17,880
and then a rate like 10 different variants of the sentence and see if I can get a better Variant and then I try to

870
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:23,009
think of ways that it's a stupid sentence to see if I can you know put a pry bar underneath it and

871
01:06:23,290 --> 01:06:23,970
Loosen it up

872
01:06:23,970 --> 01:06:29,550
and if I can't do anything if I can't manage that then I keep the sentence that I've got and then I do that with

873
01:06:29,650 --> 01:06:31,150
ten sentences in a paragraph

874
01:06:31,150 --> 01:06:37,439
And I make sure the sentences are all arranged properly in the paragraph the same way by rewriting a bunch of different variants of it

875
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:43,170
And trying to get the word right in a phrase right and the sentence right and the sentence order right and the paragraph order?

876
01:06:43,170 --> 01:06:49,889
Right and I can tell what it's right enough because I can't make it any better. It doesn't mean it's right it

877
01:06:49,890 --> 01:06:53,759
Just means I can't improve it and so I get to the point where if I'm writing a paragraph

878
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:59,219
And I write a variant, and I can't tell if the variance is any better, and it might be worse than I'm done

879
01:06:59,220 --> 01:07:06,150
I'd hit the limit of my intellectual capacity and it's time to move on but then but you know that it isn't like the

880
01:07:06,340 --> 01:07:09,239
Essay that I'm writing. Let's say has a boundary

881
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:14,489
It's tightly drawn around the essay because there's a reason I'm writing the damn essay, and that would be well

882
01:07:14,490 --> 01:07:17,130
I'm trying to I'm turned write a whole manuscript

883
01:07:17,380 --> 01:07:21,119
Hopefully, I'm trying to address an important problem because why would I be doing it otherwise?

884
01:07:21,120 --> 01:07:26,189
I mean, that'd be kind of pointless, and maybe that's part of my role as a scientist

885
01:07:26,190 --> 01:07:28,770
And that's a subset of my role as a professor

886
01:07:28,770 --> 01:07:35,219
and then that's a subset of my role as a productive citizen and then that's a subset of my role of

887
01:07:35,590 --> 01:07:40,799
Someone who confronts the unknown see and that's why the logos is

888
01:07:41,410 --> 01:07:43,410
The thing that's at the top of the Hierarchy

889
01:07:43,750 --> 01:07:50,280
That's how the hierarchy should be structured is that everything else should be see because you have a structure. Do you think well?

890
01:07:50,280 --> 01:07:54,090
What should the structure be subordinate to and then the answer should be something like?

891
01:07:54,310 --> 01:07:58,620
the structure should be subordinate to the process that generates the structure or the

892
01:07:59,230 --> 01:08:03,930
Structure should be subordinate to the process that generates and maintains the structure well

893
01:08:04,210 --> 01:08:04,720
obviously

894
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:07,949
How could it be any other way unless the structure is perfect?

895
01:08:08,260 --> 01:08:13,680
With the in which case you dispensed with the thing that generates it and improves it, but then you're a totalitarian

896
01:08:13,680 --> 01:08:19,349
It's like hey, we got the answer. It's like no, you don't people are still suffering and they're still dying

897
01:08:19,480 --> 01:08:21,480
You don't have the damn answer

898
01:08:21,800 --> 01:08:26,779
And so maybe you have an answer that means that there isn't quite as much suffering and dying as there could be

899
01:08:27,150 --> 01:08:31,219
But there's plenty of road to be traveled yet, and so

900
01:08:31,740 --> 01:08:35,840
It all makes perfect sense that all of this should be should be

901
01:08:36,840 --> 01:08:41,119
nested within this highest sigh think of it, sort of as the highest order of

902
01:08:41,340 --> 01:08:47,029
Moral striving and then that also gives you Moral Hierarchy, that's the most important thing

903
01:08:47,220 --> 01:08:52,309
We do that with honor speech you do that with the tension and honest speech. That's how you do that, and

904
01:08:53,220 --> 01:08:57,949
you don't sacrifice that to any of this because if you do then

905
01:08:58,800 --> 01:09:00,210
Then you're hurting your soul

906
01:09:00,210 --> 01:09:02,130
It's there's this idea in the new

907
01:09:02,130 --> 01:09:08,089
Testament that the sin against the holy ghost is the one sin that can't be forgiven no one knows what the hell that means maybe

908
01:09:08,090 --> 01:09:12,019
it doesn't mean anything, but I think this is what it means is that because

909
01:09:12,690 --> 01:09:14,430
this process

910
01:09:14,430 --> 01:09:16,430
generates all this if you

911
01:09:17,790 --> 01:09:19,080
violate that

912
01:09:19,080 --> 01:09:21,350
process then there's no hope for you because

913
01:09:21,720 --> 01:09:26,659
That's the process by which you improve yourself and everyone else to everything else

914
01:09:26,730 --> 01:09:29,569
So if you decide you're not going to engage in that it's like well

915
01:09:29,760 --> 01:09:36,920
There's no fixing that because you've blown apart your relationship with the thing that does the fixing and so

916
01:09:39,090 --> 01:09:42,499
Ok and so that's how you keep Chaos at Bay and so part of that is

917
01:09:42,660 --> 01:09:44,809
Structural right because you know how to do these things

918
01:09:45,660 --> 01:09:46,430
More or less

919
01:09:46,430 --> 01:09:50,690
It's part of your skill set if you happen to be a writer you could build one of these for a plumber

920
01:09:50,690 --> 01:09:57,319
it doesn't doesn't make any difference really although the outside things should be the same which is I think partly why in

921
01:09:57,810 --> 01:09:59,810
in the Judeo-Christian tradition

922
01:09:59,940 --> 01:10:01,500
there's the

923
01:10:01,500 --> 01:10:08,240
Assumption that people are fundamentally equal before God and what that means is that well they should be

924
01:10:09,660 --> 01:10:12,619
nested everyone regardless of their particularly

925
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:21,200
Particularities as individuals their highest order function is that they do it in whatever Manner they can manage and that's an extraordinarily

926
01:10:21,570 --> 01:10:24,380
valuable or maybe the most extraordinarily valuable

927
01:10:25,470 --> 01:10:33,170
Sociological political and economic function and so that's why people are valuable, it's like we have this faculty to continually generate

928
01:10:33,720 --> 01:10:35,720
improvements to the structure that

929
01:10:36,440 --> 01:10:38,440
We jointly inhabit

930
01:10:38,630 --> 01:10:44,949
Great that gives us. It's so cool. Because that gives us a fundamental unity we've got the highest order of

931
01:10:46,130 --> 01:10:53,650
Analysis with with the room for as much diversity as you can possibly manage right because it actually turns out that the more

932
01:10:53,900 --> 01:10:58,599
The sub structures differ the better because then you know you can be doing something different than me

933
01:10:58,599 --> 01:11:02,949
That would be good because if we were doing the same thing then it's just duplication of labor if we could

934
01:11:03,170 --> 01:11:08,409
agree on the higher order principle and then specialize that the lower order levels, it's like that's

935
01:11:08,690 --> 01:11:13,329
you get to have your cake and eat it too, and that doesn't happen very often so

936
01:11:15,469 --> 01:11:20,529
So and so then another rule of thumb is if you're trying to solve a problem solve it at this level

937
01:11:21,380 --> 01:11:26,559
Highest resolution level possible before you dare move up dare move up the hierarchy

938
01:11:26,959 --> 01:11:34,839
Because the as you move up the abstraction Hierarchy the probability that you'll make a catastrophic error while attempting to fix the problem

939
01:11:35,239 --> 01:11:37,099
radically increases because

940
01:11:37,099 --> 01:11:40,299
Abstraction is very very powerful and so you want to be very careful

941
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:40,690
I mean

942
01:11:40,690 --> 01:11:47,739
we saw that when you know when the you know when the mortgage market crashed the reason it crashed was because of strange use of

943
01:11:48,019 --> 01:11:53,259
Derivatives and derivatives are like higher order abstractions in the financial world and derivatives give you

944
01:11:53,900 --> 01:11:55,610
Tremendous Financial

945
01:11:55,610 --> 01:12:03,009
Leverage and power with huge risk and so the upside is massive absolutely massive because you can multiply your earnings

946
01:12:03,019 --> 01:12:06,759
But the downside is complete Bloody catastrophe and so

947
01:12:07,309 --> 01:12:11,799
Part of what I would say an intelligent conservative. Ethos is is

948
01:12:12,769 --> 01:12:18,669
Solve the problem at the highest level of resolution the highest level most local level of resolution

949
01:12:18,670 --> 01:12:22,449
It's safer, and it's more likely to actually produce a solution

950
01:12:23,809 --> 01:12:25,809
ok now, so

951
01:12:26,599 --> 01:12:28,510
Now you're in your plan now

952
01:12:28,510 --> 01:12:32,619
We're simplified again just to one little map right, but all those other things are nested in there

953
01:12:32,619 --> 01:12:35,529
And so what happens to you as you stroll?

954
01:12:36,079 --> 01:12:41,829
Merrily on your way through life. Well, what happens is that as you're moving from point a to point b you?

955
01:12:42,409 --> 01:12:44,059
encounter things and

956
01:12:44,059 --> 01:12:46,179
People think that what they encounter are

957
01:12:46,790 --> 01:12:52,399
But that's not the case first of all most of the things that you encounter many of the things are actually other people

958
01:12:52,400 --> 01:12:55,280
And they're not objects. They're too damn complex and even

959
01:12:56,220 --> 01:13:03,109
Apart from the social world the things that you encounter aren't objects they seem to be something more like tools or obstacles

960
01:13:03,110 --> 01:13:06,830
And I don't mean that we see objects and turn them into tools or obstacles

961
01:13:06,830 --> 01:13:11,629
I mean that we see tools and obstacles because what happens is that when you array yourself

962
01:13:12,750 --> 01:13:14,610
Towards a goal

963
01:13:14,610 --> 01:13:19,190
Then the world transforms itself into things that get in the way of that goal and things that

964
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:24,230
Three things things are get in the way of the goal things those are things you don't like things that

965
01:13:24,660 --> 01:13:29,749
facilitate your movement towards the goal those are things that you like and the irrelevant things and

966
01:13:29,970 --> 01:13:37,099
Mostly you want irrelevant things because there's just too damn many things so the category of irrelevant is one you really like so

967
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:40,850
most the thing most of everything is irrelevant if you have a good plan a

968
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:46,460
few things are good because they move you forward and some other things are not so good you want to go around the not so

969
01:13:46,460 --> 01:13:50,629
Good things if you can manage them unless you like to run head forth into like Brick Walls

970
01:13:50,630 --> 01:13:54,920
Which is not particularly so learning experience, but I would repeat it too many times

971
01:13:55,440 --> 01:13:59,210
you want you want the world to array itself as a set of

972
01:14:00,000 --> 01:14:05,660
We could say tools now what happens is that you have this perceptual system. That's mediated by dopamine

973
01:14:05,660 --> 01:14:08,329
it's the same system that cocaine activates or

974
01:14:08,940 --> 01:14:13,910
methamphetamine or the drugs that people really like to take and it's the dopaminergic system that

975
01:14:14,220 --> 01:14:19,669
Responds with positive emotion to indications that you've encountered something that will facilitate your movement towards a goal

976
01:14:19,710 --> 01:14:27,020
And that's really important to know because people tend to think that they're happy because they achieve goals, and that's not true

977
01:14:27,540 --> 01:14:30,680
What's true it because as soon as you achieve a goal, then you have a problem

978
01:14:30,680 --> 01:14:36,499
Which is what's the next goal, and that's actually a big problem. You encounter that as soon as you graduate from university for example

979
01:14:36,500 --> 01:14:38,500
It's right. I made this joke before

980
01:14:38,970 --> 01:14:42,589
The graduation day here's like King of the University Hierarchy

981
01:14:43,140 --> 01:14:49,399
Undergraduate Hierarchy day after you're unemployed potential Starbucks employee right so it's like

982
01:14:49,770 --> 01:14:51,770
so obviously the

983
01:14:52,980 --> 01:14:55,580
Accomplishment per se as a source of reward is is

984
01:14:56,250 --> 01:15:03,080
Problematic because when you accomplish you run the frame to its and then you have the problem of needing a new frame

985
01:15:03,179 --> 01:15:09,679
So that's a problem, but if what you're encountering instead are things that will move you along your way. It's like. Hey

986
01:15:09,679 --> 01:15:14,929
That's great, and that's where you get your positive motivation, and so that's really thinking that's so much

987
01:15:14,929 --> 01:15:15,719
We're thinking about

988
01:15:15,719 --> 01:15:20,479
You can think about that for a year and that wouldn't even be enough to think about it because here's what it means it

989
01:15:20,610 --> 01:15:24,170
Means in some sense that the buddhists are right with their claim about Maya

990
01:15:24,810 --> 01:15:30,199
Mnya which means that people live in an illusion and what they mean by that is well you have goal

991
01:15:30,630 --> 01:15:37,940
Whatever your goal is and that goal gives relevance to the world and you could change the relevance of the world in a snap

992
01:15:38,219 --> 01:15:40,219
Just by changing your goal

993
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:42,590
You can do that, and so then you think well

994
01:15:42,590 --> 01:15:48,049
it's sort of an illusion because you can just change it now you don't want to push that line of argumentation too far because

995
01:15:48,989 --> 01:15:55,099
Even if the specific point can be changed the fact that you're in one of these frames

996
01:15:55,500 --> 01:15:59,660
Cannot be changed and so you have to be in a frame although you get to pick the frame

997
01:15:59,660 --> 01:16:04,579
So there's still an absolute there, which is that you have to be in the frame and that is not a trivial absolute

998
01:16:04,580 --> 01:16:06,649
It's a very it's a very major absolute

999
01:16:06,660 --> 01:16:12,469
So then you think okay all of your positive emotion is going to be experienced in relationship to the goal

1000
01:16:13,140 --> 01:16:18,529
Well, then we think well, you could use some positive emotion. It's a good thing positive emotion

1001
01:16:19,620 --> 01:16:25,699
Inhibits anxiety and disappointment and frustration and pain it does all that

1002
01:16:26,550 --> 01:16:31,699
Technically it does that that's why a football player with a broken thumb who wants to score a touchdown can go out there

1003
01:16:31,920 --> 01:16:36,649
You know play the football game even though. It's a kind of an arbitrary goal, right?

1004
01:16:36,650 --> 01:16:38,650
It's like really you're going to go out there and like

1005
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:45,500
Risk your hand to fire a pigskin through some some polls. It's like

1006
01:16:46,199 --> 01:16:52,639
Well, you could say the same sort of cynical thing about most of the things that people do but you can't say the silikal thing

1007
01:16:52,640 --> 01:16:55,009
about the fact that they have to do things, so

1008
01:16:55,260 --> 01:16:59,510
You have a you have a point you have your aim you have your ambition?

1009
01:16:59,510 --> 01:17:05,929
And then that's what turns the world into a potentially positive place and here's the kicker. This is so cool

1010
01:17:06,690 --> 01:17:09,560
The higher they aim the more the positive emotion

1011
01:17:10,530 --> 01:17:17,699
So that's that you think well. Why should I bother you? Why should I bother doing something lofty and difficult it's like

1012
01:17:18,520 --> 01:17:20,520
Because it's worth it

1013
01:17:21,580 --> 01:17:22,870
That's why?

1014
01:17:22,870 --> 01:17:28,499
Because the alternative is stupid suffering because really really because what happens is

1015
01:17:28,810 --> 01:17:33,120
Like you don't need a framework in order to suffer

1016
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:36,510
You can just lay there day after day

1017
01:17:37,330 --> 01:17:41,519
And suffer right that's the easy that's the default condition

1018
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:44,340
If you don't have a lofty ambition

1019
01:17:44,530 --> 01:17:49,920
Then you suffer miserably and the reason for that is life is really complex short

1020
01:17:50,320 --> 01:17:56,520
Finite full of suffering and beyond you and so you can just lay there and think about that, and it's horrible

1021
01:17:56,520 --> 01:18:02,370
And so that's not helpful. It's just not useful and so you know people often say life is meaningless

1022
01:18:02,370 --> 01:18:03,060
It's like no

1023
01:18:03,060 --> 01:18:03,790
it's not

1024
01:18:03,790 --> 01:18:08,819
That's wrong because it was meaningless that would be easy you could just sit there and do nothing and it would matter right

1025
01:18:08,820 --> 01:18:10,820
it'd be like you were look like you're like a

1026
01:18:11,110 --> 01:18:13,560
Lobotomized sheep. It's just irrelevant

1027
01:18:13,870 --> 01:18:20,339
But that isn't what happens when people say that life has no meaning that isn't what they mean what they mean is

1028
01:18:20,340 --> 01:18:26,940
I'm suffering stupidly and intensely, and I don't know what to do about it. Well the suffering is meaningful

1029
01:18:27,130 --> 01:18:30,449
It's just not the kind of meaning you want so how do you get out of that?

1030
01:18:31,210 --> 01:18:32,710
you adopt

1031
01:18:32,710 --> 01:18:34,660
you

1032
01:18:34,660 --> 01:18:42,059
You note the baseline of suffering which is very very very very high and then you say to yourself, okay?

1033
01:18:42,060 --> 01:18:44,100
I need to do something that justifies that and

1034
01:18:44,770 --> 01:18:50,160
That's not so easy because it's the baseline for suffering is high if you're going to make something of yourself

1035
01:18:50,530 --> 01:18:52,980
Let's say so that it's worthwhile to

1036
01:18:53,530 --> 01:18:57,660
exist in the world then you have to do is you have to aim at something that's

1037
01:18:58,060 --> 01:19:01,919
So well structured that you can say yeah

1038
01:19:02,620 --> 01:19:05,489
earthquakes cancer death of my family

1039
01:19:06,010 --> 01:19:10,290
dissolution of my goals ultimate futility of life and the heat death of the universe

1040
01:19:10,840 --> 01:19:13,590
Hey, it doesn't matter it's worth it

1041
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:16,800
Alright

1042
01:19:17,350 --> 01:19:20,160
So now here's an here's

1043
01:19:21,400 --> 01:19:23,400
another complicating factor

1044
01:19:23,500 --> 01:19:29,910
So I said well, there's three things that you can run into when you're going about your your goal

1045
01:19:31,510 --> 01:19:33,690
And I would say if you're going to farm a goal

1046
01:19:33,700 --> 01:19:40,320
It's going to form a plan look about three to five years out in the future because Beyond that you get something called

1047
01:19:42,880 --> 01:19:47,369
Combinatorial explosion and it means that there's so many variables you just can't predict

1048
01:19:47,370 --> 01:19:50,849
So there's not that much point looking out 20 years because like what the hell

1049
01:19:50,850 --> 01:19:55,650
You know what's going to happen in 20 years nothing three years. Maybe you've got

1050
01:19:55,960 --> 01:20:00,450
Maybe you can chart a course to three years five years something like that, so that's not a bad

1051
01:20:01,240 --> 01:20:05,490
segment of time to to consider and then consider

1052
01:20:06,220 --> 01:20:09,869
What your life would have to be like in order for it to be worthwhile for you?

1053
01:20:10,090 --> 01:20:14,009
Knowing also what you're going to be like if it isn't worthwhile for you

1054
01:20:14,010 --> 01:20:17,670
And what you're going to be like if it isn't worthwhile for you is Caine

1055
01:20:19,270 --> 01:20:20,370
That's what you're like

1056
01:20:20,370 --> 01:20:22,829
Because that's what that Story's about because Abel's the guy who?

1057
01:20:23,170 --> 01:20:27,599
Has a goal and is making the proper sacrifices and cain is the person for whom

1058
01:20:28,180 --> 01:20:33,209
By his own fault at least in part things aren't working out for and so the default

1059
01:20:33,790 --> 01:20:39,120
For not doing this is something like building resentment bitterness with an underlying

1060
01:20:39,640 --> 01:20:41,290
What would you call it?

1061
01:20:41,290 --> 01:20:43,470
Flavor Enhancer of Murderous

1062
01:20:43,750 --> 01:20:49,650
Resentment something like that which you will act out in the world which people act out in the world all the time and it's no

1063
01:20:49,650 --> 01:20:51,310
Wonder because without

1064
01:20:51,310 --> 01:20:53,640
this without something lofty

1065
01:20:54,820 --> 01:20:56,080
pulling you along

1066
01:20:56,080 --> 01:21:01,320
then the baseline is stupid suffering and you know if you take an analog and you just chained in the

1067
01:21:01,420 --> 01:21:03,300
Backyard you know you put a collar on it

1068
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:08,909
That's too tight, so it chafes all the time, and it can't even bark and you know there's just dirt around it

1069
01:21:08,910 --> 01:21:14,430
It's too goddamn hot out in the sun, and maybe don't give it enough water. You know it's not going to be very happy dog

1070
01:21:15,130 --> 01:21:20,849
it's basic conditions misery well the same applies to people, so

1071
01:21:22,090 --> 01:21:24,090
all right, so you're on your way to

1072
01:21:24,190 --> 01:21:30,809
See you remember the you've all probably watched pinocchio or know about it one of the things that happens

1073
01:21:30,810 --> 01:21:37,440
It's really cool in pinocchio. Is that when geppetto decides that he wants his puppet to be a genuine?

1074
01:21:38,620 --> 01:21:40,540
Autonomous being

1075
01:21:40,540 --> 01:21:42,100
He wishes upon a star

1076
01:21:42,100 --> 01:21:43,290
It's a very strange thing

1077
01:21:43,290 --> 01:21:50,370
But everybody just swallows it because we don't notice when we're swallowing things that are that are completely preposterous. You know it's this

1078
01:21:51,670 --> 01:21:52,720
animated

1079
01:21:52,720 --> 01:21:57,929
Puppeteer, which is not a star that is puppet is going to become real and everybody know it's their head and goes

1080
01:21:57,930 --> 01:22:02,849
Oh you have that big sense. It's like no, it doesn't it doesn't make any sense at all, but it doesn't matter

1081
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:06,120
It doesn't make this sort of sense that we normally associate with sense

1082
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:12,450
It makes a kind of meta sense and everybody understands it so this is what Geppetto is doing is he's elevating his eyes

1083
01:22:12,790 --> 01:22:17,760
above the Horizon so out of the realm of the worldly let's say to the

1084
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:24,510
Transcendent and the transcendent will say for all intents and purposes you can see the transcendent spread above you in

1085
01:22:25,330 --> 01:22:27,419
the heaven that arches over us

1086
01:22:27,420 --> 01:22:30,270
It gets close enough for our purposes

1087
01:22:30,270 --> 01:22:36,959
and there's a star there and a star of something that's eternal that shines in the darkness and so geppetto makes an agreement with the

1088
01:22:37,270 --> 01:22:41,790
Transcendent he says look I'm willing to do whatever it takes that my creation becomes autonomous

1089
01:22:42,790 --> 01:22:47,249
Well that's exactly this situation that you want to set up for yourself is like okay. You've got to figure out

1090
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:54,390
What star you're going to orient yourself by and you have to ask yourself like no one's ever asked you okay?

1091
01:22:54,820 --> 01:22:58,679
if you have the choice to make your life worth living

1092
01:22:59,500 --> 01:23:01,330
What's your price?

1093
01:23:01,330 --> 01:23:03,010
What do you need?

1094
01:23:03,010 --> 01:23:09,780
Just find out first of all you just ask you'll tell yourself like you'll be afraid because if I'll never get that it's like don't

1095
01:23:09,780 --> 01:23:12,629
lower your sights a little bit then you know don't ask for a

1096
01:23:12,910 --> 01:23:18,660
80-foot Super yacht in like six months that just means you're stupid you know as it doesn't mean you're not

1097
01:23:18,790 --> 01:23:21,660
You know first of all it's not going to make you happy anyways, you know

1098
01:23:21,660 --> 01:23:28,889
It's just not it's not it's not wise you're asking you supposed to be asking yourself this question like you're someone you care about

1099
01:23:29,350 --> 01:23:32,939
So you imagine you're talking to some 12 year old kid that you kind of like?

1100
01:23:33,160 --> 01:23:36,629
Thank God it wouldn't be so bad if this twelve-Year-old kid at a decent life

1101
01:23:37,090 --> 01:23:37,900
so

1102
01:23:37,900 --> 01:23:43,200
You - it's like it wouldn't be so bad the universe wouldn't mind if you had a decent life if there is little less suffering

1103
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:45,720
On your part especially if you didn't you know?

1104
01:23:45,910 --> 01:23:47,410
Foist it off on other people

1105
01:23:47,410 --> 01:23:49,769
If there's a little less suffering on your part

1106
01:23:49,770 --> 01:23:53,520
And you made things a little better everywhere you went it's like the universe would probably

1107
01:23:53,610 --> 01:23:58,889
Okay with that. So you could I think you could get away with it if you're sort of quiet about it and so

1108
01:23:59,740 --> 01:24:06,030
Ask yourself okay, so then once you've established your your target. You know where you are then you know

1109
01:24:06,030 --> 01:24:12,330
what's good for you because that moves you along and that happens at a perceptual level you don't have to think about it anymore and

1110
01:24:12,490 --> 01:24:20,340
the experimental literature, and that's already quite clear, so for example if I specify that podium as the target for my

1111
01:24:20,950 --> 01:24:27,750
action you know then I'm happy when I'm walking towards it because there it is and everything cooperating really nicely, but if I specify

1112
01:24:28,510 --> 01:24:31,949
going to the exit sign that you guys can't see that's the

1113
01:24:32,200 --> 01:24:38,790
That that this is an obstacle in the front of then as soon as I specify that then that's an annoying obstacle

1114
01:24:38,790 --> 01:24:43,379
And that's precognitive it just happens immediately it happens instantaneously

1115
01:24:43,480 --> 01:24:48,239
And so it really is the case that you you you're you're being

1116
01:24:48,760 --> 01:24:54,030
Manifests itself inside these frames and so what's so cool about that is you can change the frame

1117
01:24:54,030 --> 01:25:00,239
it doesn't mean you can like juggle planets or anything like that, but it does give you quite a scope of

1118
01:25:01,960 --> 01:25:03,100
what I'm

1119
01:25:03,100 --> 01:25:08,339
Trammeled action within the world and if the frame isn't working out then you can tweak it or sometimes you have to make a major

1120
01:25:08,340 --> 01:25:09,490
adjustment in it whatever

1121
01:25:09,490 --> 01:25:13,740
You don't have to stick to the damn thing like it's the ideology that you're going to die for

1122
01:25:14,160 --> 01:25:16,260
It's a tentative plan it's a work in progress

1123
01:25:16,420 --> 01:25:22,290
And it's nuts with the future authoring program one of the things I recommend for people is that they should do it badly

1124
01:25:22,870 --> 01:25:27,510
Because you're not going to get it right anyways, but a reasonable plan is

1125
01:25:28,120 --> 01:25:33,000
way better than no plan plus a reasonable plan is a plan that has built into it the

1126
01:25:34,540 --> 01:25:37,649
Processes that will enable the plan to get better as you implement it

1127
01:25:37,650 --> 01:25:43,409
So you just start with ab reasonable plan so you don't have to worry about whether it's correct it's not correct

1128
01:25:44,080 --> 01:25:49,139
Doesn't matter it's better than nothing. That's the issue so okay, so you've got the world parsed up into

1129
01:25:50,080 --> 01:25:53,189
Things that make making you happy when you look at them

1130
01:25:54,130 --> 01:25:57,029
Things that get in the way that produce negative emotion

1131
01:25:57,060 --> 01:26:01,169
And then a whole host of irrelevant things because almost everything is irrelevant

1132
01:26:01,170 --> 01:26:06,299
And that's where all the Chaos is hiding the Chaos is hiding in what's irrelevant

1133
01:26:07,130 --> 01:26:12,500
And so and that's very interesting observation because since the Chaos is virtually infant

1134
01:26:12,500 --> 01:26:14,540
I think surreal questions where the hell, do you put it?

1135
01:26:14,639 --> 01:26:16,520
Well you put it in what you ignore

1136
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:21,949
and you can ignore it as long as it isn't actively interfering with your movement forward you can assume that it's

1137
01:26:22,980 --> 01:26:28,040
That it doesn't matter that it in matter that it doesn't matter same thing

1138
01:26:29,850 --> 01:26:35,989
Alright, so here's the kicker. There's one more class of things that you can run into along the way

1139
01:26:35,989 --> 01:26:39,799
And this is where the chaos breaks through so let's say

1140
01:26:45,810 --> 01:26:47,959
you're moving from point a to point B and

1141
01:26:49,170 --> 01:26:51,920
Something that you don't expect oh curves

1142
01:26:52,739 --> 01:26:54,859
and it gets in the way, so let's

1143
01:26:56,100 --> 01:27:00,469
Say that you're living with someone and maybe you kind of like them. You're not married

1144
01:27:00,510 --> 01:27:04,610
So you don't like them that much because otherwise you'd ask them to marry you, but anyways

1145
01:27:06,870 --> 01:27:13,669
and so high quarter of youth is looking for something better and 3/4 of view is half satisfied something like that and

1146
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:18,320
Then a person because we're ambivalent about such things and then the person

1147
01:27:18,449 --> 01:27:22,219
You discover or the person announces that they'd be having an affair, okay?

1148
01:27:22,860 --> 01:27:26,150
So then how are you supposed to respond emotionally to that?

1149
01:27:26,489 --> 01:27:31,579
well the part of you that wasn't all that committed to the relationship is kind of exhilarated by that and then the

1150
01:27:31,770 --> 01:27:37,310
3/4 of you that's half satisfied is hurt and and you're going to exploit that part for sure in the ensuing

1151
01:27:37,530 --> 01:27:42,679
discussions and not mention the oh that's kind of exciting that you you know betrayed me that way, so

1152
01:27:43,590 --> 01:27:45,120
so

1153
01:27:45,120 --> 01:27:48,589
But the point is is that you that's a whole now

1154
01:27:48,590 --> 01:27:50,489
What's happened as a whole has?

1155
01:27:50,489 --> 01:27:56,928
You have this structure that you're walking on like ice like the thin ice that you're skating on and now there's a hole in it

1156
01:27:57,080 --> 01:28:01,309
And the hole we don't even know how deep the hole is but you know there's a hole there

1157
01:28:01,310 --> 01:28:07,100
And so now you're anxious about it though. Maybe also a little bit excited because God only knows what's down there, but

1158
01:28:07,679 --> 01:28:12,769
But you don't know what to do with that hole because it could spread very badly on you

1159
01:28:12,770 --> 01:28:16,819
it could be that you know the whole relationship was a facade and

1160
01:28:17,639 --> 01:28:20,119
That all your relationships have been facade facade

1161
01:28:20,540 --> 01:28:26,330
and that the reason that is is because you're so damn shallow that it's impossible for you to have a relationship that isn't just a

1162
01:28:26,330 --> 01:28:31,999
Facade and that's partly because you don't pay any attention to other people and it's also partly because your malevolent and selfish

1163
01:28:32,130 --> 01:28:37,880
So that's a nasty thing to discover or maybe that's the sort of person that you're attracting which would make sense

1164
01:28:38,130 --> 01:28:41,120
Actually if that's the sort of person that you are and so

1165
01:28:41,489 --> 01:28:47,899
So there are certain things that you can encounter that basically unglue you and what happens is that those?

1166
01:28:48,150 --> 01:28:52,430
moments of being unglued travel up that entire Hierarchy of presuppositions

1167
01:28:52,680 --> 01:28:57,709
It's like because the one of the logical conclusions to being betrayed in a relationship

1168
01:28:57,710 --> 01:29:01,399
Is that you are that you're truly a bad person now another?

1169
01:29:03,420 --> 01:29:10,040
Equally logical conclusion is that the person that you're with is really a bad person and another logical conclusion is all

1170
01:29:10,260 --> 01:29:13,340
People are truly bad people you know I mean

1171
01:29:14,130 --> 01:29:15,720
it in

1172
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:19,759
Microwaves out in microwaves, you can't trust anyone you can't trust women you can't trust men

1173
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:24,950
You can't trust human beings you can't trust yourself. The whole place is a catastrophe. It's a nightmare

1174
01:29:25,530 --> 01:29:27,530
Well, then you can fall through into

1175
01:29:28,110 --> 01:29:33,799
Chaos now the way your body responds to that when some or maybe you know you're supposed to be getting a promotion at work

1176
01:29:33,800 --> 01:29:34,489
That's good

1177
01:29:34,489 --> 01:29:36,679
You're all chipper about the promotion at work

1178
01:29:36,680 --> 01:29:42,049
And you you walk into your boss's office because he or she wants to see you and they say

1179
01:29:42,870 --> 01:29:47,059
wow, you know we've reviewed your performance over the last Few years and

1180
01:29:47,910 --> 01:29:49,970
your performance has been

1181
01:29:51,780 --> 01:29:56,509
Somewhere between mediocre and decent and we're downsizing and see you later

1182
01:29:58,830 --> 01:30:01,399
That's not a raise or a promotion. That's for sure

1183
01:30:02,040 --> 01:30:07,489
Not so whole that you fall into and the question is well. What do you make of that right?

1184
01:30:07,770 --> 01:30:09,890
How do you frame that how do you take that?

1185
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:16,669
Emergent Chaos and make habitable order out of you. Don't know is the whole capitalist system rotten to the core

1186
01:30:16,710 --> 01:30:19,819
I mean that's a convenient explanation under those circumstances

1187
01:30:20,190 --> 01:30:23,839
That's for sure were you working for a pSychopathic son of a bitch?

1188
01:30:23,970 --> 01:30:29,779
Did you make the wrong choice in University and was that your father's fault because you never did what you want?

1189
01:30:29,780 --> 01:30:33,020
Or was it your fault for not standing up to them or is it a dying?

1190
01:30:33,600 --> 01:30:35,270
Industry, or is maybe this a wake-up

1191
01:30:35,270 --> 01:30:40,520
Call that you should go do something else that you've been waiting to do you know that you've actually wanted to do your whole life

1192
01:30:40,520 --> 01:30:43,640
And that's why you're doing such a miserable job at your current

1193
01:30:43,830 --> 01:30:47,330
Occupation because you're bitter and resentful about the fact that you never did what you want

1194
01:30:47,790 --> 01:30:50,600
you don't know it's all of those things at once and

1195
01:30:50,670 --> 01:30:57,200
That's very stressful because all of those things at once is too many things and that's the reimburse of Chaos

1196
01:30:57,420 --> 01:30:59,420
That's the flood

1197
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:04,879
That's the return to the beginning of the cosmos that's another way that it's been represented mythologically

1198
01:31:04,880 --> 01:31:11,000
It's that you voyage all the way back to the beginning of the cosmos when there's nothing but undifferentiated Chaos

1199
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:14,689
And that's what you're confronting and maybe it's too much for you

1200
01:31:14,690 --> 01:31:19,069
And it's often it is I mean that that can really that can be traumatizing

1201
01:31:19,710 --> 01:31:21,950
It can hurt your brain you know

1202
01:31:21,950 --> 01:31:25,399
It's just too much for you to bear but it doesn't matter you're stuck with it

1203
01:31:25,430 --> 01:31:28,189
And so how do you respond to that? Well some of it is?

1204
01:31:28,710 --> 01:31:30,710
catastrophic negative emotion

1205
01:31:30,720 --> 01:31:34,069
You freeze and that's protective, and maybe you don't even want to move you

1206
01:31:34,070 --> 01:31:36,410
Don't want to bloody well get out of bed for a week

1207
01:31:36,410 --> 01:31:39,499
And that's because your body is reacting as if the bedroom

1208
01:31:39,600 --> 01:31:43,999
Floor is covered with snakes and the best thing for you to do is just not move just freeze

1209
01:31:44,220 --> 01:31:48,019
Not a pleasant situation to be in because it's you're hyper aroused

1210
01:31:48,780 --> 01:31:54,860
Very very physiologically demanding, and there's zero about if it's productive except maybe the snakes won't see you

1211
01:31:54,860 --> 01:31:57,560
But they've already seen you so that isn't helping very well

1212
01:31:57,560 --> 01:31:59,560
So you've got all this undifferentiated

1213
01:31:59,760 --> 01:32:06,080
negative emotion anxiety fear Hurt anger Guilt Shame emotional pain the whole plethora of

1214
01:32:06,360 --> 01:32:12,500
Catastrophes, and then maybe on the other side lurking down there is thank God I'm done without you oughta

1215
01:32:12,500 --> 01:32:18,470
Just bloody well hate it. I dragged myself off to work every day, and there's a little part of my soul

1216
01:32:18,470 --> 01:32:22,970
That's a goddamn. Happy. I finally got fired that I can hardly stand it. You know

1217
01:32:22,970 --> 01:32:28,399
Maybe you don't even admit that to yourself because well that would mean that all that time you spent at the job was just some

1218
01:32:28,400 --> 01:32:35,870
Cost you're deluding yourself. The whole time. I mean isn't an interesting thing to consider though sometimes if you're in the unpleasant

1219
01:32:36,480 --> 01:32:38,480
circumstance of having to fire someone

1220
01:32:38,760 --> 01:32:42,650
You know sometimes firing someone is the best thing that can happen to them which?

1221
01:32:42,810 --> 01:32:45,739
Doesn't mean that. You should go out and like enjoy it

1222
01:32:46,610 --> 01:32:50,860
Although I have met very disagreeable people who actually enjoyed firing people

1223
01:32:50,989 --> 01:32:54,368
I'll tell you a story about that at some point because it's quite interesting

1224
01:32:54,369 --> 01:32:59,409
but you know sometimes if someone's just limping along in their job and doing it as

1225
01:33:00,110 --> 01:33:06,009
Miserably and wretchedly as they possibly can imagine the best thing you can do to them for them is to say you know

1226
01:33:06,920 --> 01:33:08,719
You're failing at this

1227
01:33:08,719 --> 01:33:14,859
And and that doesn't necessarily mean that you would have to be failing it absolutely everything else in the entire world

1228
01:33:14,929 --> 01:33:20,739
so maybe you should just accept the dam failure and go off and try something new and I mean that's

1229
01:33:20,869 --> 01:33:23,349
terrifying for people and I know they hate it and all that but

1230
01:33:24,830 --> 01:33:31,600
but but sometimes it's better than the alternative which is just slow torturous death, so

1231
01:33:34,969 --> 01:33:36,969
Here's a funny way of looking at it

1232
01:33:37,280 --> 01:33:39,429
So let's say you fall right in for that

1233
01:33:39,830 --> 01:33:46,749
Hole that's underneath any everything and you've hit an anomaly that you don't understand you say, what's that anomaly made out of?

1234
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:52,540
Exactly, I know that's a strange way of thinking about it. You know because it's not what you could say

1235
01:33:53,270 --> 01:33:57,549
We'll just go along with that. It's a metaphor. What's that anomaly made out it well

1236
01:33:57,550 --> 01:33:59,920
Here's a way of thinking, but it's made out of spirited matter

1237
01:34:00,530 --> 01:34:02,210
And here's why?

1238
01:34:02,210 --> 01:34:05,469
This is something I learned in part from Piaget said

1239
01:34:06,230 --> 01:34:11,290
What's made out of matter because of course that's the world matter and the world is also

1240
01:34:11,290 --> 01:34:13,290
What matters and so that's kind of a nice?

1241
01:34:13,790 --> 01:34:16,749
duality there, but it's made out of spirit because

1242
01:34:17,270 --> 01:34:23,350
When you encounter something anomalous and go down the rabbit hole when you go into the underworld that's underneath everything that you've relied on

1243
01:34:24,050 --> 01:34:27,130
You learn things down there, so what's down there is information

1244
01:34:27,889 --> 01:34:32,409
And that's now it's maybe way more information than you want, but it is information

1245
01:34:32,440 --> 01:34:39,669
It's information and what can what can you do with the information you can inform yourself with the information

1246
01:34:39,670 --> 01:34:41,670
Right you could put yourself in

1247
01:34:42,350 --> 01:34:43,969
formation with the

1248
01:34:43,969 --> 01:34:46,059
information that's helpful too and

1249
01:34:46,340 --> 01:34:47,810
So and you think well

1250
01:34:47,810 --> 01:34:52,959
You you're a psyche if you're not a spirit it depends on you know whether you're a materialist or not

1251
01:34:52,960 --> 01:34:56,889
But at least we can say that you're a psyche the question is what's your pSyChe made up?

1252
01:34:56,929 --> 01:35:03,828
Well, it's obviously go out of material some right, but the matter happens to be arrayed in a particular order

1253
01:35:03,829 --> 01:35:05,839
And that's an information order

1254
01:35:05,840 --> 01:35:11,239
And so when you fall into the underworld that's underneath everything and you encounter that latent information

1255
01:35:11,239 --> 01:35:17,149
Then what you can do is enhance your psyche you can grow your spirit because what you do is you take the new?

1256
01:35:17,400 --> 01:35:19,020
information and you

1257
01:35:19,020 --> 01:35:22,549
Incorporate it. That's like eating the apple that out of an eve it you

1258
01:35:22,679 --> 01:35:28,009
Incorporate that and that makes more of you, and that's not a metaphorical or a metaphysical proposition

1259
01:35:28,010 --> 01:35:35,300
It's not to say nothing other than well. That's what happens when children learn you think what happens Charles's three has a pretty low resolution

1260
01:35:36,780 --> 01:35:40,039
representation of the world and is a fairly low resolution

1261
01:35:40,650 --> 01:35:46,219
Human being got all the constituent elements there, but isn't differentiated in any tremendous Manner

1262
01:35:46,219 --> 01:35:50,328
That's all still to come in the future and so what if the child do explore

1263
01:35:50,639 --> 01:35:57,589
What do they explore things they don't understand that's where the information is because you already understand. What you understand?

1264
01:35:57,590 --> 01:36:03,469
There's no information there you go where there where you don't understand that's where the information is and out of that information

1265
01:36:03,469 --> 01:36:07,459
You generate a higher resolution world and you generate a higher resolution?

1266
01:36:07,770 --> 01:36:12,799
Self and so out of the combat with the underlying dragon of Chaos you

1267
01:36:13,110 --> 01:36:16,969
Generate spirit and matter and that's what you do when you go down into the underworld

1268
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:19,679
so if it doesn't kill you

1269
01:36:19,679 --> 01:36:22,999
Or if it doesn't make you wish you were dead which you probably will

1270
01:36:23,250 --> 01:36:25,849
But there's a bunch of you that has to die down there anyway

1271
01:36:25,849 --> 01:36:30,529
So maybe that's not such a bad thing because if you had this relationship that ended in Betrayal

1272
01:36:30,599 --> 01:36:36,979
Then there's something that's just not exactly right right there's something that wentz and the reason I'm saying that think well

1273
01:36:36,980 --> 01:36:42,139
That's kind of moralistic. It's like actually I don't mind being moralistic in case you haven't noticed but

1274
01:36:42,900 --> 01:36:46,639
But that's not it's not a fair comment, because you're playing this stupid game

1275
01:36:47,010 --> 01:36:50,599
It's like you live with someone in fidelity

1276
01:36:50,880 --> 01:36:58,489
That's the game right you've decided the rules with the game comes a morality the morality are the rules of the game well

1277
01:36:58,489 --> 01:37:00,859
Then the thing collapses into infidelity

1278
01:37:01,170 --> 01:37:03,409
It's like well you played the game wrong

1279
01:37:03,409 --> 01:37:09,589
or it was the wrong game one of those two you it's one of those two you pick the damn game and

1280
01:37:09,809 --> 01:37:11,730
Having picked the game you can't

1281
01:37:11,730 --> 01:37:18,450
Say well, no those aren't the rules it's like yeah. Yeah, if you pick the game you pick the rules and if you fail at

1282
01:37:19,090 --> 01:37:23,489
Complying with the rule then you fail now you could say well, I could pick a different game. It's like

1283
01:37:23,489 --> 01:37:28,859
I don't care how you solve the problem. You're still stuck with the problem. It's a moral problem fundamentally

1284
01:37:31,330 --> 01:37:35,700
and it might take some major-league retooling to to fix it, so

1285
01:37:38,710 --> 01:37:40,420
you're at point A

1286
01:37:40,420 --> 01:37:44,640
Trying to get to point B. That's not working out you hit an anomaly

1287
01:37:45,220 --> 01:37:47,849
You're not getting the point b. That's for sure

1288
01:37:49,150 --> 01:37:55,980
Your medical school student you write your mcAts which is a test you have to write to go to medical school you get 25th

1289
01:37:56,140 --> 01:37:58,080
Percentile, I don't know who you are

1290
01:37:58,080 --> 01:38:03,269
But you're not a pre-med student and maybe you never were right, and that's the Rub man

1291
01:38:03,270 --> 01:38:08,669
And so who the hell are you you don't know collapse down here into this

1292
01:38:09,040 --> 01:38:13,169
motivational conflict this place of motivation unemotional uncertainty and

1293
01:38:13,870 --> 01:38:20,700
Tremendous information, right it's a place of transformation. It's the Phoenix that burns. It's the burning part of the Phoenix that burns

1294
01:38:20,700 --> 01:38:24,089
It's it's the journey to the underworld. It's the journey to hell

1295
01:38:24,090 --> 01:38:27,870
It can really be a journey to hell because you may find out that the reason

1296
01:38:27,940 --> 01:38:34,290
That your partner betrayed you or that you didn't get your damn promotions because there's seriously something wrong with you

1297
01:38:34,290 --> 01:38:37,229
And you know it, and I don't just mean that you don't know what you're doing

1298
01:38:37,230 --> 01:38:39,870
I mean that there's 25 percent of you that is

1299
01:38:39,970 --> 01:38:45,659
Seriously aiming at things not being good and so you fall into the underworld and you find out that oh

1300
01:38:46,870 --> 01:38:54,599
God, I just got exactly what I was aiming for or I got exactly what the worst part of me was aiming for and that

1301
01:38:54,600 --> 01:38:56,489
Worst part that's something to clean up

1302
01:38:56,489 --> 01:39:03,329
And that's not going to be easy because it's got it tooks to me like something something ferocious something seriously ferocious

1303
01:39:03,330 --> 01:39:08,999
And I've been toying with it for a very long time and maybe I can't even detach it anymore

1304
01:39:09,000 --> 01:39:11,009
And so that's not so fun

1305
01:39:11,010 --> 01:39:16,890
And you see people like that in psychotherapy very frequently or you see them wandering around on the streets like

1306
01:39:17,710 --> 01:39:18,730
Absolute

1307
01:39:18,730 --> 01:39:25,560
Catastrophic former shells of themselves, you know because they've hit the underworld and they ended up in hell, and there's no getting out

1308
01:39:25,800 --> 01:39:30,000
So those are the people you tend to give a wide berth to when you walk down the street

1309
01:39:30,000 --> 01:39:32,000
So there you are down in underworld

1310
01:39:32,560 --> 01:39:34,979
right back where the latent information

1311
01:39:35,740 --> 01:39:37,740
exists and just too much of it and

1312
01:39:38,620 --> 01:39:44,640
That's this it's the same thing. It's the same thing and that's why the Adam and eve story is archetypal

1313
01:39:45,190 --> 01:39:46,720
right because

1314
01:39:46,720 --> 01:39:48,250
We're always

1315
01:39:48,250 --> 01:39:55,260
Ingesting something new that knocks us into a new state of self-consciousness, and it's always a catastrophic

1316
01:39:57,130 --> 01:40:01,950
demolition of our current of our previous paradise insufficient as that paradise was

1317
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:07,950
Something comes along to destroy it and knocks the slats out of our life, and that's a voyage to the underworld

1318
01:40:11,020 --> 01:40:13,169
out of the walled Garden into Chaos

1319
01:40:17,230 --> 01:40:19,230
And so what is all of that?

1320
01:40:22,630 --> 01:40:25,589
Well, there's lots of ways of construing it it's a it's

1321
01:40:26,350 --> 01:40:28,350
a frame transformation

1322
01:40:29,050 --> 01:40:34,710
There's a walled city. It's got a hole in it because all walled cities have holes in them right because everything's imperfect

1323
01:40:34,710 --> 01:40:36,240
And that's where the Chaos comes up

1324
01:40:36,240 --> 01:40:42,029
And then maybe you go out there like a hero to fight the Chaos and to reestablish the frame

1325
01:40:42,030 --> 01:40:46,170
That's what you're supposed to do and maybe you free some information while you're doing that

1326
01:40:48,490 --> 01:40:56,189
Or maybe you establish your relationship, and so that's the Journey frame damage Chaos

1327
01:40:57,520 --> 01:40:59,520
Voluntary Confrontation

1328
01:40:59,710 --> 01:41:01,950
reconstitution of the world and that's

1329
01:41:02,590 --> 01:41:05,640
That's human existence, and hopefully it's not just a little

1330
01:41:06,340 --> 01:41:08,340
Linear it's it's

1331
01:41:09,100 --> 01:41:11,189
Stepwise right is that?

1332
01:41:12,580 --> 01:41:20,129
the you that emerges as a consequence of your latest catastrophe is everything that you were before plus something more and

1333
01:41:20,590 --> 01:41:24,390
That actually constitutes what you might describe as measurable progress

1334
01:41:25,150 --> 01:41:28,260
right and that's another argument against Moral relativism because

1335
01:41:29,470 --> 01:41:35,279
If you can do everything that you could do before and you can do some more things. We could just define that as better

1336
01:41:35,320 --> 01:41:39,510
It's not a bad definition, and then we have up. It's like what you're trying to do is to

1337
01:41:41,200 --> 01:41:43,120
differentiate the world

1338
01:41:43,120 --> 01:41:44,410
and

1339
01:41:44,410 --> 01:41:50,040
Differentiate yourself and every time you undergo one of these revolutions, then hopefully both of those things happen

1340
01:41:50,040 --> 01:41:52,859
and then there's a moral to that story too, which is

1341
01:41:53,740 --> 01:41:55,860
Do it voluntarily and maybe do it?

1342
01:41:58,360 --> 01:42:00,779
Don't wait for it to happen catastrophic. Ly

1343
01:42:01,780 --> 01:42:06,599
Keep your eyes open and when something goes a little bit wrong that you could fix

1344
01:42:07,270 --> 01:42:10,319
Fix it don't say no that doesn't matter

1345
01:42:11,230 --> 01:42:13,559
Maybe it does matter. Maybe it is matter

1346
01:42:13,560 --> 01:42:16,470
Maybe it's exactly the matter out of which you should be built

1347
01:42:16,710 --> 01:42:22,409
Maybe it's the matter out of which the world should be built and if part of you is telling you it matters

1348
01:42:23,290 --> 01:42:28,799
What it means is that that part is telling you that there's something there that you need to

1349
01:42:29,140 --> 01:42:32,099
Engage with that's what it means for something to matter

1350
01:42:32,100 --> 01:42:37,050
I really get out of the kick a kick out of the word matter because it's got these two weird meanings, right?

1351
01:42:37,050 --> 01:42:39,050
there's the matter that everything is made out of

1352
01:42:39,580 --> 01:42:45,930
The materialists think everything is made out of and that's just dead matter and then there's the matter that life is made out of which

1353
01:42:45,930 --> 01:42:50,490
Is what matters and now and then you're moving through life and something matters?

1354
01:42:50,490 --> 01:42:51,600
It's calling to you

1355
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:56,730
And that's the unrevealed world trying to reveal itself to you and all you have to do is

1356
01:42:57,130 --> 01:43:02,849
Allow it to reveal itself to you, and then maybe what happens is that a minor shit?

1357
01:43:03,430 --> 01:43:05,790
Shifted shape is all that has to happen to you

1358
01:43:05,790 --> 01:43:09,989
You don't have to burn right down to the bloody egg and and hatch out

1359
01:43:09,990 --> 01:43:14,070
You know as a newborn maybe you can just repair a little bit of something

1360
01:43:14,070 --> 01:43:15,180
That's gone wrong with you

1361
01:43:15,180 --> 01:43:20,400
And so you can undergo a sequence of continual micro deaths instead of waiting for the bloody

1362
01:43:20,800 --> 01:43:23,909
catastrophe that might send you so far down that you'll never recover and

1363
01:43:23,980 --> 01:43:30,419
All you have to do is attend to what matters and your whole nervous system is it's doing this for you. You've got a goal

1364
01:43:31,060 --> 01:43:36,540
Something happens it matters. So what are you supposed to do with that you're supposed to you're supposed to fix it

1365
01:43:36,540 --> 01:43:42,389
You're supposed to engage with it. That's why it's calling out to you as if it matters. It's saying there's an

1366
01:43:42,910 --> 01:43:46,770
Indeterminate part of the world here that wants to manifest itself into fully

1367
01:43:47,140 --> 01:43:53,070
Articulated being and it's calling to you to do that and if you ignore it then it accumulates

1368
01:43:53,070 --> 01:43:59,309
And if accumulates it turns into the dragon of Chaos and then it waits until you're not at your best

1369
01:43:59,320 --> 01:44:02,189
And then it eats you and that's the alternative

1370
01:44:02,710 --> 01:44:06,660
So that seems like a bad plan unless you like being lunch meat

1371
01:44:07,390 --> 01:44:09,390
so

1372
01:44:13,060 --> 01:44:15,060
So that's a long introduction to Noah

1373
01:44:24,850 --> 01:44:29,459
But you need it. You know because you can't understand the story otherwise and so because

1374
01:44:30,520 --> 01:44:35,699
That's what the story is about and now we can go through the story relatively rapidly although

1375
01:44:35,699 --> 01:44:37,699
It doesn't look like we'll go through all of it tonight

1376
01:44:38,949 --> 01:44:41,699
Okay, so we'll start with the next section of genesis

1377
01:44:41,699 --> 01:44:46,979
And this is immediately after cain and Abel and there's a short story to begin with just a fragment

1378
01:44:46,980 --> 01:44:49,319
I called it giants of the Earth

1379
01:44:50,800 --> 01:44:54,300
And it came to pass when men began to multiply on the face of the Earth

1380
01:44:54,300 --> 01:44:58,590
So this is after cain and Abel that and daughters were born unto them

1381
01:44:59,710 --> 01:45:06,000
That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair and took them wives of all which they chose

1382
01:45:07,810 --> 01:45:08,860
and

1383
01:45:08,860 --> 01:45:15,750
The Lord said my spirit shall, not always strive with man for that he is also flesh yet his days will be

1384
01:45:16,300 --> 01:45:18,300
120 years

1385
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:24,719
There were giants in the earth in those days and also after that when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men

1386
01:45:24,719 --> 01:45:29,279
And they bare children to them the same became mighty, men which were of old men of Renown

1387
01:45:30,460 --> 01:45:34,770
Now there's been all sorts of attempts to interpret those few rather jumbled Lines

1388
01:45:36,130 --> 01:45:41,759
But I see it as a reflection of did a classic development of Hero Mythology

1389
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:46,260
Which is there and this is sort of Nostalgia for the past one of the things Mircea eliade. A--

1390
01:45:47,199 --> 01:45:49,199
pointed out was that

1391
01:45:49,930 --> 01:45:55,499
What happens to Human memory in Preliterate cultures because nothing is written down is that?

1392
01:45:56,080 --> 01:46:02,069
What needs to be preserved gets amalgamated and so imagine that you have a culture. That's based on fishing

1393
01:46:02,260 --> 01:46:06,180
Let's say so you have to be a good fisherman. You know and are

1394
01:46:07,000 --> 01:46:10,770
Human beings you use simple tools to fish are unbelievably good fishermen

1395
01:46:10,770 --> 01:46:17,219
They know every bloody thing you can possibly imagine about fish because otherwise they die so it's really important that they learn everything about fish

1396
01:46:17,219 --> 01:46:19,219
And maybe they've been fishing for like

1397
01:46:19,390 --> 01:46:25,379
13,000 years or something like that, so there's a lot of accumulated knowledge, and so then the question is well who taught?

1398
01:46:26,410 --> 01:46:28,919
mankind how to fish and the answer is

1399
01:46:29,650 --> 01:46:37,319
fragments of individuals across history, but not there, you know remember the damn fragments you put them all together into the amalgam of

1400
01:46:37,840 --> 01:46:39,840
The heroic Fisherman you know the guy who?

1401
01:46:40,040 --> 01:46:42,280
established the Pattern for proper fishing

1402
01:46:42,350 --> 01:46:48,160
whatever that pattern happens to be one of the patterns might be don't take all the damn fish because there won't be any for the

1403
01:46:48,160 --> 01:46:52,809
next year or something like that, but all those fragments of discovery get amalgamated into

1404
01:46:53,420 --> 01:47:00,040
Heroes of the past and then what you do if you're a fisherman is you act out the heroic fishermen of the past and so?

1405
01:47:00,040 --> 01:47:03,669
The idea that there were men of Renown or heroes in the past is

1406
01:47:04,610 --> 01:47:06,610
Just a fragmentary

1407
01:47:06,770 --> 01:47:07,760
What would you call?

1408
01:47:07,760 --> 01:47:12,849
It's just a fragment of that sequence of ideas that back in the past the remove

1409
01:47:13,280 --> 01:47:17,050
mighty human beings who established the proper patterns of

1410
01:47:17,690 --> 01:47:22,300
being and they were the sons of God who took the daughters of men to

1411
01:47:22,940 --> 01:47:26,230
Life now, and it's interesting too because we do know that

1412
01:47:27,320 --> 01:47:29,320
the more confident men are

1413
01:47:30,110 --> 01:47:32,110
disproportionately likely to leave

1414
01:47:32,960 --> 01:47:38,500
Offspring so it's a perfectly reasonable way of formulating the circumstance

1415
01:47:40,940 --> 01:47:46,720
Onto the flood this is from Virgil a leotta who wrote a book called the history of religious ideas

1416
01:47:46,720 --> 01:47:53,349
Which I would strongly recommend it to three volume set it's quite readable, and it's brilliant. It's brilliant. I I really like it

1417
01:47:54,230 --> 01:47:56,230
And this is what?

1418
01:47:56,420 --> 01:48:01,210
Ritchie Elias had to say about flood myths as it's been well known since the

1419
01:48:01,370 --> 01:48:07,180
Compilations made by our Andre h hughes Neurons JG. Fraser who wrote the Golden bough the deluge myth

1420
01:48:07,250 --> 01:48:14,379
The flood minute is almost universally disseminated it is documented on all the continents although very rarely in Africa

1421
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:16,720
particularly in the desert for

1422
01:48:17,060 --> 01:48:18,800
unsurprisingly

1423
01:48:18,800 --> 01:48:25,539
although and on various cultural levels a certain number of variants seem to be the result of dissemination rather than

1424
01:48:25,820 --> 01:48:29,020
spontaneous regeneration let's say first from Mesopotamia

1425
01:48:29,020 --> 01:48:36,129
And then from India it is equally possible that one or several diluvial catastrophes gave rise to fabulous narratives

1426
01:48:36,140 --> 01:48:40,749
But it would be risky to explain so widespread a myth by phenomena of which no Geological

1427
01:48:41,090 --> 01:48:46,930
Traces has been found well eliot wrote this quite a while ago. I think he wrote that book perhaps in the 80s

1428
01:48:46,930 --> 01:48:50,409
Maybe in the 70s, but since then there actually has been quite a bit of evidence

1429
01:48:51,880 --> 01:48:58,630
announced in various circles for the existence of catastrophic floods that occurred within the relative memory of human

1430
01:48:59,540 --> 01:49:04,479
Relative human civilization memory let's say, so the West coast Indians for example. I suppose

1431
01:49:04,480 --> 01:49:08,259
That's the wrong word the west coast. I don't know what to say

1432
01:49:09,020 --> 01:49:11,020
I know a

1433
01:49:11,540 --> 01:49:15,009
Croc Baccala carver who told me a flood story

1434
01:49:15,010 --> 01:49:20,770
And they have a story it's almost identical to the story of Noah except of course it involves giant canoes

1435
01:49:20,770 --> 01:49:22,580
But it's it's the same story

1436
01:49:22,580 --> 01:49:28,330
They release if I remember correctly a raven, but Noah releases a raven first

1437
01:49:28,330 --> 01:49:32,830
And then it dove once once the flood comes to an end and and it has a tower of babel issue

1438
01:49:33,020 --> 01:49:37,089
To the same story, so the canoes are all put together. It's not one giant canoe

1439
01:49:37,090 --> 01:49:39,730
it's a bunch of canoes all together be right out the flood and

1440
01:49:40,070 --> 01:49:42,850
Then the can you separate it and go all over the world

1441
01:49:42,850 --> 01:49:47,769
And that's why there are people all over the world so anyways the story is very widely disseminated

1442
01:49:48,199 --> 01:49:55,569
But you know there were floods in North America, not that long ago, so there are floods you can look up the Missoula floods

1443
01:49:56,360 --> 01:49:58,000
15,000 to 13,000 years ago

1444
01:49:58,000 --> 01:50:02,859
And the coracle are people have probably been on the west coast for something like thirteen to fourteen thousand years

1445
01:50:03,230 --> 01:50:08,799
so and you know you can you can maintain an oral tradition for a very very long time you think no, but

1446
01:50:09,560 --> 01:50:15,039
Traditional societies don't change that's where their traditional, and so they have the same stories over generations

1447
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:18,790
They remember the same stories, so when the Missoula

1448
01:50:19,460 --> 01:50:22,929
Floods which were a consequence of melting glacial ice

1449
01:50:23,750 --> 01:50:29,560
Discharged up too. They figure there were 55,000 55 of them between 15,000 and 13,000 years ago

1450
01:50:30,170 --> 01:50:35,920
discharged volumes up to 15 times the volume of the Amazon river, so these are major-league floods and then

1451
01:50:37,070 --> 01:50:43,270
Sears it all published a paper in 2008 called climate change in post-glacial human disperses in Southeast Asia

1452
01:50:43,940 --> 01:50:45,940
Claiming that there were multiple floods

1453
01:50:46,250 --> 01:50:50,709
Particularly affecting southeast Asia between 15,000 and 7,000 years ago

1454
01:50:50,710 --> 01:50:56,980
So there might Elliott it might be a bit wrong about the notion that there were no geological traces of such

1455
01:50:57,409 --> 01:51:03,609
Such catastrophic flooding, but anyways it doesn't matter because we're still looking at this from a psychological perspective, and that's fine

1456
01:51:04,280 --> 01:51:09,850
The majority of the lugnut seem in some sense to form part of the Cosmic rhythm the old world

1457
01:51:10,640 --> 01:51:12,669
people by a Fallen humanity is

1458
01:51:13,640 --> 01:51:15,640
submerged under the waters and

1459
01:51:15,739 --> 01:51:22,659
sometime later a new world Emerges from the aquatic Chaos in large number of variants the flood is the result of the sins or

1460
01:51:22,969 --> 01:51:29,229
Ritual faults of human beings sometimes its results simply from the wish of a divine being to put an end to mankind

1461
01:51:29,660 --> 01:51:34,180
The chief causes lie at once in the sins of men and the decrepitude of the world

1462
01:51:34,790 --> 01:51:36,790
It's a brilliant analysis

1463
01:51:37,730 --> 01:51:39,730
Partly because it puts it

1464
01:51:40,070 --> 01:51:42,430
it draws its lovely parallel between

1465
01:51:43,160 --> 01:51:47,979
Which I mentioned a bit earlier between the fact that things go wrong all by themselves

1466
01:51:48,140 --> 01:51:51,039
But that you can speed that along by not paying any attention

1467
01:51:51,200 --> 01:51:55,029
You know so if you're in a relationship, you know relationship takes an awful

1468
01:51:55,030 --> 01:51:55,540
lot of Maintenance

1469
01:51:55,540 --> 01:51:57,370
And you know what it means?

1470
01:51:57,370 --> 01:52:03,729
Needs to be maintained because you start developing some distance from the person that you have the relationship with and then that starts to become

1471
01:52:03,830 --> 01:52:07,299
tinged with a little bit of dislike and hopefully not contempt

1472
01:52:07,300 --> 01:52:13,810
But a little bit of dislike, and maybe some some some emotional distance and you feel that and you think well

1473
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:15,430
It's hard to tell what you think

1474
01:52:15,430 --> 01:52:21,189
but you feel that anyways you know that that's emerged and so then you have a chance at at that point to

1475
01:52:21,980 --> 01:52:23,600
repair

1476
01:52:23,600 --> 01:52:28,419
Whatever's gone wrong, and that would require some retooling on both of your parts

1477
01:52:28,420 --> 01:52:34,239
maybe one more one person more than the other but whatever we would require a serious discussion like look I've

1478
01:52:34,340 --> 01:52:36,370
noticed that this has been happening and

1479
01:52:37,190 --> 01:52:39,070
Maybe it's you, and maybe it's me

1480
01:52:39,070 --> 01:52:43,690
And we should probably figure it out because if it was you that be convenient and everything, but if it was me

1481
01:52:43,760 --> 01:52:45,590
then I'd like to fix it because

1482
01:52:45,590 --> 01:52:46,930
Then it would be fixed

1483
01:52:46,930 --> 01:52:50,139
And so that's why you listen to your partner because they might tell you that there's something

1484
01:52:50,300 --> 01:52:55,210
Stupid about you that you don't know and then if you could fix that then you wouldn't have to be stupid in that way anymore

1485
01:52:55,210 --> 01:52:57,580
And it's actually one of the real useful

1486
01:52:57,580 --> 01:53:05,019
It's one of the genuinely useful features of having a partner because you really want to be stupid and then continue to repeat your mistakes

1487
01:53:05,200 --> 01:53:06,940
Ad nauseam for the rest of your life?

1488
01:53:06,940 --> 01:53:09,940
I know it's more convenient to do that than to have a you know

1489
01:53:10,370 --> 01:53:18,279
Knockdown drag them out arguments about just exactly why you're stupid and how you could fix it, but still it's better to have the argument

1490
01:53:20,400 --> 01:53:26,390
So the chief causes lye at once and the sins of man in the decrepitude of the world and the sins there are generally either

1491
01:53:27,480 --> 01:53:28,890
acts of

1492
01:53:28,890 --> 01:53:35,479
Commission where people do things that they know to be wrong or they fail to do things that they know would be right?

1493
01:53:35,550 --> 01:53:37,170
Doesn't really matter

1494
01:53:37,170 --> 01:53:41,779
Sins of Commission are usually judged more harshly say within the Judeo-Christian tradition

1495
01:53:41,850 --> 01:53:46,160
But I think there might be a bit of an error in that because sins of omission can be a real catastrophe

1496
01:53:46,290 --> 01:53:50,269
And so here's the flood idea you tell me what you think about this

1497
01:53:50,270 --> 01:53:52,399
so you know so there's this idea that a

1498
01:53:52,740 --> 01:53:59,449
Judgmental being will flood you out if you continue on your wayward ways and that seems like a little bit of you know

1499
01:53:59,450 --> 01:54:01,440
it's one of the examples of

1500
01:54:01,440 --> 01:54:06,410
Jehova being a little on the harsh side in the old testament not something that modern people really

1501
01:54:07,200 --> 01:54:09,709
approve of so much because we like our God sort of

1502
01:54:10,650 --> 01:54:12,650
domesticated let's put it that way and

1503
01:54:14,100 --> 01:54:16,910
unfortunately that isn't how it tends to work, but I've often thought about

1504
01:54:17,880 --> 01:54:19,940
the reaction in North America to

1505
01:54:20,970 --> 01:54:22,970
the Hurricane end

1506
01:54:23,820 --> 01:54:25,680
in

1507
01:54:25,680 --> 01:54:27,240
New Orleans

1508
01:54:27,240 --> 01:54:30,619
Because there's two ways of reading that right one is mother nature

1509
01:54:31,860 --> 01:54:37,640
has a little fit and sends a hurricane in to new Orleans and wipes everyone out and isn't that a

1510
01:54:37,950 --> 01:54:40,189
catastrophe and isn't that an example of

1511
01:54:41,700 --> 01:54:45,649
isn't that example of our fragility in the force in the face of

1512
01:54:46,800 --> 01:54:48,180
natural

1513
01:54:48,180 --> 01:54:52,999
Power, but it is another way of reading it. Maybe this is unfair, but it'll do for the purpose of illustration

1514
01:54:53,160 --> 01:54:56,779
It's like you know the dutch build dikes right to keep the ocean back

1515
01:54:57,150 --> 01:55:02,930
And they're actually pretty effective at that because their countries mostly underwater and it turns out that if you go to Holland

1516
01:55:02,930 --> 01:55:04,470
It's actually not underwater

1517
01:55:04,470 --> 01:55:09,589
and so their dikes are working and so the dutch were very organized people and

1518
01:55:09,780 --> 01:55:15,740
They better be because their country is supposed to be underwater right so you better be organized if your country is supposed to be underwater

1519
01:55:15,740 --> 01:55:22,429
And so they are very organized and they have a rule for their dikes. Which is they try to estimate the worst possible

1520
01:55:23,370 --> 01:55:25,370
Oceanic storm that will come in

1521
01:55:26,280 --> 01:55:31,019
10,000 years and make sure that the dikes will withstand that well

1522
01:55:32,019 --> 01:55:39,059
from my reading the Army Corps of engineers in new Orleans built the dykes for a storm every hundred years and

1523
01:55:39,760 --> 01:55:42,630
That's not so good because we live about

1524
01:55:43,360 --> 01:55:45,509
80 years let's say so that means the

1525
01:55:45,639 --> 01:55:51,538
Probability that one of those storms is going to come lip and buy in a lifespan is pretty damn high and then so that

1526
01:55:51,699 --> 01:55:53,469
Perhaps wasn't

1527
01:55:53,469 --> 01:56:00,419
The wisest of planning especially because some of new Orleans is actually supposed to be underwater, and then worse you know

1528
01:56:00,610 --> 01:56:01,650
Mississippi is a state

1529
01:56:01,650 --> 01:56:03,539
That's quite well known for its corruption

1530
01:56:03,539 --> 01:56:08,129
And so you might also say the tremendous amount of the money and time and resources that

1531
01:56:08,260 --> 01:56:15,090
could have and should have and was planned to go towards fixing the problem didn't and

1532
01:56:15,460 --> 01:56:17,039
so the hurricane came along

1533
01:56:17,039 --> 01:56:20,429
and oh my God wasn't it a natural disaster and the

1534
01:56:20,739 --> 01:56:24,899
Question is what bloody well makes you so sure that it was a natural disaster

1535
01:56:25,539 --> 01:56:30,449
Right because if the infrastructure would have been maintained and built to the specifications

1536
01:56:30,789 --> 01:56:38,309
that were certainly technically possible and would have actually been less expensive in the long run to build and everyone knew it and

1537
01:56:38,829 --> 01:56:44,909
The Hurricane came along and way build the city. Why do you think that's a natural disaster to me. That's a that's a

1538
01:56:45,489 --> 01:56:46,749
natural

1539
01:56:46,749 --> 01:56:52,499
example if you think about it from a metaphorical perspective of a judgmental God

1540
01:56:53,889 --> 01:56:55,889
Deciding to use a flood

1541
01:56:56,230 --> 01:57:02,219
To teach a moral lesson and you might say well, that's pretty hard. What about all those flood survivors at sea

1542
01:57:02,219 --> 01:57:05,038
I care well the whole flood thing was kind of harsh and

1543
01:57:05,380 --> 01:57:08,579
so pointing out that there were steps that could have been taken and and

1544
01:57:09,099 --> 01:57:14,849
Also that I dealt in the aftermath have been taken even though everyone knows now

1545
01:57:15,519 --> 01:57:17,519
exactly what had happened is

1546
01:57:19,719 --> 01:57:23,578
You might consider it a diagnosis, but it's irrelevant because what I'm what

1547
01:57:23,579 --> 01:57:29,399
I'm really trying to tell you is how the mythological stories would line up on this because you can tell a story about mother nature

1548
01:57:30,940 --> 01:57:32,940
manifesting her

1549
01:57:32,980 --> 01:57:38,039
catastrophe and potential for tragedy or you can tell another story of an absolute failure of the

1550
01:57:38,769 --> 01:57:43,079
Human Social structure and the human individual level

1551
01:57:43,780 --> 01:57:51,659
Because of the corruption to address a problem that everyone knew was there, and so that's a good example of how things

1552
01:57:52,210 --> 01:57:54,629
How the flood comes when you're not behaving properly?

1553
01:57:55,390 --> 01:57:59,729
You know and one of the things that's quite interesting about the old testament and the people who wrote it

1554
01:57:59,730 --> 01:58:03,659
Is that they always assume that if the flood comes that meant you weren't prepared?

1555
01:58:04,390 --> 01:58:11,249
If that's the rule right that's it's like the a priori axiom. I think you got flooded out. Hey, you weren't prepared enough

1556
01:58:11,320 --> 01:58:17,310
How can you tell well you got flooded out right? That's the evidence and you might say well. That's not very fair

1557
01:58:17,310 --> 01:58:22,679
It's like fair isn't the point the point is do you want to get flooded out again or not?

1558
01:58:23,290 --> 01:58:27,509
Because fair would be well you better figure out why you got flooded out and fix it

1559
01:58:27,510 --> 01:58:32,850
so it doesn't happen again, and that's the moral thing to do when you're thinking about morality as

1560
01:58:33,699 --> 01:58:39,779
Walking the path. It's most appropriate to get to the destination that you think would be the best possible destination

1561
01:58:42,159 --> 01:58:45,449
By the mere fact that it exists that is

1562
01:58:45,909 --> 01:58:50,579
It lives and produces the cosmos gradually deteriorate syd ends by falling into decay

1563
01:58:51,550 --> 01:58:57,120
That is the reason why it has to be recreated in other words the flood realizes on the Macro cosmic scale

1564
01:58:57,130 --> 01:59:00,089
What is symbolically affected during the New Year festival?

1565
01:59:00,280 --> 01:59:05,730
the end of the world and the end of the sinful humanity in order to make a new creation possible

1566
01:59:06,370 --> 01:59:11,789
Well that's an interesting there's a lot of information packed into those few lines the daily added wrote because he also

1567
01:59:12,550 --> 01:59:13,870
had

1568
01:59:13,870 --> 01:59:15,870
in that in the mesopotamian

1569
01:59:16,659 --> 01:59:18,659
rituals

1570
01:59:19,390 --> 01:59:21,539
the Mesopotamians would act out

1571
01:59:23,230 --> 01:59:29,399
The collapse of the kingdom into Chaos essentially at the New Year's festival. It's kind of what you do when you

1572
01:59:29,980 --> 01:59:36,299
make resolutions because like it's a degenerate what you'd say is our proclivity to make New Year's resolution is sort of a

1573
01:59:36,489 --> 01:59:39,329
Degenerate ritual and I don't mean that it's bad. I mean that

1574
01:59:40,210 --> 01:59:42,719
It's the remnants of something much grander

1575
01:59:43,630 --> 01:59:49,469
so the idea was well the mesopotamians would take their emperor outside the city the walled City and

1576
01:59:49,870 --> 01:59:54,419
Once a year, and they would make a meal and they'd take off all his king clothes

1577
01:59:54,489 --> 01:59:58,098
And then they'd whack them with if I remember correctly the priest would do that

1578
01:59:58,099 --> 02:00:02,748
And then they make him recount all the ways that he wasn't being a good emperor that year

1579
02:00:02,749 --> 02:00:06,319
He wasn't being a good marduk because that was who he was supposed to be on Earth

1580
02:00:06,320 --> 02:00:11,869
And that's the guy with eyes all the way around his head speaks Magic words and transforms Chaos into order

1581
02:00:12,170 --> 02:00:16,699
That's what vampire is supposed to do and so the question would be okay your emperor. It's like

1582
02:00:17,429 --> 02:00:22,069
Have a little humility here because you're not god incarnate you probably made some mistakes

1583
02:00:22,070 --> 02:00:25,820
Can you think of any ways in the last year that you didn't take every?

1584
02:00:26,429 --> 02:00:33,348
Advantage of every opportunity you possibly could have to take some spare Chaos and transform it into a bit of habitable order

1585
02:00:33,510 --> 02:00:35,150
That's a good thing to think about well

1586
02:00:35,150 --> 02:00:38,659
That's what you're thinking about when you make a new Year's resolution even though you don't know it

1587
02:00:38,659 --> 02:00:43,699
It's like well could you be a better person in the upcoming year well?

1588
02:00:48,719 --> 02:00:51,589
you can imagine the flood and

1589
02:00:52,619 --> 02:00:55,069
then you can set yourself straight and

1590
02:00:55,860 --> 02:00:59,539
Then you can prepare for it and that means maybe you can stave it off

1591
02:00:59,539 --> 02:01:04,399
But it also means that maybe even if you don't stave it off, you could write it out

1592
02:01:04,769 --> 02:01:10,459
And that's actually the story of noah because what happens with Noah is that he can see that

1593
02:01:11,280 --> 02:01:14,749
things are not good and that there's a flood coming and

1594
02:01:15,510 --> 02:01:20,869
God is maybe letting him know and it says in the story that noah walked with God remember

1595
02:01:20,869 --> 02:01:24,439
And that's what Adam did before he got all self-conscious about the whole thing he walked with God

1596
02:01:24,599 --> 02:01:29,869
We'll talk about that more next time, but what that would mean. Maybe is because Noah was straight

1597
02:01:30,360 --> 02:01:37,579
and he put himself together and his familial relationships were good because it also says that that his antennae were working and

1598
02:01:37,889 --> 02:01:43,129
he could see a little farther into the future than someone whose vision was completely obscured by

1599
02:01:43,289 --> 02:01:46,969
by fog and Chaos and he could tell that

1600
02:01:47,429 --> 02:01:54,109
Things were not going to go well and so he prepared for it and because he prepared for it

1601
02:01:55,380 --> 02:02:02,359
well, then things actually went pretty well for noah even though the flood came, and so that's an interesting thing because that's a that's an

1602
02:02:02,909 --> 02:02:05,748
indeterminant issue in human existence

1603
02:02:06,690 --> 02:02:10,409
How big a hurricane would it take to wipe out new Orleans everyone was prepared?

1604
02:02:11,380 --> 02:02:15,150
Well the you're not going to wipe out the dutch. I mean that's going to be a tough one man

1605
02:02:15,150 --> 02:02:18,659
You're going to have to conjure up a pretty damn big storm to take out their dikes

1606
02:02:19,449 --> 02:02:21,449
well, how

1607
02:02:21,730 --> 02:02:28,829
Thoroughly defended to new Orleans be if nobody in the municipal museum and state governments was corrupt

1608
02:02:30,190 --> 02:02:35,819
Well end of the hurricane probably because that's something that we could clearly deal with we know how to do it and the same

1609
02:02:35,889 --> 02:02:39,419
Applies in your own life is that there are floods coming?

1610
02:02:39,420 --> 02:02:42,599
You can bloody well be sure of that that's absolutely 100%

1611
02:02:43,030 --> 02:02:45,960
Certain some of them are going to be personal some of them are going to be

1612
02:02:46,150 --> 02:02:49,500
Familial some of they're going to be social and political and economic

1613
02:02:49,690 --> 02:02:56,009
It's like are they going to be catastrophes for you, or are you going to ride them out? Are you going to prepare?

1614
02:02:56,260 --> 02:03:00,449
Well the first issue might be well. Do you have your act together well enough to see them coming?

1615
02:03:01,270 --> 02:03:05,849
With enough advance warning so that you can take proper measures. Maybe just decide step it

1616
02:03:05,849 --> 02:03:09,359
Maybe just don't go where the flood is going to be that's a simple thing

1617
02:03:09,360 --> 02:03:14,069
But maybe you don't have that luxury right and so it is going to be a catastrophe

1618
02:03:14,530 --> 02:03:18,000
Maybe someone in your family is going to get really really sick, right?

1619
02:03:18,909 --> 02:03:24,839
And maybe maybe there's just a tiny pathway through that that everything doesn't fall apart

1620
02:03:25,150 --> 02:03:27,929
It doesn't end in divorce. It doesn't end in death

1621
02:03:27,929 --> 02:03:34,348
it doesn't end in Sorrow doesn't end in catastrophe, but the Margin of error is like streaming down to virtually zero and

1622
02:03:35,170 --> 02:03:41,219
Every imperfection that you bring to that situation is going to increase the probability that that tragedy is going to turn into something

1623
02:03:41,650 --> 02:03:45,359
Indistinguishable from hell, and that's coming. It's coming your way

1624
02:03:46,570 --> 02:03:50,369
Absolutely certainly and so then you might think well since it's coming your way

1625
02:03:50,650 --> 02:03:57,629
Maybe the best thing to do is to put yourself together, so that when it comes it can be the least amount of awful possible.

1626
02:03:57,909 --> 02:04:01,199
So I'll close with a story. This was a very

1627
02:04:02,199 --> 02:04:04,199
affecting story for me.

1628
02:04:04,239 --> 02:04:05,800
My

1629
02:04:05,800 --> 02:04:07,239
mother-in-law

1630
02:04:07,239 --> 02:04:13,408
had frontal temporal dementia, and she developed it quite young, she was about 55, something like that, and

1631
02:04:13,989 --> 02:04:16,348
her husband, who was a very extroverted,

1632
02:04:17,020 --> 02:04:22,110
man-about-town guy - I grew up in a small town, everybody knew him - he was charismatic,

1633
02:04:22,930 --> 02:04:24,520
drank too much,

1634
02:04:24,520 --> 02:04:26,729
charismatic, good businessman,

1635
02:04:27,820 --> 02:04:30,029
quite a remarkable person, a real character,

1636
02:04:31,060 --> 02:04:33,660
but not exactly a family man, even though he

1637
02:04:35,350 --> 02:04:37,300
provided for his family very well.

1638
02:04:37,300 --> 02:04:40,500
But when his wife got sick, he really took care of her, man.

1639
02:04:40,600 --> 02:04:47,280
It was something to see, because that's no joke, dealing with someone who has Alzheimer's, for all intents and purposes,

1640
02:04:47,710 --> 02:04:54,449
because they get taken away from you piece by piece, and that is not pretty, and then it's also hard, right.

1641
02:04:54,450 --> 02:04:59,159
Not only is it catastrophic, but it's hard. And Jesus - he just stepped into that, like,

1642
02:05:00,280 --> 02:05:02,280
perfectly, and it was

1643
02:05:03,460 --> 02:05:10,079
way less awful than it could have been, way le- it was just a tragedy. It wasn't hell.

1644
02:05:10,750 --> 02:05:13,079
And then, I was there when she died,

1645
02:05:13,900 --> 02:05:16,889
and my wife's family are

1646
02:05:17,410 --> 02:05:20,010
actually pretty good at dealing with death, as it turns out.

1647
02:05:20,050 --> 02:05:25,980
My wife's sister is a palliative care nurse, and you have to be pretty tough cookie to be a palliative care nurse,

1648
02:05:25,980 --> 02:05:29,759
but you can do it, which is pretty interesting, because that means that you can go make

1649
02:05:30,010 --> 02:05:36,420
relationships with people at the last stages of their life that are genuine relationships, and people just die on you non-stop,

1650
02:05:36,790 --> 02:05:38,790
and yet, you know,

1651
02:05:39,460 --> 02:05:41,460
she's a

1652
02:05:42,550 --> 02:05:44,230
competent,

1653
02:05:44,230 --> 02:05:47,069
alive, alert, fun person, it's like,

1654
02:05:47,620 --> 02:05:52,740
two thumbs up for her, man. That's someone you can rely on in a tragedy. And her other sister

1655
02:05:53,800 --> 02:06:01,290
is a pharmacist, and my wife has volunteered in palliative care wards, and is also very good at taking care of people who are genuinely

1656
02:06:02,050 --> 02:06:04,619
not in good health, and so we were there

1657
02:06:05,620 --> 02:06:07,770
when my mother-in-law died, and

1658
02:06:08,980 --> 02:06:14,279
of course, you could imagine here's a - here's a deathbed situation for you!

1659
02:06:14,890 --> 02:06:18,300
Your mother-in-law is dying and everyone's at each other's throats!

1660
02:06:18,300 --> 02:06:23,040
It's like, you think that's uncommon, then your eyes aren't open, 'cause it's plenty bloody common.

1661
02:06:23,040 --> 02:06:28,109
And then it's not just a tragedy, it's hell. And like, maybe you can stand the tragedy,

1662
02:06:28,110 --> 02:06:32,909
but you can't stand the hell. And in this situation, that isn't what happened.

1663
02:06:33,150 --> 02:06:37,020
Just, everybody pulled together, and what happened was, well, she died.

1664
02:06:37,630 --> 02:06:40,650
But what was so interesting was the family actually came together

1665
02:06:41,350 --> 02:06:43,469
more tightly as a consequence, and so

1666
02:06:43,780 --> 02:06:49,050
although there was something taken away on the one hand, there was something gained on the other that wasn't trivial.

1667
02:06:49,050 --> 02:06:51,810
And I'm not not trying to be all optimistic

1668
02:06:51,810 --> 02:06:58,769
and, you know, "isn't the universe a wonderful place about all this." Like, someone died, in an ugly way, and it was harsh,

1669
02:06:59,199 --> 02:07:03,569
but, God, it was a hell of a lot better than it could have been, and maybe it was good enough!

1670
02:07:03,570 --> 02:07:07,890
That's the thing, you know, is that - this is something that I constantly wonder, is that if

1671
02:07:08,469 --> 02:07:10,979
people did what they could to

1672
02:07:11,980 --> 02:07:13,980
speak the truth and pay attention,

1673
02:07:14,890 --> 02:07:20,039
then maybe the tragedy that's part of life wouldn't have to deteriorate

1674
02:07:20,320 --> 02:07:24,299
into the unbearable hell that doesn't have to be part of life.

1675
02:07:24,300 --> 02:07:29,159
And maybe we could actually tolerate the tragedy, or maybe we could even rise above it, or maybe we could even

1676
02:07:29,350 --> 02:07:35,069
mitigate it, you know, because we can, we do that sort of thing all the time and so it's always an open question.

1677
02:07:35,560 --> 02:07:37,560
And Iliad had put it very well-

1678
02:07:39,070 --> 02:07:45,960
Are the floods the consequence of the fact that things fall apart, or are the floods a consequence of the fact that people

1679
02:07:48,219 --> 02:07:53,698
make mistakes that they know they shouldn't make and make anyways? They sin, right,

1680
02:07:53,699 --> 02:07:58,379
and that's to miss the mark, right, because that's an archery term, to sin, and that means maybe they don't even

1681
02:07:58,510 --> 02:08:05,159
specify the damn target, which is - really, you're not going to hit it unless you specified - or, having specified it,

1682
02:08:05,380 --> 02:08:09,839
they just say, "oh, to hell with it. It's not that important."

1683
02:08:09,840 --> 02:08:13,319
It's like, you got to be careful when you say something like "to hell with it,

1684
02:08:13,390 --> 02:08:18,419
it's not that important," because one of the things that might happen to you if you say "to hell with it,

1685
02:08:18,820 --> 02:08:25,860
it's not that important," is that you might actually end up in hell, for a pretty prolonged period of time, or maybe for the

1686
02:08:26,860 --> 02:08:31,739
remainder of your miserable existence, because it's certainly the case that people do exist there,

1687
02:08:31,780 --> 02:08:35,670
and I've seen them exist there, and once you're there, it's no trick-

1688
02:08:35,670 --> 02:08:37,980
it's no simple matter to get the hell out.

1689
02:08:38,290 --> 02:08:45,689
And so, it might matter that the things that matter get addressed. It might matter that you do what you can to walk with God.

1690
02:08:46,410 --> 02:08:50,369
Like I said, we'll talk more about next time. And it might be that

1691
02:08:51,010 --> 02:08:56,700
that is how you build an ark and are protected from the flood, even if the damn thing comes.

1692
02:08:56,700 --> 02:09:01,679
And the thing is it will. And this is a funny thing, too, that I've noticed about

1693
02:09:02,290 --> 02:09:08,160
our education system, and the way we teach students, and their "trigger warnings", and all of that

1694
02:09:08,830 --> 02:09:14,609
absolute rubbish. I think in most of my lectures, I'd have to have a trigger warning every 15 seconds.

1695
02:09:15,790 --> 02:09:21,540
So, as I tell my students when they're young, it's like, look, don't fool yourself, you know,

1696
02:09:22,780 --> 02:09:25,950
you're going to develop a serious illness, at least one,

1697
02:09:26,200 --> 02:09:29,489
maybe two or three, and one of them is likely to be chronic.

1698
02:09:29,489 --> 02:09:34,049
And if it isn't you, it's going to be someone you love. It's going to be your husband, it's going to be your parent,

1699
02:09:34,050 --> 02:09:39,930
it's going to be your kids. That's coming, and so is a lot of death and s- and pain.

1700
02:09:40,180 --> 02:09:44,309
And so, like, just exactly what sort of person are you going to be when that shows up?

1701
02:09:44,310 --> 02:09:50,700
And that's the right question. It isn't how are you going to be happy in your life? It's like, good luck with that.

1702
02:09:50,910 --> 02:09:55,979
It's a stupid ambition anyways, as far as I'm concerned, because it's too shallow. You know, happiness,

1703
02:09:55,980 --> 02:09:57,060
you're lucky. That comes -

1704
02:09:57,060 --> 02:10:02,850
that comes and goes like the sun coming out from behind a cloud. If you're happy, man, more power to you.

1705
02:10:03,040 --> 02:10:04,469
Enjoy it, enjoy it

1706
02:10:04,469 --> 02:10:10,919
It's a - it's a gift from the cosmos to be happy, but a pursuit? No, no, the pursuit is

1707
02:10:11,350 --> 02:10:13,350
when the damn flood comes,

1708
02:10:13,780 --> 02:10:16,110
you want to be the person who built the ark.

1709
02:10:16,750 --> 02:10:22,560
And that's what the story of Noah is about. And the thing is, the flood is always coming. That's another thing

1710
02:10:22,560 --> 02:10:29,819
that's worth commenting on with regards to this story, is- you know, there's an apocalyptic element to the Judaeo-Christian tradition.

1711
02:10:31,810 --> 02:10:33,520
There's an idea

1712
02:10:33,520 --> 02:10:39,270
that the end of the world is always at hand, and that you should prepare to be judged.

1713
02:10:39,610 --> 02:10:43,140
And the thing about that is, it's true! And the reason it's true is because

1714
02:10:44,020 --> 02:10:51,569
the end of your world is at hand, and it will certainly come, and when it comes, you will be judged,

1715
02:10:52,420 --> 02:10:56,850
because it will be up to you to figure out what to do with the fact that your world just collapsed.

1716
02:10:56,850 --> 02:10:58,949
And that'll be a moral problem of

1717
02:10:59,650 --> 02:11:07,259
ultimate severity, because it will push you right to your limits, and you'll find out exactly where your unaddressed weaknesses lie,

1718
02:11:07,900 --> 02:11:14,940
because that's what happens in a crisis. And so, the reason that that's an archetypal reality, and it lurks underneath the entire

1719
02:11:15,369 --> 02:11:22,949
Judaeo-Christian structure (the apocalypse, the impending apocalypse) is because we always live in apocalyptic times, and your world is always,

1720
02:11:23,080 --> 02:11:25,169
in small ways, and large ways,

1721
02:11:25,719 --> 02:11:26,639
coming to an end.

1722
02:11:26,639 --> 02:11:33,359
And so what do you do? You prepare for it. You prepare for your world to come to an end.

1723
02:11:33,850 --> 02:11:37,559
And then maybe when the end comes, you get another world. That'd be a good deal.

1724
02:11:41,949 --> 02:11:43,949
So, we're ready for this next week.

1725
02:11:55,110 --> 02:12:01,190
My question was regarding the online university you plan to create and the plans you have for that.

1726
02:12:01,350 --> 02:12:05,809
We've spoke briefly last week, and I want to ask you. How can a student such as myself get involved with this process

1727
02:12:10,650 --> 02:12:13,069
Yeah, well an online university. That's a group

1728
02:12:13,920 --> 02:12:20,899
Perhaps a grandiose ambition right but one of the things that so here's my here's my rationale

1729
02:12:22,770 --> 02:12:29,089
you know lots of things have dramatically transformed in the last 20 years and whole swathes of

1730
02:12:31,290 --> 02:12:36,319
Enterprises being wiped out that's happening in a more and more rapid rate as our technology progresses

1731
02:12:36,600 --> 02:12:39,169
Right now newspapers are in the process of dying

1732
02:12:39,170 --> 02:12:45,259
I actually think they're in the process of committing suicide, but they're in the process of dying and

1733
02:12:46,110 --> 02:12:47,719
That's going to happen very rapidly

1734
02:12:47,719 --> 02:12:52,249
I think the globe and mail lost 10% of its readership in the last three months something like that and

1735
02:12:54,690 --> 02:12:56,690
So what happens is that new?

1736
02:12:56,969 --> 02:13:03,739
Technologies come along to supplant the old technologies, and I've watched a number of businesses fail some large businesses I

1737
02:13:04,590 --> 02:13:10,730
Knew some people who worked at digital equipment corporation when it was failing, and I've had some inside track into failing businesses

1738
02:13:10,730 --> 02:13:16,609
and I see when they start to fail they tend to the failure process tends to cap and then accelerate can have an

1739
02:13:16,680 --> 02:13:19,430
Unbelievably good thing and this is what it looks to me

1740
02:13:19,860 --> 02:13:25,819
This is how it looks to me in relationship to the universities, especially in the us although not only

1741
02:13:26,340 --> 02:13:29,719
especially in the humanities although not only so

1742
02:13:31,530 --> 02:13:33,530
number one

1743
02:13:35,280 --> 02:13:37,280
So I

1744
02:13:37,500 --> 02:13:43,699
Recorded three years of my personality lecture say so let's have three years of lectures on freud

1745
02:13:45,300 --> 02:13:47,449
Now what I should do with those I think is

1746
02:13:48,090 --> 02:13:54,230
added them into one really good lecture on freud and then stop giving that lecture because why would I give that lecture again because I've

1747
02:13:54,230 --> 02:13:58,160
Already given it, and it said it events in good shape and if it's a really good lecture

1748
02:13:58,160 --> 02:14:02,749
Then why does someone else have to give the lecture or why does 300 other people have to give a lecture on freud?

1749
02:14:02,910 --> 02:14:03,800
You know what?

1750
02:14:03,800 --> 02:14:04,850
I mean, what's going to happen?

1751
02:14:04,850 --> 02:14:07,660
Is there's going to be some really good extras on subjects?

1752
02:14:07,660 --> 02:14:10,809
And that's all that people are going to need or want

1753
02:14:11,270 --> 02:14:16,120
because the internet tends to move things towards Winner-take-all very very rapidly and

1754
02:14:16,790 --> 02:14:22,600
so it seems to me that we're already at a point technologically where we could identify a

1755
02:14:23,600 --> 02:14:29,140
hundred things that people really need to know and do a sequence of lectures on those things that we're

1756
02:14:29,570 --> 02:14:35,860
Outstanding and then they could be updated and added to but the den it's like it's a done game, and it's free

1757
02:14:36,560 --> 02:14:39,700
so I know it started thinking about this last year when I noticed that my

1758
02:14:40,610 --> 02:14:43,539
Psychology lectures had a million views and that was last april

1759
02:14:43,540 --> 02:14:48,700
And I thought that's amazing a million views it's like what the hell that's I don't know what to make of that

1760
02:14:48,700 --> 02:14:49,990
That's that's the best

1761
02:14:49,990 --> 02:14:54,490
That's the kind of bestselling book that you never write because no one ever writes a best-selling book

1762
02:14:54,800 --> 02:14:57,849
So a million views that's something to pay attention to now

1763
02:14:57,850 --> 02:14:58,970
It's way more than that

1764
02:14:58,970 --> 02:15:04,329
But there's videos and podcasts and that means that people can listen when you're doing other things, too

1765
02:15:04,330 --> 02:15:05,350
And so that's really cool

1766
02:15:05,350 --> 02:15:11,559
And maybe people can listen better than they can read that's a real possibility because we've only been really silent lee for about

1767
02:15:12,050 --> 02:15:18,999
Almost of like most of humanity for less than a hundred years and virtually no one could read silently 500 years ago

1768
02:15:19,130 --> 02:15:21,759
It's a really new skill, and so maybe we're better at listening

1769
02:15:22,670 --> 02:15:29,439
And so all of a sudden is the possibility of disseminating high-quality educational material highly produced

1770
02:15:30,140 --> 02:15:33,519
highly vetted to millions of people

1771
02:15:34,190 --> 02:15:35,930
for nothing

1772
02:15:35,930 --> 02:15:38,320
Well, how are you going to compete with that then?

1773
02:15:39,050 --> 02:15:43,840
Then it's worse because the humanities which have become completely

1774
02:15:44,270 --> 02:15:50,110
Degenerated almost completely degenerate in my estimation have abandoned their valuable intellectual property

1775
02:15:50,450 --> 02:15:58,389
which is the collective wisdom at least for the west of western Civilization's just sitting there someone might as well steal it back and

1776
02:15:58,970 --> 02:16:05,320
Then there's the student loan debacle in the united states that's pronounced properly debacle debate

1777
02:16:06,470 --> 02:16:07,940
debacle okay

1778
02:16:07,940 --> 02:16:14,710
Obviously I've read that word more than said it and so you know and so you know I write me today

1779
02:16:14,710 --> 02:16:19,090
And he asked if you should go to a private college for tWenty-two thousand dollars a year to purdue it pretty

1780
02:16:19,200 --> 02:16:21,200
is to pursue an undergraduate in

1781
02:16:21,550 --> 02:16:28,170
In psychology so that he could get into clinical graduate school or go to another university of State university for far less

1782
02:16:28,170 --> 02:16:31,799
I told them to go to the state university because it's the wise economic decision

1783
02:16:31,800 --> 02:16:36,539
But you know it doesn't seem to me that it's reasonable at all to load people up when they're 22 with

1784
02:16:36,940 --> 02:16:42,930
$100,000 of student debt that they cannot declare bankruptcy for it's indentured servitude and

1785
02:16:43,360 --> 02:16:48,239
The and to load up people when they're 22 or 23 with dead of that magnitude

1786
02:16:48,240 --> 02:16:50,240
It's like how the hell are they going to be?

1787
02:16:50,290 --> 02:16:54,990
Entrepreneurs who are going to take a risk with a hundred thousand dollar debt load and who's going to marry you?

1788
02:16:55,600 --> 02:17:01,559
So really jesus you know because another story. I heard recently was well. I just got married to my partner

1789
02:17:01,560 --> 02:17:06,419
She brought into the marriage one hundred and twenty thousand dollars of student debt. It's like oh my God. It's like

1790
02:17:06,430 --> 02:17:10,829
It's crippling man like once you're once you're making a substantial

1791
02:17:11,080 --> 02:17:13,919
Amount of money if you're fortunate maybe you're in your 40s

1792
02:17:13,920 --> 02:17:16,259
You could handle a dead load like that, but in your 20s

1793
02:17:16,260 --> 02:17:21,000
It's just crippling so you know the tuition fees of ratt

1794
02:17:21,400 --> 02:17:26,249
Ratcheted up like mad in the last 30 years the unity colleges and universities have become unbelievably

1795
02:17:26,830 --> 02:17:33,749
Administrative leeteuk, heavy, they're regulated to death by the by the legislative system. So there's ethics committees

1796
02:17:33,750 --> 02:17:39,240
Which are so counterproductive that it's just unbelievable. There's this entire. Whole whole new Monstrous

1797
02:17:40,300 --> 02:17:46,890
Hyper accommodation movement that it's big borders on I don't eat. Well. I'll make a video about that soon enough

1798
02:17:46,920 --> 02:17:50,400
It's absolutely pathological, and there's this whole postmodern

1799
02:17:50,950 --> 02:17:56,459
Neo-Marxist idiocy that's going on in the universities and so like how many mistakes does an institute plus

1800
02:17:57,280 --> 02:18:03,629
Students aren't being taught how to speak they're not being taught how to debate they're not being taught how to write and they don't read

1801
02:18:03,850 --> 02:18:06,749
Difficult things they read French intellectual

1802
02:18:07,270 --> 02:18:10,409
Postmodernists right and they probably don't read those either they read

1803
02:18:10,990 --> 02:18:15,119
Secondarily derived pit they skim secondarily derived papers

1804
02:18:15,580 --> 02:18:20,129
about French intellectual post Marxist post Modernist from the

1805
02:18:20,500 --> 02:18:26,790
1970s and the standards have been lowered because there's too many people pursuing higher education and so I think okay

1806
02:18:28,630 --> 02:18:30,780
There's eight dimensions of success

1807
02:18:31,540 --> 02:18:36,429
And on every single dimension. There's failure the system's done

1808
02:18:37,309 --> 02:18:42,969
The end so the Vision would be why not provide everybody in the world with high quality

1809
02:18:43,429 --> 02:18:49,268
Education in the humanities for like 150th the cost you can charge for accreditation

1810
02:18:49,700 --> 02:18:56,169
That's a whole separate issue right accreditation, but that what the resources like why not make them available to everyone

1811
02:18:57,319 --> 02:19:00,309
So that's the plan I mean, I don't know if I can do it or not

1812
02:19:00,309 --> 02:19:03,099
But it's partly what I'm doing with this biblical lecture series

1813
02:19:03,099 --> 02:19:05,199
It's sort of putting my toe in the water

1814
02:19:05,660 --> 02:19:07,660
but I have a plan and

1815
02:19:07,700 --> 02:19:12,369
I have some good programmers who are willing to help and there's lots of people out there that would help God and be

1816
02:19:12,529 --> 02:19:14,120
flooded with offers of help

1817
02:19:14,120 --> 02:19:19,479
I'd love to take people up on the offers, but it's not that easy to get someone to help you do something you know it

1818
02:19:20,450 --> 02:19:21,740
so

1819
02:19:21,740 --> 02:19:25,990
That'd be the plan it's like so what would the plan be give people a high quality?

1820
02:19:26,330 --> 02:19:29,319
education in the classic humanities teach them how to speak and write

1821
02:19:30,050 --> 02:19:36,849
Accredit them for one tenth the current cost and do it with millions of people instead of tens of thousands

1822
02:19:37,250 --> 02:19:39,339
Some I'm asking what plans Jeff for the accreditation

1823
02:19:39,500 --> 02:19:44,859
Side where people can show something for what's the time these don't watch well one of the things that I would do for example is

1824
02:19:45,200 --> 02:19:47,200
imagine that you are in a course and

1825
02:19:47,389 --> 02:19:53,679
So you have taken exam? Let's say it's a multiple-choice exam. Just for the sake of argument because they're simpler

1826
02:19:54,319 --> 02:19:56,319
The writing issue is a separate problem

1827
02:19:56,960 --> 02:19:58,880
well, so

1828
02:19:58,880 --> 02:20:03,549
One of the things that you would do if you enrolled in the course is generate multiple-choice questions

1829
02:20:03,550 --> 02:20:05,120
That would be one of your assignments

1830
02:20:05,120 --> 02:20:11,169
Here's a lecture generate 10 multiple-choice questions now you go to thousand people generating 10 multiple-choice questions

1831
02:20:11,210 --> 02:20:15,849
Well, then you can do there are statistical procedures that help you figure out, what valid

1832
02:20:16,490 --> 02:20:18,050
multiple choice

1833
02:20:18,050 --> 02:20:21,759
Questions are could have people vote on them for that matter if you put them on a website

1834
02:20:22,279 --> 02:20:26,829
Assignment number two here's a hundred multiple choice questions pick the ten that you think are most

1835
02:20:27,830 --> 02:20:32,529
representative of the knowledge that you've acquired get a hundred people to do that so you get

1836
02:20:32,810 --> 02:20:34,660
crowdsource the test construction

1837
02:20:34,660 --> 02:20:39,459
And then you can keep making the test better and better as well because you could build that I'd like to build the system

1838
02:20:39,460 --> 02:20:44,830
So that it was self improving with a minimum of administrative interference and so

1839
02:20:45,580 --> 02:20:48,549
Then what would happen is that as you got accredited?

1840
02:20:48,550 --> 02:20:54,310
So you start writing exams and maybe write more and more of them then you'd start to by voting power with regards to the content?

1841
02:20:54,311 --> 02:21:00,160
Of the courses and maybe even the right to produce courses to put them up online so it's something like that

1842
02:21:00,160 --> 02:21:02,160
but our strategy would be to build

1843
02:21:02,600 --> 02:21:08,230
We want to build a system. That's basically autonomous and self-improving right from the beginning, so

1844
02:21:09,021 --> 02:21:12,130
minimum of administrative overhead extremely low cost

1845
02:21:13,160 --> 02:21:15,160
Widespread availability

1846
02:21:15,740 --> 02:21:21,730
Crowd-sourced in its structure and an autonomously self-improving. I think we can do that

1847
02:21:21,730 --> 02:21:27,909
I don't know if I can do it but I think we have the technology to do that and then you think well

1848
02:21:28,521 --> 02:21:32,200
So here's the plan you know because you're are. I'm always thinking of the point point B

1849
02:21:32,200 --> 02:21:36,639
What what's a good thing to do with life? Well, the good good thing to do with your life is the most difficult

1850
02:21:36,640 --> 02:21:41,440
God damn you thing you can think of that would do the most possible good that'll get you up in the morning

1851
02:21:41,720 --> 02:21:44,889
And so because you think why should I get up in the morning?

1852
02:21:44,890 --> 02:21:49,690
It's like well, you know I've got 50 million people to educate. Hey that'll do it

1853
02:21:50,960 --> 02:21:56,560
Really you know that's that battle that will overcome a lot of eggs. That's sort of thinking so

1854
02:21:57,320 --> 02:22:02,020
Well, so it seems to me that it seems to me that it's inevitable

1855
02:22:02,660 --> 02:22:03,710
now

1856
02:22:03,710 --> 02:22:05,710
Whether or not I can do it

1857
02:22:05,840 --> 02:22:07,010
That's a whole different story

1858
02:22:07,010 --> 02:22:12,520
But I can certainly start it and I'm going to start it my partner my business partner the guy who helped me

1859
02:22:13,550 --> 02:22:17,770
develop the self authoring program which thousands of people are using that now and

1860
02:22:18,230 --> 02:22:25,419
We've helped thousands of thousands of students now stay in the university, so that's really cool. Well, maybe not given the state of the university

1861
02:22:26,990 --> 02:22:30,490
I'm contributing to the problem, but you know, but they're

1862
02:22:31,010 --> 02:22:36,340
But they're sticking out their plans. That's the point. They're actually making plans and sticking them out, so

1863
02:22:37,370 --> 02:22:42,759
So I think that we can and we know how to start small with because the way to build a big system is to build

1864
02:22:42,760 --> 02:22:45,730
a small system that works and then scale it and so

1865
02:22:46,370 --> 02:22:48,999
That's I've been talking with my partner

1866
02:22:49,000 --> 02:22:54,490
His name is Daniel higgins another partner Bob peel he used to be my graduate supervisor at McGill

1867
02:22:54,490 --> 02:22:59,658
And we've been working on this sort of thing for about 25 years and our goal being right from the beginning to build

1868
02:23:00,449 --> 02:23:01,979
Low-cost high-quality

1869
02:23:01,979 --> 02:23:03,060
psycho-educational

1870
02:23:03,060 --> 02:23:06,619
interventions and bring them to as wide a market as possible, so

1871
02:23:07,020 --> 02:23:12,800
and then my and Daniel in particular has devoted most of his life to doing that it's been about 20 years now, so

1872
02:23:14,520 --> 02:23:18,949
So well that's a sketch of it all outline more of it on the web at some point

1873
02:23:18,949 --> 02:23:22,158
But that's kind of what's what we've been deciding. What we've been planning to do

1874
02:23:23,069 --> 02:23:25,069
Yep

1875
02:23:27,720 --> 02:23:29,609
look

1876
02:23:29,609 --> 02:23:36,799
When you were on the rubin report not too long ago in that discussion you mentioned how use of psilocybin

1877
02:23:37,560 --> 02:23:39,510
straightens people out and

1878
02:23:39,510 --> 02:23:41,510
Can produce these transcendent?

1879
02:23:41,939 --> 02:23:44,238
Experiences, which is jarring for a person who may have?

1880
02:23:44,819 --> 02:23:51,439
Personally wanted lesion that on the rubin which were happy with for someone who became a Christian as a result of their only time doing

1881
02:23:51,439 --> 02:23:53,749
Magic mushrooms was during piece of information

1882
02:23:53,750 --> 02:23:58,009
I was just wondering if you could expand on what you find intriguing about religious experience

1883
02:23:58,010 --> 02:24:01,010
And what we can know about the transcendent from them if anything

1884
02:24:06,539 --> 02:24:08,539
That's a tough one, man um

1885
02:24:14,000 --> 02:24:16,000
the relationship between

1886
02:24:16,370 --> 02:24:22,599
entheogen accuse let's say which is sometimes what those chemicals are described and

1887
02:24:23,240 --> 02:24:25,240
Religious experience is unspecified

1888
02:24:25,640 --> 02:24:29,890
But it looks like it's profound there was a man named Gordon was saw

1889
02:24:30,440 --> 02:24:33,249
Who wrote a book I remember correctly called Soma?

1890
02:24:33,979 --> 02:24:39,309
He was investigating the potential use of hema, Nida Muscaria mushrooms

1891
02:24:39,830 --> 02:24:42,999
Among the people who wrote the hindu, holy scriptures

1892
02:24:43,850 --> 02:24:50,500
Thousands of Years ago, and he felt that he identified the chemical that they were using the sacred drink

1893
02:24:51,680 --> 02:24:53,979
the use of Ayahuasca and

1894
02:24:55,520 --> 02:25:00,729
psilocybin mushrooms and so forth is well-documented particularly in North America and the

1895
02:25:00,950 --> 02:25:07,749
Evidence the empirical evidence that under certain conditions those chemicals can produce religious experiences is absolutely overwhelming

1896
02:25:08,270 --> 02:25:10,930
That has been good research done recently at Johns Hopkins

1897
02:25:12,290 --> 02:25:16,540
Looking at psilocybin the first research that's been done on hallucinogens really in

1898
02:25:17,840 --> 02:25:22,450
30 years because people were so terrified of them in the 60s and for good reason

1899
02:25:24,620 --> 02:25:32,320
indicated that the people that they dosed with psilocybin about 75 percent of them had a mystical experience which they regarded as one of the

1900
02:25:33,080 --> 02:25:37,509
Five three to five most important experiences of their life and a year later

1901
02:25:38,690 --> 02:25:44,529
Were characterized by a permanent personality transformation which was an increase in trade openness of one standard deviation?

1902
02:25:45,050 --> 02:25:50,380
Which is a lot by the way it moves you from 50th percentile to 85th percentile for example

1903
02:25:50,380 --> 02:25:54,759
It's a huge move and that looked permanent now whether or not that's a good thing

1904
02:25:54,760 --> 02:25:59,440
That's a whole different issue, but they're very very powerful and they also did some recent research

1905
02:26:00,260 --> 02:26:04,719
Showing that psilocybin mushrooms were an unbelievably effective smoking cessation

1906
02:26:06,410 --> 02:26:13,269
Intervention so if I remember correctly and I may have this wrong because it's been awhile since I read it an 80% success rate in

1907
02:26:14,420 --> 02:26:16,420
stopping people from using

1908
02:26:16,580 --> 02:26:20,259
Tobacco with one psilocybin experience and so

1909
02:26:20,780 --> 02:26:26,190
Well, so those things are very all of that's very interesting to me, and I don't exactly know what make of it

1910
02:26:26,190 --> 02:26:30,029
I don't know what to make of it at all not even a little bit but

1911
02:26:32,591 --> 02:26:35,280
but the evidence for the relationship between

1912
02:26:36,040 --> 02:26:38,310
met mystical experiences and

1913
02:26:39,251 --> 02:26:46,560
Hallucinogen use of certain types is incontrovertible, and I don't and I don't think anybody else knows what to derive from that

1914
02:26:46,561 --> 02:26:48,561
I mean one conclusion is

1915
02:26:49,271 --> 02:26:51,271
something like

1916
02:26:53,080 --> 02:26:58,200
Religious experiences are a common concomitant of going temporarily insane

1917
02:26:58,561 --> 02:27:03,150
and that it's not a bad hypothesis because you see for example in the prodrome of

1918
02:27:03,700 --> 02:27:04,961
illnesses like schizophrenia

1919
02:27:04,961 --> 02:27:10,320
And sometimes manic depressive disorder - on a Mannequin you do see the emergence

1920
02:27:10,690 --> 02:27:17,159
Often of religious type delusions. It's not that common, but it's not uncommon so it's definitely the case that if your

1921
02:27:18,280 --> 02:27:19,480
Brain

1922
02:27:19,480 --> 02:27:24,390
function has been detrimental e affected one of the consequences can be

1923
02:27:25,330 --> 02:27:32,610
Experiences that are subjectively experienced as indistinguishable from the religious you also see the same thing in cases of epilepsy

1924
02:27:33,160 --> 02:27:34,711
especially in the prodromus

1925
02:27:34,711 --> 02:27:41,490
So if you have an epileptic condition sometimes you know that you're going to have a seizure you can feel it mounting and often

1926
02:27:42,580 --> 02:27:44,471
Or at least occasionally

1927
02:27:44,471 --> 02:27:48,841
those experiences are associated with an elevation of

1928
02:27:49,721 --> 02:27:52,200
religious sensation deepening meaning

1929
02:27:52,990 --> 02:27:57,060
that increases in its depth and complexity until it's

1930
02:27:57,761 --> 02:27:59,761
Overwhelming and that's what?

1931
02:28:00,160 --> 02:28:02,160
Subjectively brings on the seizure now

1932
02:28:02,801 --> 02:28:09,150
God only knows how to disentangle causality in this circumstance like that dostoevsky had seizures like that by the way

1933
02:28:09,461 --> 02:28:13,440
So so that the the pessimistic Viewpoint is

1934
02:28:15,431 --> 02:28:18,570
Religious phenomenology is a consequence of brain disorder

1935
02:28:19,601 --> 02:28:21,601
the positive side

1936
02:28:22,091 --> 02:28:24,091
more positive side is

1937
02:28:24,940 --> 02:28:27,359
no, religious experience is a

1938
02:28:28,511 --> 02:28:34,530
category of experience that's within the realm of human possibility and there are different modes of

1939
02:28:34,841 --> 02:28:39,450
Eliciting it and we know that there are many modes of eliciting. It's stinkin elicited

1940
02:28:44,230 --> 02:28:48,509
dancing under some circumstances music and elicited music elicits it regularly

1941
02:28:48,510 --> 02:28:53,490
I mean basically as far as I'm concerned Rock concerts are indistinguishable from religious rituals

1942
02:28:54,160 --> 02:28:56,579
their rituals not like they don't come with

1943
02:28:57,400 --> 02:29:02,730
Dogmatic overlay, let's say, but the ritualistic structure is there and maybe it's there just listening to music

1944
02:29:04,870 --> 02:29:11,310
What that means for the investigation of hallucinogens? I have no idea and I would also certainly

1945
02:29:12,070 --> 02:29:16,560
Use the caution that carl jung developed when he was talking about hallucinogens

1946
02:29:16,561 --> 02:29:19,590
And he did that I think only a very brief number of times

1947
02:29:19,590 --> 02:29:25,440
And I think in relationship to aldous huxley's original work on mescaline experiences. He said

1948
02:29:26,320 --> 02:29:28,919
Beware of wisdom that you didn't earn

1949
02:29:30,101 --> 02:29:33,570
And that's very very smart, so I would say

1950
02:29:34,240 --> 02:29:36,240
there's something to be learned about

1951
02:29:36,370 --> 02:29:37,660
There's something

1952
02:29:37,660 --> 02:29:43,350
There's a lot to be learned about hallucinogens there may be something to be learned from them, but having said that

1953
02:29:44,470 --> 02:29:49,470
if you play with fire you end up burnt generally speaking, so

1954
02:29:50,830 --> 02:29:56,459
All due caution is in effect. So one more

1955
02:29:57,790 --> 02:30:01,169
I know you're now the flex lee fan, so I thought I'd ask you this question

1956
02:30:02,440 --> 02:30:10,350
After reading his book doors of perception in which he gives an account of his experience taking the pSyChedelic drug mescaline

1957
02:30:11,170 --> 02:30:14,940
He stated that in the final stages of egolessness

1958
02:30:14,980 --> 02:30:22,799
there is an obscene knowledge that all isn't all that all was actually each he then went out to say that this is as

1959
02:30:23,140 --> 02:30:26,670
Near I take it as a finite mind can ever get to perceiving

1960
02:30:27,190 --> 02:30:29,190
Everything that is happening in the universe

1961
02:30:29,440 --> 02:30:35,190
I was wondering if maybe you could explain what that means because I've been trying to understand it for a monster

1962
02:30:42,750 --> 02:30:47,600
There's the neuroscientist a while back his name. I don't remember who had a stroke and she

1963
02:30:49,561 --> 02:30:52,131
being a neuroscientist was analyzing the

1964
02:30:53,311 --> 02:30:58,881
Neurological consequences of the stroke as it occurred if I remember correctly the stroke

1965
02:30:59,790 --> 02:31:05,180
Either temporarily or more permanently took out the function of large portions of her left

1966
02:31:05,610 --> 02:31:06,110
hemisphere

1967
02:31:06,110 --> 02:31:09,199
And she had exactly that experience

1968
02:31:09,421 --> 02:31:16,460
it was an experience of ego dissolution something like that that the the felt sense of

1969
02:31:18,690 --> 02:31:22,670
Identity shifting from that sort of Narrow Boundaries, maybe that you would define

1970
02:31:23,370 --> 02:31:28,340
By the boundary of your physical being into something that was much broader and much

1971
02:31:29,580 --> 02:31:34,220
Like it gets it gets it gets hard to describe this without you know

1972
02:31:34,980 --> 02:31:40,310
degenerating into hippy poetry from 1967 very very rapidly, but it's something like

1973
02:31:41,311 --> 02:31:42,631
A

1974
02:31:42,631 --> 02:31:49,850
Sense a sense of of the underlying unity of consciousness that might be one way of thinking about we don't know much about consciousness

1975
02:31:50,101 --> 02:31:57,261
In fact, I don't think we know anything about consciousness and obviously consciousness is something that we all Share, but it's also something that we

1976
02:31:58,021 --> 02:32:00,141
seem to also experience individually

1977
02:32:00,360 --> 02:32:05,569
But maybe our individual consciousnesses are something like the manifestations of something

1978
02:32:05,570 --> 02:32:13,100
That's a more unified consciousness underneath. I mean that's hardly an original idea, but it does seem to be the case that under some circumstances

1979
02:32:14,131 --> 02:32:17,210
There are neurological transformations that make that

1980
02:32:18,811 --> 02:32:22,070
Link more apparent assuming that the link exists now

1981
02:32:22,070 --> 02:32:29,270
You could say well. No, they're just producing a delusion, but the funny thing about you know funny thing about delusions

1982
02:32:29,271 --> 02:32:30,561
Is that you've got to think well?

1983
02:32:30,561 --> 02:32:32,431
how do you know something's a delusion and

1984
02:32:32,431 --> 02:32:38,330
The answer that has to be like something like well hardly anyone else thinks that that would be criterion number one

1985
02:32:38,370 --> 02:32:44,300
But criterion number two would be if you act on the delusion does your ship sink

1986
02:32:44,940 --> 02:32:52,488
Because if your sip sinks, then it was a delusion, it's some like that, but if you act on your delusion and things get better

1987
02:32:53,399 --> 02:32:54,420
well

1988
02:32:54,420 --> 02:32:56,270
Then maybe it wasn't a delusion

1989
02:32:56,270 --> 02:33:01,550
And there's no evidence from the psilocybin studies that have been conducted at johns hopkins that there was detrimental

1990
02:33:01,830 --> 02:33:06,319
Effects for the participants and the participants certainly don't think the day effects are detrimental

1991
02:33:07,140 --> 02:33:12,830
So and I've been hesitant to talk about any of this for obvious reasons haha. I'll tell you something really funny

1992
02:33:12,920 --> 02:33:17,449
I think it's funny anyways I had timothy leary's old job at Harvard

1993
02:33:18,390 --> 02:33:24,920
So you know and so leary is a good object lesson and being very careful about this sort of thing because it certainly

1994
02:33:28,739 --> 02:33:31,519
It isn't obvious that his net effect was good

1995
02:33:32,970 --> 02:33:37,010
And I say that with some caution because leary was a very smart person and he was very creative

1996
02:33:37,500 --> 02:33:44,149
but he got tangled up in that hallucinogenic Madhouse you know that that characterized the say the period from

1997
02:33:44,550 --> 02:33:50,179
1965 to about 1970 and it didn't seem to me that that was altogether a good thing

1998
02:33:50,489 --> 02:33:53,359
thing is we have these chemicals now in our culture and

1999
02:33:53,790 --> 02:34:00,439
people are experimenting with them like mad and making them illegal doesn't seem to be working in large part because

2000
02:34:01,319 --> 02:34:03,979
There I think there were seven known

2001
02:34:04,560 --> 02:34:08,870
Seven to Twenty known psychoactive substances that were illegal in

2002
02:34:09,330 --> 02:34:12,620
The year 2000 there's something like 400 now

2003
02:34:13,199 --> 02:34:16,158
Because labs all over the world keep tweaking the molecules

2004
02:34:16,560 --> 02:34:23,359
right because molecule a is illegal so chemists just shifted a little bit and they have a new hallucinogen and

2005
02:34:24,390 --> 02:34:29,510
Which might be fine and might not be because now and then you can produce a chemical that's unbelievably dangerous

2006
02:34:30,060 --> 02:34:35,210
Fentanyl sort of like that there was a drug a while back that I could name. I can't remember the name

2007
02:34:35,520 --> 02:34:40,909
It was an acronym. It was a fun drug if you took it once it gave you permanent irreversible

2008
02:34:41,520 --> 02:34:48,739
Total Parkinson's disease so people would take it and they were frozen and that was it so mpTp

2009
02:34:48,739 --> 02:34:50,250
I think it was called

2010
02:34:50,250 --> 02:34:53,120
So because it destroyed the same area of the brain that

2011
02:34:53,760 --> 02:34:56,599
that Parkinson's destroys accepted in it right away, so

2012
02:34:57,689 --> 02:35:00,139
You know designer drugs, right?

2013
02:35:00,870 --> 02:35:02,050
A

2014
02:35:02,050 --> 02:35:03,820
Little Caution is in order

2015
02:35:03,820 --> 02:35:09,089
How we might approach the issue of hallucinogen use in a mature Manner

2016
02:35:09,400 --> 02:35:12,359
Well, that's a topic for an entirely other discussion

2017
02:35:12,390 --> 02:35:17,640
I'm not even necessarily sure that it can be approached that way although I would say at minimum

2018
02:35:21,010 --> 02:35:27,120
determining what it is that you're up to if you're going to experiment would be a good thing like what is it exactly that you're

2019
02:35:27,120 --> 02:35:30,990
Serving they're not party drugs and not for fun

2020
02:35:31,601 --> 02:35:37,590
Right whatever. They are that's not what they're for and so, maybe they could be used

2021
02:35:38,290 --> 02:35:44,490
By people who are carefully orienting themselves towards the good although I wouldn't say that that should be

2022
02:35:44,980 --> 02:35:46,980
Read as a recommendation

2023
02:35:47,980 --> 02:35:49,980
Thank you. Yep

2024
02:35:53,830 --> 02:35:56,400
The theory next week, thank you
