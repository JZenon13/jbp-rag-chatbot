[Music]

2
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:40,829
thank you thank you so I've been

3
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:43,230
thinking about things that I'm happy

4
00:00:40,829 --> 00:00:45,750
about and what I'm most happy about so

5
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:48,120
far is that I haven't spilled my my

6
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,410
bubbly water into my computer so far

7
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:51,000
while I've been doing these lectures

8
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:52,320
that's always I'll probably do it

9
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,589
tonight now that I'm bragging about

10
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:58,199
having avoided it so thank you all for

11
00:00:55,589 --> 00:01:01,530
coming this is the last lecture in this

12
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:03,000
12 part series I did mention that I have

13
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:04,739
made arrangements with the theatre at

14
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,270
least to do this once a month for the

15
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:07,860
next four months and we'll see we'll

16
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:09,479
play it by ear past end I want to

17
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:11,340
continue and I'll find another venue and

18
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:13,530
perhaps to do it every two weeks but

19
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,119
certainly once a month and maybe I can

20
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:16,619
even get deeper into the material if

21
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,750
it's only once a month so that would be

22
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:22,530
then and then we'll really slow down to

23
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:24,690
a snail's crawl yeah so this is a tough

24
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:26,250
one tonight you know it's something a

25
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:27,990
story that everyone with any sense

26
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,479
should approach with a substantial

27
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:34,710
degree of trepidation I've been working

28
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:36,600
on my book this week on Chapter 7 which

29
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:39,630
is called do what is meaningful not

30
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,190
what's expedient and it's really it's

31
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:46,590
been a very difficult chapter because

32
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:48,599
I'm coming to I'm trying to to extend my

33
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:49,530
understanding of sacrifice which is of

34
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:54,119
course what we're going to talk about

35
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:55,619
tonight in great detail and and I've

36
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:57,000
been wrestling with exactly how to do

37
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:59,459
that and I'm going to read you some of

38
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,899
that I think today don't generally read

39
00:01:59,459 --> 00:02:03,660
when I do my lectures but this is so

40
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:05,489
complicated that I'm not confident of my

41
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:08,119
ability to just spin it off you know

42
00:02:05,489 --> 00:02:12,630
sort of what would you call it

43
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:14,280
spontaneously that's the word and so and

44
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:15,750
it'll also give me a chance to test out

45
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:17,700
whether what I've written which I've

46
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:19,709
been struggling with has the kind of

47
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:20,970
poetic flow that I'd like to have if

48
00:02:19,709 --> 00:02:22,470
you're writing it's really good to read

49
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:24,120
things aloud you know because you can

50
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:27,989
tell if you've got the rhythmic cadence

51
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:30,330
right then so so anyways thank you all

52
00:02:27,989 --> 00:02:32,550
for coming many of you have I believe

53
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:35,069
attended all 12 lectures and that's

54
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:36,810
really remarkable it's amazing that you

55
00:02:35,069 --> 00:02:38,700
know this place has been full every

56
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:40,290
single lecture it's completely

57
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,269
unbelievable that would be the case and

58
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:44,730
you know about more than two million

59
00:02:42,269 --> 00:02:46,680
views of this is being watched more than

60
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:47,850
two million views it's not 2 million

61
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,190
people because it would be the same

62
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:52,890
people I would suspect many times but

63
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:54,960
that's also crazy but it's a crazy world

64
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:57,480
and it seems to keep me getting crazier

65
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:59,400
so hopefully this is some addition to

66
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:03,920
stabilizing it and making it slightly

67
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:06,240
more sane that's the hope anyways so

68
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:11,580
we've got a couple of stories to deal

69
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:13,350
with tonight complex complex stories not

70
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:15,750
really easy to comprehend in any sense

71
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:19,050
of the in sense of the word I mean with

72
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:22,140
the story of Isaac God calls on his his

73
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:23,540
chosen individual Abraham the person

74
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:26,490
who's made this contract with to

75
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:27,720
sacrifice his son and it's how in the

76
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:30,090
world are you supposed to make sensible

77
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,830
any sort of sensible sense out of that

78
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:35,040
it's exactly that sort of story that

79
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:37,020
makes modern people who are convinced

80
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,760
that the faster we put the biblical

81
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:40,470
stories behind us the better it's it's

82
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,050
grist for their mill you know because it

83
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:45,510
seems like such a incomprehensible and

84
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:48,690
even barbaric act on the part of God and

85
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:52,560
so you know I hesitate to even approach

86
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:54,720
it because well because there's so many

87
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,280
ways that the an interpretation of that

88
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,560
sort can go wrong but we'll see how it

89
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,780
goes and so let's walk through it and

90
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:04,260
see what happens so we start with the

91
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:06,690
story of Sarah and Isaac and the Lord

92
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:09,600
visited Sarah as he had said you

93
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:12,120
remember when Abraham was in the midst

94
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:14,250
of his appropriate sacrificial routines

95
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:16,950
which we've characterized as his return

96
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:19,470
to the contract he made with the idea of

97
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:21,840
the good the contract with God he was

98
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:24,300
informed by God that he would get what

99
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,130
he most wanted which was an error and it

100
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:28,260
despite his advanced old age and of

101
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:30,030
course Sarah was very skeptical about

102
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:32,730
that as she had every reason to be but

103
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:35,490
this story opens with with the

104
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:37,230
fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham

105
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:40,080
and the Lord visited Sarah as he had

106
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:42,720
said and the Lord did unto Sarah as he

107
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,480
had spoken for Sarah conceived and bore

108
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:48,000
Abraham a son in his old age at the set

109
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:50,550
time of which God had spoken to him and

110
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,950
Abraham called the name of his son that

111
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:55,800
was born unto Him whom Sarah bear to him

112
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:58,020
Isaac and Abraham circumcised his son

113
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,919
Isaac being eight days old as God

114
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:01,930
commanded him had commanded him

115
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:04,900
and Abraham was a hundred years old when

116
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:08,469
his son Isaac was born unto him and

117
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:11,199
Sarah said goth had made God had God

118
00:05:08,469 --> 00:05:13,779
have made me to laugh so that all that

119
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,240
here will laugh with me and she said who

120
00:05:13,779 --> 00:05:17,710
would have said unto Abraham that Sarah

121
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:20,169
should have given children suck for I've

122
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:21,460
borne him a son in his old age and the

123
00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:23,620
child grew and was weaned and Abraham

124
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:26,400
made a great feast the same day that

125
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:29,590
Isaac was weaned I suppose one of the

126
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,479
one of the purposes let's say perhaps

127
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:37,419
the literary purposes of this story is

128
00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:41,080
to exaggerate for dramatic purposes the

129
00:05:37,419 --> 00:05:43,029
importance of a child you know when

130
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,759
people are young and I think this is

131
00:05:43,029 --> 00:05:49,740
particularly true in the modern world

132
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:52,150
they seem to often regard the

133
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:54,039
possibility of having a child as an

134
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:56,680
impediment to their lifestyle you know

135
00:05:54,039 --> 00:05:59,199
and of course in some ways I suppose

136
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:01,479
that's true although you have to have

137
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,889
quite a lifestyle before a child

138
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:05,199
actually constitutes an impediment

139
00:06:02,889 --> 00:06:07,389
because having a child in your life is

140
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,250
actually something that's remarkable

141
00:06:07,389 --> 00:06:11,199
almost beyond belief you know you can

142
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:12,789
have a relationship with a child that is

143
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,889
better than any relationship you've ever

144
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:17,009
had with anyone in your life if you're

145
00:06:14,889 --> 00:06:20,710
careful and if you're fortunate

146
00:06:17,009 --> 00:06:23,050
fortunate being fortunate helps you know

147
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:25,089
I've seen many people delay having

148
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:27,159
children and for understandable reasons

149
00:06:25,089 --> 00:06:28,569
it's no simple decision to have a child

150
00:06:27,159 --> 00:06:30,039
and of course now we can make the

151
00:06:28,569 --> 00:06:32,469
decision to have a child which of course

152
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:34,899
people couldn't in in past ages really

153
00:06:32,469 --> 00:06:36,129
but sometimes you see people delay and

154
00:06:34,899 --> 00:06:37,569
they delay too long and then they don't

155
00:06:36,129 --> 00:06:39,009
get to have a child and then they're

156
00:06:37,569 --> 00:06:41,259
desperate and you know they spend a

157
00:06:39,009 --> 00:06:42,879
decade doing fertility treatments or

158
00:06:41,259 --> 00:06:44,319
that sort of thing and immersing

159
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:46,419
themselves in one disappointment after

160
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:50,710
another and it's just at that point you

161
00:06:46,419 --> 00:06:53,289
see exactly how catastrophic it is it

162
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:57,039
can be how catastrophic it can be for

163
00:06:53,289 --> 00:06:58,300
people not to have one of the not to be

164
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:01,839
able to undergo one of the great

165
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:03,969
adventures of life let's say and one of

166
00:07:01,839 --> 00:07:06,279
the things this story does by by

167
00:07:03,969 --> 00:07:07,959
delaying the arrival of Isaac and

168
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:10,959
delaying the arrival of Isaac

169
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:12,729
continually is to exaggerate the the

170
00:07:10,959 --> 00:07:13,750
important significance of the child

171
00:07:12,729 --> 00:07:16,060
because it is

172
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:17,770
until you're deprived of something it's

173
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:19,120
truly not until you're deprived of

174
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:21,400
something that you have any sense of

175
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:23,290
what its value is and Isaac was waiting

176
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:25,060
or Abraham was waiting a very long time

177
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:26,950
a hundred years a very long time

178
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:28,780
and the same with Sarah and so they're

179
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:31,870
unbelievably excited and of course this

180
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:33,850
also heightens the drama that's inherent

181
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:35,980
in the entire sacrificial story because

182
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:37,300
it's not only that eventually that

183
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:39,550
Abraham is called upon to sacrifice

184
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:41,760
Isaac which would be bad enough under

185
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:44,380
any other any circumstances whatsoever

186
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:46,930
self-evidently but the fact that he's

187
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:49,660
been waiting a century for the arrival

188
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:51,669
of this child desperately and made all

189
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:53,680
the proper sacrifices and lived in the

190
00:07:51,669 --> 00:07:57,390
appropriate manner to allow this to

191
00:07:53,680 --> 00:08:05,800
occur dramatically heightens the

192
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:08,560
literary tension now you remember Hagar

193
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:12,310
this is the next part of the story Hagar

194
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:14,650
was is was Sarah's handmaid and when

195
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:19,060
Sarah was unable to bear abraham a child

196
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:21,330
she sent him Hagar and Hagar immediately

197
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:25,750
got pregnant and and gave birth to

198
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:27,100
Ishmael and the story picks up from that

199
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:28,720
point here and if this is quite

200
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:30,850
interesting I mentioned the other week

201
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,770
when I was talking to you guys a couple

202
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:34,570
of weeks in a row just how interesting

203
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:36,250
it has been to scour the internet for

204
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:37,719
the for the paintings that are

205
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:40,060
associated with these stories there's

206
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:42,580
just a there's an amazing wealth of

207
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:44,880
great paintings that illustrate every

208
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:47,830
single bit of the of every single

209
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,839
biblical story and it's it's it's a it's

210
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:51,940
really been enlightening to me to find

211
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:55,089
out just exactly how poorly educated I

212
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:58,990
am you know like I I'm a what would you

213
00:08:55,089 --> 00:09:01,330
say I'm I'm a great admirer of artistic

214
00:08:58,990 --> 00:09:03,070
talent and of artistic endeavor but

215
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:05,020
there's so much I don't know about the

216
00:09:03,070 --> 00:09:07,690
history of art that it's just absolutely

217
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:09,940
beyond belief and to see this treasure

218
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:11,770
trove of images that I really had no

219
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:13,810
idea that existed of course they're

220
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:15,070
spread all over the world and it's only

221
00:09:13,810 --> 00:09:18,280
been in recent years that you could have

222
00:09:15,070 --> 00:09:20,680
access to them and in this way just it's

223
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:23,470
just it's a it's a it's a constant

224
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:25,690
revelation of the depth to which these

225
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:27,529
stories have absolutely permeated our

226
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:30,259
culture and the loss that it would be

227
00:09:27,529 --> 00:09:31,910
if we didn't know them properly and and

228
00:09:30,259 --> 00:09:35,600
take them with a degree of seriousness

229
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:37,970
that they deserve so anyways this is one

230
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,069
of those great images and Sarah saw the

231
00:09:37,970 --> 00:09:44,329
son of Hagar the Egyptian which she had

232
00:09:40,069 --> 00:09:45,980
born unto Abraham mocking wherefore she

233
00:09:44,329 --> 00:09:48,290
said unto Abraham cast out this

234
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:49,939
bondwoman and her son for the son of

235
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:52,759
this bondwoman shall not be heir with my

236
00:09:49,939 --> 00:09:54,559
son even with Isaac and the thing was

237
00:09:52,759 --> 00:09:56,420
very Grievous in Abraham's sight because

238
00:09:54,559 --> 00:09:58,819
of his son was being quite a bit of

239
00:09:56,420 --> 00:10:01,040
tension between Abraham or between Sarah

240
00:09:58,819 --> 00:10:02,899
and Hagar as you could imagine there

241
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,670
might be why wouldn't there be I mean

242
00:10:02,899 --> 00:10:06,980
first of all Hagar had the first child

243
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:09,499
and and that elevated her status and she

244
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:11,209
was Sarah's made handmaiden so that's

245
00:10:09,499 --> 00:10:15,499
obviously going to be quite awkward and

246
00:10:11,209 --> 00:10:17,029
then she she lorded it over Sarah

247
00:10:15,499 --> 00:10:19,009
because of the fact that she got

248
00:10:17,029 --> 00:10:21,800
pregnant so easily and now we see this

249
00:10:19,009 --> 00:10:25,329
situation where Ishmael is doing the

250
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:27,649
same thing with regards to Isaac and

251
00:10:25,329 --> 00:10:30,050
that causes a substantial amount of

252
00:10:27,649 --> 00:10:32,540
trouble the family is a familial

253
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:35,600
division occurring here God said unto

254
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:37,399
Abraham let it not be Grievous in thy

255
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,589
sight because of the lad and because of

256
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:41,420
the bondwoman in all that Sarah hath

257
00:10:39,589 --> 00:10:43,939
said unto thee hearken unto her voice

258
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:46,399
for in Isaac shall thy seed be called

259
00:10:43,939 --> 00:10:48,500
and but also of the son of the bondwoman

260
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,809
will I make a nation because he is thy

261
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:53,329
seed that's so that's it that's an

262
00:10:50,809 --> 00:10:55,129
interesting outcome to you know we we

263
00:10:53,329 --> 00:10:57,470
pointed out before we discussed before

264
00:10:55,129 --> 00:11:00,559
the fact that because Abraham has made

265
00:10:57,470 --> 00:11:02,180
has lived his life properly and has kept

266
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:03,800
the contract with God there's every

267
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:06,680
evidence in the story that no matter

268
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:09,290
what the vicissitudes of Abraham's life

269
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:11,629
you know how the Great Serpent that he

270
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:14,389
sits on in some sense weaves back and

271
00:11:11,629 --> 00:11:16,459
forth there's always the promise that

272
00:11:14,389 --> 00:11:18,079
things will work out positively and you

273
00:11:16,459 --> 00:11:20,660
know you could read that as naive

274
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:23,600
optimism but I think it has a lot more

275
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:26,120
to do with the actual power of keeping

276
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:28,009
the contractual agreement because I

277
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:29,629
really do believe and I've spent a

278
00:11:28,009 --> 00:11:31,129
tremendous amount of time thinking about

279
00:11:29,629 --> 00:11:32,749
this over the last couple of weeks in

280
00:11:31,129 --> 00:11:35,809
addition to the decades before that is

281
00:11:32,749 --> 00:11:37,250
that it and all that's happened since

282
00:11:35,809 --> 00:11:38,870
I've been doing these biblical lectures

283
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,980
is that my conviction in this is being

284
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:40,900
strengthened which is quite interesting

285
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:44,529
is that

286
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:46,360
if you if you do what it is that you're

287
00:11:44,529 --> 00:11:50,400
called upon to do which is to lift your

288
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:53,230
eyes up above the mundane daily selfish

289
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:55,390
impulsive issues that might be set you

290
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:57,730
an attempt to enter into a contractual

291
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:59,710
relationship with that which you might

292
00:11:57,730 --> 00:12:02,830
hold in the highest regard whatever that

293
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:05,740
might be to aim high and to and to and

294
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:07,930
to make that important above all else in

295
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:09,790
your life that that fortifies you

296
00:12:07,930 --> 00:12:11,620
against the vicissitudes of existence

297
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:13,990
like nothing else can and I truly

298
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:17,830
believe that that's the most practical

299
00:12:13,990 --> 00:12:19,600
advice that you can possibly that you

300
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:22,630
could possibly receive you know I

301
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,550
received I was answering questions last

302
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:27,700
night I did this Q&A which I do about

303
00:12:24,550 --> 00:12:29,200
once a month for for the people who are

304
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:31,750
supporting me on patreon which I also

305
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:33,370
release on YouTube and somebody asked

306
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:35,410
you know they were struggling with their

307
00:12:33,370 --> 00:12:37,360
religious faith and they asked what they

308
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:40,000
could do about that and I'd also been

309
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,680
thinking about the the difference

310
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,800
between Nietzsche and Dostoevsky which

311
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:46,300
I'll discuss in a minute and I was

312
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,750
trying to answer this question with

313
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:51,790
regards to religious faith because this

314
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:53,170
person was shaky in his faith in life

315
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:55,990
let's say which is a better way of

316
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:57,640
thinking about it and and it seems to me

317
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:59,290
that the way that you fortify your faith

318
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:01,330
in being and in life and your own

319
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:03,910
existence isn't to try to convince

320
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:06,459
yourself of the existence of a

321
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:07,870
transcendent power that you could

322
00:13:06,459 --> 00:13:09,700
believe in the same way that you believe

323
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:11,230
in a set of empirical fact I don't I

324
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:13,860
don't think that's the right approach I

325
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:15,900
think it's a weak approach actually I

326
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:17,800
don't think that the cognitive

327
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:19,750
technology that I don't think that's the

328
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:22,110
right cognitive technology for that set

329
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:23,980
of problems you know that's more

330
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:25,450
technology that you'd use if you're

331
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:29,080
trying to solve a scientific problem

332
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:31,089
it's more like it's more something that

333
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:33,279
needs to be embedded in action rather

334
00:13:31,089 --> 00:13:35,260
than in stainable belief and the way

335
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:37,870
that you fortify your faith in life is

336
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:39,339
to assume the best something like that

337
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:41,800
and then to act courageously in

338
00:13:39,339 --> 00:13:44,410
relationship to that and and that's

339
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:46,240
that's tantamount to expressing your

340
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:47,830
faith in the highest possible good it's

341
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,870
tantamount to expressing your faith in

342
00:13:47,830 --> 00:13:51,790
God and it's not a matter of stating

343
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:53,950
well I believe in the existence of a

344
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:54,550
transcendent deity because in some sense

345
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:57,370
who care

346
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:59,410
who cares what you believe I mean you

347
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:01,570
might and all that but but that's not

348
00:13:59,410 --> 00:14:04,029
the issue it's not the issue the issue

349
00:14:01,570 --> 00:14:06,580
it seems to me is how you act and I was

350
00:14:04,029 --> 00:14:08,050
thinking about this intensely when I was

351
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,890
thinking about Nietzsche and Dostoyevsky

352
00:14:08,050 --> 00:14:11,260
because of course you know that

353
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:13,000
Nietzsche was the philosopher who

354
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:14,950
announced the death of God right and who

355
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:17,140
was a great great critic of Christianity

356
00:14:14,950 --> 00:14:19,089
at vicious critic of institutional

357
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:21,970
Christianity in the best sense you know

358
00:14:19,089 --> 00:14:23,950
and he announced the death of God and he

359
00:14:21,970 --> 00:14:25,540
said that we'd never find enough water

360
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:27,579
to wash away the blood it wasn't a

361
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:31,079
triumphant proclamation even though it's

362
00:14:27,579 --> 00:14:33,700
often read that way and don't choose

363
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:35,320
conclusion from that from the death of

364
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:36,430
God the fact that our ethical systems

365
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,930
were going to collapse when the

366
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:39,610
foundation was pulled out from

367
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:40,720
underneath them he believed that human

368
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:43,120
beings would have to find their own

369
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,829
values to create their own values and

370
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:46,300
there's a problem with that because it

371
00:14:44,829 --> 00:14:49,269
doesn't seem that this is something Carl

372
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:50,589
Jung was very thorough in investigating

373
00:14:49,269 --> 00:14:52,779
it doesn't really look like people are

374
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:54,730
capable of creating their own values

375
00:14:52,779 --> 00:14:56,890
because you're not really capable of

376
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:58,690
molding yourself just any old way you

377
00:14:56,890 --> 00:15:01,630
want to be like you have a nature that

378
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:03,820
you have to contend with and so it isn't

379
00:15:01,630 --> 00:15:05,320
a matter of creating our own values

380
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:07,360
because we don't have that capacity it

381
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:09,100
might be a matter of rediscovering those

382
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,670
values which is what human was

383
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:14,260
attempting to do now and and and so I

384
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:16,810
think Nietzsche was actually profoundly

385
00:15:14,260 --> 00:15:18,279
wrong in that in that recommendation I

386
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:22,420
think he was psychologically wrong now

387
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:24,579
you know Dostoevsky wrote in many ways

388
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:26,140
in parallel to Nietzsche was a great

389
00:15:24,579 --> 00:15:27,670
influence on Nietzsche their lives

390
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:29,740
parallel each other to a degree that's

391
00:15:27,670 --> 00:15:32,380
somewhat miraculous in some sense it's

392
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:34,240
it's quite uncanny Dorothea Eskie was

393
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:36,880
obviously a literary figure whereas

394
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,850
nature was a philosopher a literary

395
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:41,020
philosopher but still a philosopher and

396
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:43,240
Dostoyevsky wrestled with exactly the

397
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:45,730
same problems that that Nietzsche

398
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:47,980
wrestled with and but he did it in a

399
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:50,709
different way he didn't literary matter

400
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:52,149
and he has this great book and The

401
00:15:50,709 --> 00:15:54,370
Brothers Karamazov and in that book

402
00:15:52,149 --> 00:15:57,190
there's a hero of the book is really a

403
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:59,949
lyosha who's a monastic novitiate a very

404
00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:02,410
good guy kind of not an intellect not an

405
00:15:59,949 --> 00:16:03,760
intellect but a person of great

406
00:16:02,410 --> 00:16:05,290
character you know and but he has a

407
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:07,060
brother Ivan who's his older brother

408
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:08,170
who's a great intellect and and a very

409
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:10,300
handsome so

410
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:12,790
a brave man and like Dostoyevsky's

411
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:13,660
villains Ivan isn't exactly a villain

412
00:16:12,790 --> 00:16:16,120
but that's close enough

413
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:18,339
Ivan our Dostoevsky makes his villains

414
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,480
extraordinarily powerful so if dusty

415
00:16:18,339 --> 00:16:23,170
esti is trying to work out an argument

416
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:25,570
he he closed the argument in the in the

417
00:16:23,170 --> 00:16:27,070
flesh of one of his characters and if

418
00:16:25,570 --> 00:16:28,870
it's an argument he doesn't agree with

419
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:30,490
and he makes that character as strong as

420
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:32,320
he possibly can as strong and as

421
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:33,910
attractive and intelligent as he

422
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:37,240
possibly can and then he lets him just

423
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:39,670
have at her and so Ivan is constantly

424
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:41,290
attacking Elly OSHA and from every

425
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:43,810
direction trying to knock him off his

426
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:46,720
perch of faith let's say and and elosha

427
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:49,240
Alyosha can't address a single one of

428
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:51,010
Ivan's criticisms and and he doesn't

429
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:53,410
have the intellect for it and and and

430
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:56,649
Ivan has a devastating intellect it's

431
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:57,850
devastating to him himself as well what

432
00:16:56,649 --> 00:17:00,430
happens in the brothers karamazov

433
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:03,370
essentially is that Alyosha continues to

434
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:05,740
act out his commitment to the good let's

435
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:07,150
say and in that manner he's triumphant

436
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:08,470
it doesn't matter that he loses the

437
00:17:07,150 --> 00:17:10,660
arguments because the arguments aren't

438
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:12,910
exactly the point the arguments in some

439
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:14,860
sense are a side issue because the issue

440
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:17,770
is and this is the existential issue the

441
00:17:14,860 --> 00:17:19,270
issue is not what you believe as if it's

442
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:21,699
a set of facts but how you conduct

443
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:23,230
yourself in the world and so Dostoyevsky

444
00:17:21,699 --> 00:17:25,709
he grasped that and it's one of the

445
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:28,600
things that makes him such a amazing

446
00:17:25,709 --> 00:17:31,510
amazing literary figure an amazing

447
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:34,030
genius because he was smart enough to to

448
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:35,290
formulate the arguments in a manner that

449
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:36,669
no one else really could with the

450
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:38,590
possible exception of Nietzsche and

451
00:17:36,669 --> 00:17:40,750
that's quite an exception and yet he

452
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:42,970
could still using his dramatic

453
00:17:40,750 --> 00:17:45,070
embodiment he could still lay out

454
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:47,200
solutions to the problems that he was

455
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:50,020
describing that are extremely compelling

456
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:54,490
and both crime and punishment which is

457
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:56,830
an amazing thrilling engrossing book and

458
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:58,480
The Brothers Karamazov all of dusty-ass

459
00:17:56,830 --> 00:18:01,090
Keys great books really circulate around

460
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:03,330
around those profound moral issues and

461
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:07,450
so I've learned a tremendous amount from

462
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:09,610
reading him so and God said unto Abraham

463
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:10,870
let it not be Grievous in thy sight

464
00:18:09,610 --> 00:18:12,610
because of the lad and because of thy

465
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:14,919
bondwoman and all that Sarah hath said

466
00:18:12,610 --> 00:18:17,350
unto thee hearken unto her voice for in

467
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:20,049
Isaac for in Isaiah Excel shall thy seed

468
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:21,700
be called and also of the son of the

469
00:18:20,049 --> 00:18:22,060
bondwoman will I make a nation because

470
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,280
it

471
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:26,740
as I seed alright so I commented that

472
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:28,330
Abraham is being blessed in multiple

473
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:29,920
directions even when things are going

474
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:31,860
wrong and this is pretty bad because his

475
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:34,810
family in some sense is breaking up the

476
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:36,550
there's this emphasis in the text that

477
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:39,190
because he's kept this contractual

478
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:40,990
relationship with God that that he's in

479
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:43,510
an arc we could say at that we could put

480
00:18:40,990 --> 00:18:45,580
it that way and that the that he'll

481
00:18:43,510 --> 00:18:46,870
he'll triumph through the vicissitudes

482
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:49,030
of life which is the best you can hope

483
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:50,320
for and it's quite interesting again one

484
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:51,880
of the things that's so powerful about

485
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:53,800
the Abrahamic stories is that it's not

486
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:55,480
like Abraham even though he's chosen by

487
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,950
God it's not like he has an easy time of

488
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:58,390
it he has a rough life I mean it's a

489
00:18:56,950 --> 00:19:01,600
successful life and all that but it's

490
00:18:58,390 --> 00:19:03,610
not it's not it's not it's not without

491
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,050
its troubles that's for sure it's got

492
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:07,180
every sort of trouble you could possibly

493
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:08,470
imagine pretty much and and that's one

494
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:11,350
of the things that makes the story so

495
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:13,420
realistic as far as I'm concerned and

496
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:15,100
Abraham rose up early in the morning and

497
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:17,470
took bread and a bottle of water and

498
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:19,720
gave it unto Hagar putting it on her

499
00:19:17,470 --> 00:19:23,530
shoulder and the child and sent her away

500
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:27,480
and she departed and wandered in the

501
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:29,530
wilderness of Beersheba I found the

502
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:31,270
funny I guess this had more of an

503
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:32,650
emotional impact on me this week than it

504
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:34,600
might have because my daughter just had

505
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:37,000
a baby a week ago and so I've been

506
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:39,790
thinking about this sort of thing know

507
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:42,430
was so happy that that's happened and I

508
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:44,290
was trying to put myself and uh what

509
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:46,750
would you say the conceptual space of

510
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:48,940
the people about who these stories or

511
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:51,250
people who these stories are about and

512
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:53,410
trying to you know notice that the

513
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:55,720
catastrophe that this sort of breakup

514
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:57,400
would actually constitute and you know

515
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:58,870
and the visual images really helped with

516
00:19:57,400 --> 00:20:01,750
that because they're they're so

517
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:03,610
carefully crafted and and they hid the

518
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:05,800
story from so many different directions

519
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:08,470
that you know they add that an

520
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:10,440
additional layer of ocean meaning to it

521
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:13,060
which I found very very significant and

522
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:15,250
the water was spent in the bottle and

523
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:17,140
she cast the child under one of the

524
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:18,850
shrubs and she sent to wander in the

525
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:19,870
desert you know so it's not just that

526
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:22,690
she has to leave

527
00:20:19,870 --> 00:20:25,360
Abraham's household it's that where she

528
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:28,300
goes is not really amenable to life and

529
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:32,590
so it's it's an extraordinarily dramatic

530
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:34,660
and terrible tale and she went and sat

531
00:20:32,590 --> 00:20:35,440
her down over against him a good way off

532
00:20:34,660 --> 00:20:38,440
as

533
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:40,990
were a bow shot for she said let me not

534
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:42,850
see the death of the child and she sat

535
00:20:40,990 --> 00:20:47,049
over against him and lift up her voice

536
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:49,539
and wept and God heard the voice of the

537
00:20:47,049 --> 00:20:51,309
loud and the angel of God called to

538
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:56,350
Hagar out of heaven and said unto her

539
00:20:51,309 --> 00:20:58,389
what aileth thee Hagar fear not for God

540
00:20:56,350 --> 00:21:02,559
have heard the voice of the lad where he

541
00:20:58,389 --> 00:21:04,269
is rise lift up the loud and hold him in

542
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:08,379
9 hand for I will make him a great

543
00:21:04,269 --> 00:21:10,299
nation and God opened her eyes and she

544
00:21:08,379 --> 00:21:14,409
saw a well of water and she went and

545
00:21:10,299 --> 00:21:19,450
filled the bog with water and gave the

546
00:21:14,409 --> 00:21:21,070
lad drink and God was with the lad and

547
00:21:19,450 --> 00:21:23,710
he grew and dwelt in the wilderness and

548
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:25,899
became an archer that's actually a

549
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:28,029
relevant detail to the fact that he

550
00:21:25,899 --> 00:21:29,320
became an archer because I think I

551
00:21:28,029 --> 00:21:31,299
mentioned to you at one point that the

552
00:21:29,320 --> 00:21:32,799
word sin is derived from a Greek word

553
00:21:31,299 --> 00:21:34,509
amar kiya even though it sounds nothing

554
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:38,019
like that word and Hammar kiya is

555
00:21:34,509 --> 00:21:41,049
actually a an archery term and it means

556
00:21:38,019 --> 00:21:43,659
- it means to miss the bullseye and

557
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:46,480
that's a that's a lovely metaphor for

558
00:21:43,659 --> 00:21:48,370
sin I think because it's associated so

559
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:51,220
tightly with the idea of of goal

560
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:53,889
direction and and aim you know because

561
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:56,350
there's an emetic Oracle idea that's

562
00:21:53,889 --> 00:21:57,879
embedded in that in that image and that

563
00:21:56,350 --> 00:22:00,700
is that you know a human being is

564
00:21:57,879 --> 00:22:02,139
something that specifies a target which

565
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:03,490
we do all the time with their eyes by

566
00:22:02,139 --> 00:22:05,679
the way I mean our eyes our target

567
00:22:03,490 --> 00:22:08,649
specifying mechanisms you know we have

568
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:10,990
very precise central focal vision and we

569
00:22:08,649 --> 00:22:12,850
use our focal vision to target the aim

570
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:15,129
of our behavior and so we are aiming

571
00:22:12,850 --> 00:22:17,710
creatures there's our it's built right

572
00:22:15,129 --> 00:22:19,240
into our Plouffe or body or we're built

573
00:22:17,710 --> 00:22:21,639
on a hunting platform or aiming

574
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:24,100
creatures and we do that cognitively as

575
00:22:21,639 --> 00:22:25,750
well as behaviorally and so as hunters

576
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:27,279
we take aim at things that we take aim

577
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:28,840
at moving targets and we're very good at

578
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:31,029
bringing them down and we've been doing

579
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:33,129
that for who knows how long millions of

580
00:22:31,029 --> 00:22:34,929
years really even chimpanzees are

581
00:22:33,129 --> 00:22:36,580
carnivorous by the way at least but from

582
00:22:34,929 --> 00:22:39,279
them about 6 million years ago so we've

583
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:41,559
been hunting and aiming for a very very

584
00:22:39,279 --> 00:22:43,090
long period of time and we still have

585
00:22:41,559 --> 00:22:44,649
aims in our life right and that's how we

586
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:45,970
describe them what are you aiming at or

587
00:22:44,649 --> 00:22:49,270
what are your aims what are your goals

588
00:22:45,970 --> 00:22:52,090
what's your target it's all based on

589
00:22:49,270 --> 00:22:54,070
not hunting metaphor and the fact that

590
00:22:52,090 --> 00:22:56,140
Ishmael becomes an archer means that

591
00:22:54,070 --> 00:22:58,020
he's someone who can take him at the

592
00:22:56,140 --> 00:23:00,370
center of the bullseye and hit it

593
00:22:58,020 --> 00:23:06,700
precisely and so that's an indication

594
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:09,100
that he's a good man right so and and I

595
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:10,780
suppose also part of the part of it

596
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:11,860
carries part of the narrative weight of

597
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:13,720
the story because of course he's

598
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:15,100
Abraham's son and you'd expect Abraham's

599
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:17,140
son to be someone who's very good at

600
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:18,970
taking aim and he dwelt in the

601
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:20,950
wilderness of paran and he could live

602
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:23,140
there and survive which is no trivial

603
00:23:20,950 --> 00:23:26,860
thing and his mother took him a wife out

604
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:28,150
of the land of Egypt okay so that's the

605
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:29,710
story of Hagar and it's a fairly

606
00:23:28,150 --> 00:23:32,320
straightforward story it's complex

607
00:23:29,710 --> 00:23:35,320
emotionally but it doesn't and it and it

608
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:38,010
brings up the terrible theme of familial

609
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:40,840
catastrophe and the complications of

610
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:43,030
romantic and familial relationships and

611
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:45,460
all of that but it's really serves as a

612
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:48,070
pro drama to the next story which is the

613
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:52,960
one that's so complex and so difficult

614
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:57,180
to understand and it came to pass after

615
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:59,470
these things that God did tempt Abraham

616
00:23:57,180 --> 00:24:03,490
which is a funny thing for God to do I

617
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:09,190
suppose and said unto Him Abraham and he

618
00:24:03,490 --> 00:24:13,060
said behold Here I am and God said take

619
00:24:09,190 --> 00:24:15,010
now thy son thine only son Isaac who the

620
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:17,710
lovest and at the end of the land of

621
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:20,170
Moriah and offer him there for a burnt

622
00:24:17,710 --> 00:24:23,040
offering upon one of the mountains which

623
00:24:20,170 --> 00:24:23,040
I will tell thee up

624
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:32,289
and Abraham rose up early in the morning

625
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:34,350
and saddled his ass and took two of his

626
00:24:32,289 --> 00:24:36,639
young men with him and Isaac his son and

627
00:24:34,350 --> 00:24:38,860
clave the wood for the burnt offering it

628
00:24:36,639 --> 00:24:41,860
rose up and went unto the place of which

629
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:43,929
God had told him then on the third day

630
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:46,809
of journeying Abraham lifted up his eyes

631
00:24:43,929 --> 00:24:49,149
and saw the place afar off the neighbor

632
00:24:46,809 --> 00:24:51,789
hem said unto his young men abide ye ye

633
00:24:49,149 --> 00:24:54,970
here with the ass and I and the lad will

634
00:24:51,789 --> 00:25:00,909
go yonder and worship and come again to

635
00:24:54,970 --> 00:25:02,620
you it's really one of the first times

636
00:25:00,909 --> 00:25:04,000
that we've come across the word worship

637
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:06,090
if I remember correctly and that's a

638
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:10,450
very difficult word to contend with to

639
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:11,620
know is he if you like me or if you're

640
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:12,610
like me when I was a kid because I

641
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:14,559
haven't thought about this for a long

642
00:25:12,610 --> 00:25:16,389
time it was never really obvious to me

643
00:25:14,559 --> 00:25:18,429
why God would want to be worshipped you

644
00:25:16,389 --> 00:25:20,889
know as to go to church and you offer up

645
00:25:18,429 --> 00:25:22,990
your praise and thanks to God and you

646
00:25:20,889 --> 00:25:24,700
say well really does that make a lot of

647
00:25:22,990 --> 00:25:26,710
sense it's like why in the world is that

648
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:29,110
what he wants it's like it's almost like

649
00:25:26,710 --> 00:25:32,080
you're you're you're you're kneeling

650
00:25:29,110 --> 00:25:32,860
down in front of an ancient Middle

651
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,159
Eastern

652
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:39,130
you know tyrannical Emperor and and

653
00:25:35,159 --> 00:25:41,350
vowing your submission and that never

654
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:42,820
sat well with me and I suppose it

655
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:44,409
doesn't sit well with many people and I

656
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:46,659
think that's because it's it's not the

657
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:48,549
proper way of conceptualizing it like

658
00:25:46,659 --> 00:25:50,559
what happens when you see what Abraham

659
00:25:48,549 --> 00:25:53,380
does continually and this seems to be

660
00:25:50,559 --> 00:25:56,559
implicit in the use of the word worship

661
00:25:53,380 --> 00:25:58,690
in this particular situation is that you

662
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:00,490
know he as we discussed he has an

663
00:25:58,690 --> 00:26:02,019
adventure in his life that comes to an

664
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:03,220
end so there's an episode in this life

665
00:26:02,019 --> 00:26:06,370
it comes to an end and then there's a

666
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:08,409
period of you might consider it re where

667
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:10,120
he reconstitutes himself to some degree

668
00:26:08,409 --> 00:26:12,220
and it's that's when he makes the

669
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:14,260
sacrifices and it seems to me that it's

670
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:15,760
that reconstitution that constitutes the

671
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:18,100
worship the worship is something like

672
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:19,750
you know this is alluding back to my

673
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:22,059
original proposition that it's how you

674
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:25,120
act that's the issue and the worship is

675
00:26:22,059 --> 00:26:26,559
the decision to enact the good in

676
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,659
whatever form it is that you can

677
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:30,820
conceptualize it as well as trying to

678
00:26:28,659 --> 00:26:32,559
continually reconceptualize the good in

679
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:34,299
a manner that makes the good that you're

680
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:36,850
conceptualizing even that much better

681
00:26:34,299 --> 00:26:38,080
right because when you start aiming the

682
00:26:36,850 --> 00:26:39,730
probability that you're going to be

683
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,950
aiming in the right direction is very

684
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:43,090
low but

685
00:26:40,950 --> 00:26:45,610
hypothetically as you aim and as you

686
00:26:43,090 --> 00:26:48,100
practice and as you learn the target is

687
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:48,910
going to shift in front of your eyes and

688
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:50,980
you're going to be able to follow

689
00:26:48,910 --> 00:26:53,380
whatever more clearly and so and that

690
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:55,510
seems to me and especially given the

691
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:57,040
context that this word is used in this

692
00:26:55,510 --> 00:26:59,020
particular story is much more

693
00:26:57,040 --> 00:27:00,880
appropriate interpretation of what

694
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:03,280
constitutes proper worship and I suppose

695
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:05,590
it's akin to the later Christian idea

696
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:08,800
that it's the imitation of Christ that's

697
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:11,380
the sacred duty of every Christian of

698
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:13,600
every Christian and every human being I

699
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:16,630
suppose insofar as that's an archetypal

700
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:19,480
idea an idea is something like well it's

701
00:27:16,630 --> 00:27:22,420
the embodiment of the good that's the

702
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:24,280
issue and it's not your stated belief in

703
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:25,990
the good and you know when nature was

704
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:27,280
criticizing Christianity this is

705
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:29,350
actually one of the things that he

706
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:30,910
brought up as a major issue he said that

707
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:33,070
he believed Christianity had lost its

708
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:35,890
way because it had introduced a

709
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:37,210
confusion between stated belief which is

710
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:39,220
say your belief in the divinity of

711
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:41,290
Christ whatever it means if you state

712
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:42,760
that it isn't obvious what it means that

713
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:44,440
when you state that because it isn't

714
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:45,910
obvious what it would mean that you

715
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:48,040
believe it or even what it is that

716
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:49,780
you're believing in as far as Nietzsche

717
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:51,640
was concerned in some sense not only was

718
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:53,700
that beside the point it was dangerously

719
00:27:51,640 --> 00:27:58,120
beside the point because it actually

720
00:27:53,700 --> 00:28:00,220
allowed the Christian believer not to

721
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:03,100
adopt the moral burden that was actually

722
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:05,760
appropriate to the faith which was - and

723
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:08,680
this is I'm using a kind of a Union

724
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:10,630
concept here to manifest the archetype

725
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:13,060
within the confines of your own life

726
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:14,320
and that's to make the divine that your

727
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:15,850
relationship with the divine your

728
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:18,000
relationship with the transcendent an

729
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:20,380
infinite into something that's actually

730
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,330
realizable in the context of your own

731
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:24,160
life which is to say well you know

732
00:28:22,330 --> 00:28:26,170
you're supposed to you're supposed to

733
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:27,520
again to act out the highest good of

734
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:29,230
which you're capable now that will

735
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,120
transform your life to some degree into

736
00:28:29,230 --> 00:28:33,750
an archetypal adventure there's no way

737
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:36,310
around that because as you attempt to

738
00:28:33,750 --> 00:28:37,990
climb a higher mountain let's say or to

739
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:39,700
aim at a higher target or something like

740
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:42,430
that then the things around you will

741
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:44,460
become increasingly dramatic and of

742
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:46,810
import that happens by necessity

743
00:28:44,460 --> 00:28:49,000
obviously because if you're aiming at

744
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:50,890
something difficult and profound and

745
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:52,270
you're really working at it then your

746
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:54,430
life is going to become perhaps

747
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:54,759
increasingly difficult and profound but

748
00:28:54,430 --> 00:28:56,079
that

749
00:28:54,759 --> 00:28:58,929
might be okay you might that might be

750
00:28:56,079 --> 00:29:01,509
exactly what you need as an antidote to

751
00:28:58,929 --> 00:29:14,199
the implicit limitations that face you

752
00:29:01,509 --> 00:29:15,759
as a human being so and I am the lad

753
00:29:14,199 --> 00:29:17,559
will go yonder and worship and come

754
00:29:15,759 --> 00:29:20,049
again to you now there's an implication

755
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:22,659
here too that it's a foreshadowing that

756
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:24,249
that Abraham offering up his son is

757
00:29:22,659 --> 00:29:26,199
actually a form of worship and that's

758
00:29:24,249 --> 00:29:28,869
that it's continuous with what he's

759
00:29:26,199 --> 00:29:30,129
already done and well now I'm going to

760
00:29:28,869 --> 00:29:32,259
read you some of the things that I've

761
00:29:30,129 --> 00:29:38,949
written and then all return to this and

762
00:29:32,259 --> 00:29:43,329
we'll see how that goes so life is

763
00:29:38,949 --> 00:29:46,239
suffering that's clear there's no more

764
00:29:43,329 --> 00:29:49,269
basic irrefutable truth it's basically

765
00:29:46,239 --> 00:29:51,789
as we've seen what God tells out of and

766
00:29:49,269 --> 00:29:55,179
Eve immediately before he kicks them out

767
00:29:51,789 --> 00:29:57,039
of paradise quote unto the woman he said

768
00:29:55,179 --> 00:30:00,039
I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and

769
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:02,409
thy conception in sorrow thou shalt

770
00:30:00,039 --> 00:30:04,989
bring forth children and thy desire

771
00:30:02,409 --> 00:30:07,179
shall be to thy husband and he shall

772
00:30:04,989 --> 00:30:09,309
rule over thee and unto Adam he said

773
00:30:07,179 --> 00:30:11,379
because you have hearkened unto the

774
00:30:09,309 --> 00:30:13,029
voice of thy wife and hast eaten of the

775
00:30:11,379 --> 00:30:15,729
tree which I commanded thee saying thou

776
00:30:13,029 --> 00:30:19,179
shalt not eat of it cursed is the ground

777
00:30:15,729 --> 00:30:21,879
for thy sake in sorrow shalt thou eat of

778
00:30:19,179 --> 00:30:23,799
it all the days of thy life thorns also

779
00:30:21,879 --> 00:30:26,440
and thistles shall it bring forth to

780
00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:28,690
thee and thou shalt eat the herb of the

781
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:30,129
field by the sweat of your brow you will

782
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:32,169
eat your food until you return to the

783
00:30:30,129 --> 00:30:34,979
ground since from it you were taken for

784
00:30:32,169 --> 00:30:38,739
dust you are and to dust you will return

785
00:30:34,979 --> 00:30:41,979
rough you know and we've associated that

786
00:30:38,739 --> 00:30:44,199
with with Adam and Eve's eyes opening

787
00:30:41,979 --> 00:30:46,179
and then becoming self conscious and

788
00:30:44,199 --> 00:30:48,639
discovering the future and becoming

789
00:30:46,179 --> 00:30:50,559
fully aware and falling into history and

790
00:30:48,639 --> 00:30:52,719
it seems to me to be a very realistic

791
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:56,349
existential portrayal of the predicament

792
00:30:52,719 --> 00:30:59,589
of humankind what in the world should be

793
00:30:56,349 --> 00:31:03,669
done about that the simplest most

794
00:30:59,589 --> 00:31:06,729
obvious and most direct answer pursue

795
00:31:03,669 --> 00:31:08,140
pleasure to follow your impulses live

796
00:31:06,729 --> 00:31:11,770
for the moment do

797
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:15,250
expedient lie cheat steal deceive

798
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:17,050
manipulate but don't get caught in an

799
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:18,780
ultimately meaningless universe what

800
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:22,330
possible difference could it make and

801
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:23,920
this is by no means a new idea the fact

802
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:25,290
of life's tragedy in the suffering that

803
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:27,730
is part of it has been used to justify

804
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:30,250
the pursuit of immediate selfish

805
00:31:27,730 --> 00:31:34,600
gratification for a very long time

806
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:38,260
now even reading young he often writes

807
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:40,090
as if before the rise of the conflict

808
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:41,920
between religion and science and which

809
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:44,430
culminated saying each his pronouncement

810
00:31:41,920 --> 00:31:47,200
about the death of God that people lived

811
00:31:44,430 --> 00:31:48,850
ensconce quite safely within a religious

812
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,620
conceptualization that have you´d their

813
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:52,420
life with meaning and that that was and

814
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:53,740
that was just the state of reality you

815
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:55,780
know but there's ancient writings that

816
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:57,640
makes it quite clear that the crisis of

817
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:59,920
faith that characterizes a modern people

818
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:02,470
were certainly far from unknown in the

819
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:06,130
past and here's one of those writings

820
00:32:02,470 --> 00:32:09,490
this is from wisdom - the Revised

821
00:32:06,130 --> 00:32:12,880
Standard Version short and sorrowful is

822
00:32:09,490 --> 00:32:15,340
our life and there is no remedy when a

823
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:18,700
man comes to his end and no one has been

824
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:21,670
known to return from Hades because we

825
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:24,070
were born by mere chance and hereafter

826
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:26,530
we shall be as though we had never been

827
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:30,100
because the breath in our nostrils is

828
00:32:26,530 --> 00:32:32,290
smoke and reason is just a spark kindled

829
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:34,210
by the beating of our hearts when it is

830
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:37,360
extinguished our body will turn to ashes

831
00:32:34,210 --> 00:32:41,560
their spirit will dissolve like empty

832
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:43,600
air our name will be forgotten in time

833
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:46,180
and no one will remember our works our

834
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:48,010
life will pass away like the traces of a

835
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:49,810
cloud and be scattered like mist that is

836
00:32:48,010 --> 00:32:52,870
chased by the Rays of the Sun and

837
00:32:49,810 --> 00:32:55,870
overcome by its heat for our allotted

838
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:57,880
time is but the passing of a shadow and

839
00:32:55,870 --> 00:33:01,180
there is no return from our death

840
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:04,930
because it is sealed up and no one turns

841
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:06,730
back come therefore let us enjoy the

842
00:33:04,930 --> 00:33:10,150
good things that exist and make use of

843
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:12,520
the creation to the full as in youth let

844
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:15,340
us take our fill of costly wines and

845
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:18,580
perfumes and let no flower of spring

846
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:21,220
passes by let us crown ourselves with

847
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:21,970
rosebuds before they wither let none of

848
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:24,820
us fail

849
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:26,890
to share in our revelry everywhere let

850
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:29,680
us leave signs of enjoyment because this

851
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:31,930
is our portion and this is our Lord let

852
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:34,540
us oppress the righteous poor man

853
00:33:31,930 --> 00:33:37,390
let us not spare the widow nor regard

854
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:39,460
the gray hairs of the agent but letter

855
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:44,740
might be our right for what is weak

856
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:48,580
proves itself to be useless it's an

857
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:50,290
amazing piece of writing you know it

858
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:52,600
starts with an announcement of the

859
00:33:50,290 --> 00:33:55,360
rationale for nihilism and ends with the

860
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:57,070
justification for a fascist tyranny you

861
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:59,740
know and it's it's thousands of years

862
00:33:57,070 --> 00:34:03,940
old it's it's a remarkable thing to see

863
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:05,770
and to be laid out so concisely the

864
00:34:03,940 --> 00:34:08,590
pleasure of expediency may be fleeting

865
00:34:05,770 --> 00:34:10,750
but it's pleasure nonetheless and that's

866
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:13,090
something to stack up against the terror

867
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:15,550
and pain of existence every man for

868
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:20,020
himself and the devil take the hindmost

869
00:34:15,550 --> 00:34:21,970
as the old proverb has it why not simply

870
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:24,700
take everything you can get whenever the

871
00:34:21,970 --> 00:34:28,180
opportunity arises why not determine to

872
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:30,880
live in that manner what's the

873
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:31,570
alternative and why should we bother

874
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:33,540
with it

875
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:35,800
our ancestors worked out very

876
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:37,900
sophisticated answers to such questions

877
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:40,390
but we still don't understand them very

878
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:43,030
well this is because they are in large

879
00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:45,690
part still implicit manifest primarily

880
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:49,870
in ritual and myth and as of yet

881
00:34:45,690 --> 00:34:51,670
incompletely articulated we act them out

882
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:54,160
represent them in stories but we're not

883
00:34:51,670 --> 00:34:57,130
wise enough yet to formulate them

884
00:34:54,160 --> 00:34:59,410
explicitly was still chimps in a troop

885
00:34:57,130 --> 00:35:02,050
or wolves in a pack we know how to

886
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:05,380
behave we know who's who and why we've

887
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:07,240
learned that through experience our

888
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:08,590
knowledge has been shaped by our

889
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:10,480
interaction with others we've

890
00:35:08,590 --> 00:35:11,980
established predictable routines and

891
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:14,380
patterns of behavior but we don't really

892
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:18,100
understand them or know where they

893
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:22,030
origin ated they've evolved over great

894
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:24,250
expanses of time no one was formulating

895
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:27,550
them explicitly at least not in the

896
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:29,020
dimmest reaches of the past even though

897
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:32,560
we've been telling each other how to act

898
00:35:29,020 --> 00:35:36,070
forever one day however not so long ago

899
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:38,140
we woke up we were already doing

900
00:35:36,070 --> 00:35:40,000
but we started noticing what we were

901
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:42,750
doing we started using our bodies as

902
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:46,330
devices to represent their own actions

903
00:35:42,750 --> 00:35:48,520
we started imitating and dramatizing we

904
00:35:46,330 --> 00:35:51,970
invented ritual we started acting out

905
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:55,690
our own experiences then we started to

906
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:58,800
tell stories we coated our observations

907
00:35:55,690 --> 00:36:01,420
of our own drama in those stories in

908
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:03,160
this manner the information that was

909
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:05,860
first only embedded in our behavior

910
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:07,450
became represented in our stories but we

911
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:10,690
didn't and we still don't understand

912
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:12,430
what it all meant the biblical narrative

913
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:14,710
of paradise in the fall is one such

914
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:17,460
story fabricated by our collective

915
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:20,950
imagination working over the centuries

916
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:24,070
it provides a profound account of the

917
00:36:20,950 --> 00:36:26,200
nature of being and points the way to a

918
00:36:24,070 --> 00:36:28,060
mode of conceptualization and action

919
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:30,580
well matched to that nature in the

920
00:36:28,060 --> 00:36:32,500
Garden of Eden prior to the dawn of

921
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:41,230
self-consciousness so goes the story

922
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:44,220
human beings were sinless our primordial

923
00:36:41,230 --> 00:36:48,790
parents Adam and Eve walked with God

924
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:50,290
then tempted by the snake the first

925
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:52,390
couple ate from the tree of the

926
00:36:50,290 --> 00:36:54,100
knowledge of good and evil discovered

927
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:58,150
death and vulnerability and turned away

928
00:36:54,100 --> 00:37:00,940
from God mankind was exiled from

929
00:36:58,150 --> 00:37:03,940
paradise and began its effortful mortal

930
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:05,500
existence the idea of sacrifice enter

931
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:07,300
soon afterwards beginning with the

932
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:09,160
account of Cain and Abel and developing

933
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:12,340
as we've seen through the Abrahamic

934
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:14,950
stories after much contemplation

935
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:16,990
struggling humanity learns that God's

936
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:19,450
favor could be gained and his wrath

937
00:37:16,990 --> 00:37:21,400
averted through proper sacrifice and

938
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:23,140
also that bloody murder might be

939
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:28,060
motivated among those unwilling or

940
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:30,250
unable to succeed in this manner when

941
00:37:28,060 --> 00:37:31,750
engaging in sacrifice our forefathers

942
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:33,520
began to act out what would be

943
00:37:31,750 --> 00:37:36,610
considered a proposition if it were

944
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:38,290
stated in words that something better

945
00:37:36,610 --> 00:37:40,030
might be attained in the future by

946
00:37:38,290 --> 00:37:43,030
giving up something of value in the

947
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:44,710
present recall if you will that the

948
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:47,230
necessity for work is one of the curses

949
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:49,660
placed by God upon Adam and his

950
00:37:47,230 --> 00:37:54,309
descendants in consequence of

951
00:37:49,660 --> 00:37:56,859
original sin Adams waking to the

952
00:37:54,309 --> 00:38:00,250
fundamental constraints of his being his

953
00:37:56,859 --> 00:38:02,079
vulnerability his eventual death that's

954
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:06,819
equivalent to the discovery of the

955
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:08,010
future the future that's where you go to

956
00:38:06,819 --> 00:38:11,740
die

957
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:14,319
hopefully not too soon your demise might

958
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:19,450
be staved off through work through the

959
00:38:14,319 --> 00:38:21,400
sacrifice of the now to benefit later it

960
00:38:19,450 --> 00:38:23,049
is for this reason among others no doubt

961
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:24,579
that the concept of sacrifice is

962
00:38:23,049 --> 00:38:26,260
introduced in the biblical chapter

963
00:38:24,579 --> 00:38:28,210
immediately following the drama of the

964
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:31,510
fall there's little difference between

965
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:35,829
sacrifice and work they're also both

966
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:37,630
uniquely human sometimes animals act as

967
00:38:35,829 --> 00:38:39,190
if they're working but they're really

968
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:42,609
only following the dictates of their

969
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:44,380
natures beavers build dams they do so

970
00:38:42,609 --> 00:38:47,799
because their beavers and beavers build

971
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:49,750
dams they don't think yeah but I'd

972
00:38:47,799 --> 00:38:53,250
rather be on a beach in Mexico with my

973
00:38:49,750 --> 00:38:53,250
girlfriend while they're doing it

974
00:38:56,279 --> 00:39:02,980
prosaically such sacrifice work is delay

975
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:05,740
of gratification but that's a very

976
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:08,079
mundane phrase to describe something of

977
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:09,940
soul-shattering significance the

978
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:12,190
discovery that gratification could be

979
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:16,359
delayed was simultaneously the discovery

980
00:39:12,190 --> 00:39:18,520
of time and with it causality long ago

981
00:39:16,359 --> 00:39:20,980
in the dim mists of time we began to

982
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:22,740
realize that reality was structured as

983
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:25,599
if it could be bargained with

984
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:27,700
we learned that behaving properly now in

985
00:39:25,599 --> 00:39:29,650
the present regulating our impulses

986
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:31,630
considering the plight of others could

987
00:39:29,650 --> 00:39:34,089
bring rewards in the future in a time

988
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:36,670
and place that did not yet exist we

989
00:39:34,089 --> 00:39:39,279
began to inhibit control and organize

990
00:39:36,670 --> 00:39:41,079
our immediate impulses so that we could

991
00:39:39,279 --> 00:39:44,410
stop interfering with other people and

992
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:46,930
our future selves doing so was

993
00:39:44,410 --> 00:39:50,680
indistinguishable from organizing

994
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:52,359
society the discovery of the causal

995
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:55,359
relationship between our efforts today

996
00:39:52,359 --> 00:39:57,520
and the quality of tomorrow motivated

997
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:59,319
the social contract the organization

998
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:02,140
that enables today's work to be stored

999
00:39:59,319 --> 00:40:04,450
reliably mostly in the form of promises

1000
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:06,980
from others

1001
00:40:04,450 --> 00:40:10,330
understanding is something that's often

1002
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:13,310
acted out before it can be articulated

1003
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:15,320
just as a child acts out what it means

1004
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:17,089
to be mother or father before being able

1005
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:20,270
to give a spoken account of what those

1006
00:40:17,089 --> 00:40:23,560
roles mean the idea the act of making a

1007
00:40:20,270 --> 00:40:26,330
ritual sacrifice to God was an early and

1008
00:40:23,560 --> 00:40:29,750
sophisticated enactment of the idea of

1009
00:40:26,330 --> 00:40:31,400
the usefulness of delay there's a long

1010
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:33,740
conceptual journey between merely

1011
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:36,080
feasting hungrily and learning to set

1012
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:37,609
aside some extra meat smoked by the fire

1013
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:39,589
for the end of the day or for someone

1014
00:40:37,609 --> 00:40:42,710
who isn't present it takes a long time

1015
00:40:39,589 --> 00:40:44,960
to learn to keep anything later for

1016
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:46,760
yourself or to share it with someone

1017
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:48,980
else and those are very much the same

1018
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:52,400
thing as in the former case you're

1019
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:54,230
sharing with your future self it's much

1020
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:56,150
easier and far more likely to selfishly

1021
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:58,190
it immediately Wolf's down everything in

1022
00:40:56,150 --> 00:41:00,260
sight there are similar long journeys

1023
00:40:58,190 --> 00:41:02,800
between every leap and sophistication

1024
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:05,890
with regards to delay and its

1025
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:08,680
conceptualization short term sharing

1026
00:41:05,890 --> 00:41:10,700
storing away from the for the future

1027
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:12,560
representation of that storage in the

1028
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:14,570
form of Records and later in the form of

1029
00:41:12,560 --> 00:41:16,550
currency and ultimately the saving of

1030
00:41:14,570 --> 00:41:19,339
money in a bank or other institution

1031
00:41:16,550 --> 00:41:21,800
some conceptualizations had to serve as

1032
00:41:19,339 --> 00:41:23,119
intermediaries or the full range of our

1033
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,740
practices and ideas surrounding

1034
00:41:23,119 --> 00:41:26,560
sacrifice and work and their

1035
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:30,820
representation could have never emerged

1036
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:34,430
our ancestors acted out a drama a

1037
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:37,190
literary fiction they personified the

1038
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:40,099
force that governs fate as a spirit that

1039
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:41,720
can be bargained with traded with as if

1040
00:41:40,099 --> 00:41:45,260
it were another human being and the

1041
00:41:41,720 --> 00:41:47,030
amazing thing is that it worked this was

1042
00:41:45,260 --> 00:41:49,310
in part because the future is largely

1043
00:41:47,030 --> 00:41:51,200
composed of other human beings often

1044
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:53,330
precisely those who have watched and

1045
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:56,330
evaluated and appraised the tiniest

1046
00:41:53,330 --> 00:41:58,490
details of your past behavior it's not

1047
00:41:56,330 --> 00:42:01,460
very far from that to God sitting above

1048
00:41:58,490 --> 00:42:03,890
on high tracking your every move and

1049
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:06,980
writing it down for further reference in

1050
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:12,640
a big book here's a productive symbolic

1051
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:15,900
idea the future is a judgmental father

1052
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:18,940
that's a good start

1053
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:21,010
but two additional archetypal

1054
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:23,650
foundational questions arose because of

1055
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:25,540
the discovery of sacrifice of work both

1056
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:29,710
have to do with the ultimate extension

1057
00:42:25,540 --> 00:42:36,460
of the logic of work which is sacrifice

1058
00:42:29,710 --> 00:42:41,140
now to gain later first question what

1059
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:43,420
must be sacrificed small sacrifices

1060
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:46,900
might be sufficient to small to solve

1061
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:49,320
small singular problems but it's

1062
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:52,180
possible that larger more comprehensive

1063
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:53,950
sacrifices might solve an array of large

1064
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:57,400
and complex problems all at the same

1065
00:42:53,950 --> 00:42:59,890
time that's harder but it might be

1066
00:42:57,400 --> 00:43:02,110
better adapting to the necessary

1067
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:04,630
discipline of medical school for example

1068
00:43:02,110 --> 00:43:09,730
will fatally interfere with the licensee

1069
00:43:04,630 --> 00:43:13,930
estoppel giving that up as a sacrifice

1070
00:43:09,730 --> 00:43:21,460
but a physician can to quote George w

1071
00:43:13,930 --> 00:43:23,170
really put food on his family that's a

1072
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:27,040
lot of trouble dispensed with over a

1073
00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:30,000
very long period of time so sacrifices

1074
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:34,450
are necessary to improve the future and

1075
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:36,610
larger sacrifices can be better second

1076
00:43:34,450 --> 00:43:38,200
question introduction we've already

1077
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:41,950
established the basic principle

1078
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:44,170
sacrifice will improve the future but

1079
00:43:41,950 --> 00:43:47,860
what's implied by that in the most

1080
00:43:44,170 --> 00:43:50,620
extreme and final of cases where does

1081
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:53,410
that basic principle find its limits we

1082
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:56,590
must ask to begin with what would be the

1083
00:43:53,410 --> 00:44:00,430
largest most effective most pleasing of

1084
00:43:56,590 --> 00:44:02,320
all possible sacrifices and then how

1085
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:05,740
good might the best possible future be

1086
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:10,690
if the most effective possible sacrifice

1087
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:13,480
could be made the biblical story of Cain

1088
00:44:10,690 --> 00:44:15,760
and Abel Adam and Eve's sons immediately

1089
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:16,300
follows the story of the expulsion from

1090
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:22,570
paradise

1091
00:44:16,300 --> 00:44:25,690
as mentioned previously Cain and Abel

1092
00:44:22,570 --> 00:44:27,910
are really the first humans since their

1093
00:44:25,690 --> 00:44:29,920
parents were made directly by God and

1094
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:32,860
not born in the standard manner Cain and

1095
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:35,020
Abel live in history not in Eden they

1096
00:44:32,860 --> 00:44:37,150
must work they must make sacrifices to

1097
00:44:35,020 --> 00:44:39,510
please God and they do so with altar and

1098
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:42,040
proper ritual but things get complicated

1099
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:45,310
Abel's offerings please God but Cain's

1100
00:44:42,040 --> 00:44:48,520
do not Abel is rewarded many times over

1101
00:44:45,310 --> 00:44:50,140
but Cain is not it's not precisely clear

1102
00:44:48,520 --> 00:44:51,640
why although the text strongly hints

1103
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:53,440
that Cain's heart is just not in it

1104
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:54,550
maybe the quality of what Cain put

1105
00:44:53,440 --> 00:44:57,970
forward was low

1106
00:44:54,550 --> 00:45:00,820
maybe his spirit was begrudging or maybe

1107
00:44:57,970 --> 00:45:02,950
God was just feeling crabby and all of

1108
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:04,990
this is realistic including the texts

1109
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:07,350
vagueness of explanation not all

1110
00:45:04,990 --> 00:45:09,580
sacrifices are of equal quality

1111
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:11,590
furthermore it often appears that

1112
00:45:09,580 --> 00:45:13,780
sacrifices of apparently high quality

1113
00:45:11,590 --> 00:45:16,030
are sometimes not rewarded with a better

1114
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:19,570
future and it's not clear why why isn't

1115
00:45:16,030 --> 00:45:21,910
God happy what would have to change to

1116
00:45:19,570 --> 00:45:24,520
make him so these are difficult

1117
00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:27,160
questions and everyone asks them all the

1118
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:29,020
time even if they don't notice asking

1119
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:33,070
such questions is indistinguishable from

1120
00:45:29,020 --> 00:45:34,840
thinking the realization that pleasure

1121
00:45:33,070 --> 00:45:36,130
could be usefully forestalled dawned

1122
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:39,280
with a difficulty that's almost

1123
00:45:36,130 --> 00:45:42,940
impossible to overstate such a

1124
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:45,610
realization runs absolutely contrary to

1125
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:47,670
our ancient fundamental animal instincts

1126
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:49,450
which demand immediate satisfaction

1127
00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:51,280
particularly under conditions of

1128
00:45:49,450 --> 00:45:53,470
deprivation which are both inevitable

1129
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:56,140
and commonplace and to complicate the

1130
00:45:53,470 --> 00:45:58,690
matter such delay only becomes useful

1131
00:45:56,140 --> 00:46:00,880
when civilization has stabilized itself

1132
00:45:58,690 --> 00:46:03,010
enough to guarantee the existence of the

1133
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:05,230
delayed reward if everything you say

1134
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:08,080
will be destroyed or worse stolen

1135
00:46:05,230 --> 00:46:10,150
there's no point saving it's for this

1136
00:46:08,080 --> 00:46:12,610
reason that a wolf will down 20 pounds

1137
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:14,920
of raw meat in a single meal he isn't

1138
00:46:12,610 --> 00:46:18,000
thinking man I hate it when I binge I

1139
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:20,680
should save some of this for next week

1140
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:23,260
there's a developmental progression from

1141
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:24,880
animal to human it's wrong no doubt in

1142
00:46:23,260 --> 00:46:27,520
the details but it's sufficiently

1143
00:46:24,880 --> 00:46:30,940
correct for our purposes and theme first

1144
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:32,890
there's excess food large carcasses

1145
00:46:30,940 --> 00:46:35,290
mammoths or other massive herbivores

1146
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:36,930
might provide that way a lot of mammoths

1147
00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:39,340
maybe all of the

1148
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:41,430
with a large animal there's some left

1149
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:44,620
for later after a kill

1150
00:46:41,430 --> 00:46:47,920
that's accidental at first but

1151
00:46:44,620 --> 00:46:50,680
eventually the utility of for later

1152
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:52,810
starts to be appreciated some

1153
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:55,410
provisional notion of sacrifice develops

1154
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:58,630
at the same time if I leave some now

1155
00:46:55,410 --> 00:47:02,020
even if I want it now I won't have to be

1156
00:46:58,630 --> 00:47:04,210
hungry later that provisional notion

1157
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:06,460
then develops to the next level if I

1158
00:47:04,210 --> 00:47:08,950
leave some for later I won't have to go

1159
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:11,770
hungry and neither will those I care for

1160
00:47:08,950 --> 00:47:13,780
and then to the next level I can't

1161
00:47:11,770 --> 00:47:16,050
possibly eat all this mammoth but I

1162
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:18,490
can't store the rest for too long either

1163
00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:21,460
maybe I should feed some to other people

1164
00:47:18,490 --> 00:47:23,020
maybe they'll remember and feed me some

1165
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:25,210
of their mammoths when they have some

1166
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:27,550
and I have none then I'll get some

1167
00:47:25,210 --> 00:47:31,480
mammoths now and some mammoths later

1168
00:47:27,550 --> 00:47:33,220
that's a good deal and maybe those I'm

1169
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:35,590
sharing with will come to trust me more

1170
00:47:33,220 --> 00:47:38,590
generally maybe then we could trade

1171
00:47:35,590 --> 00:47:41,460
forever in such a manner

1172
00:47:38,590 --> 00:47:43,860
mammoth becomes future mammoth and

1173
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:47,080
future mammoth becomes personal

1174
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:50,860
reputation that's the emergence of the

1175
00:47:47,080 --> 00:47:52,600
social contract to share does not mean

1176
00:47:50,860 --> 00:47:54,970
to give away something you value and get

1177
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:57,220
nothing back that's only instead what

1178
00:47:54,970 --> 00:47:59,680
every child who refuses to share is

1179
00:47:57,220 --> 00:48:01,570
afraid that it means to share means

1180
00:47:59,680 --> 00:48:06,310
properly to initiate the process of

1181
00:48:01,570 --> 00:48:09,070
trade a child who can't share who can't

1182
00:48:06,310 --> 00:48:11,040
trade can't have any friends because

1183
00:48:09,070 --> 00:48:13,420
having friends is a form of trade

1184
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:15,850
Benjamin Franklin once suggested that a

1185
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:18,720
newcomer to a neighbourhood asked a new

1186
00:48:15,850 --> 00:48:21,850
neighbor to do him or her a favor

1187
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:23,920
citing an old maxim he that has once

1188
00:48:21,850 --> 00:48:26,320
done you a kindness will be more ready

1189
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:28,720
to do you another than he whom you

1190
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:30,540
yourself have obliged in Franklin's

1191
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:33,370
opinion asking something for someone

1192
00:48:30,540 --> 00:48:36,070
asking someone for something not too

1193
00:48:33,370 --> 00:48:38,050
extreme obviously was the most useful

1194
00:48:36,070 --> 00:48:40,060
and immediate invitation to social

1195
00:48:38,050 --> 00:48:41,710
interaction such asking allowed the

1196
00:48:40,060 --> 00:48:44,560
neighbor to show him or herself as a

1197
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:46,060
good person at first encounter it also

1198
00:48:44,560 --> 00:48:48,520
meant the neighbor could now ask the

1199
00:48:46,060 --> 00:48:49,980
newcomer for a favor in return because

1200
00:48:48,520 --> 00:48:51,540
of the debt incurred

1201
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:53,430
in that manner both parties could

1202
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:58,410
overcome their natural hesitancy and

1203
00:48:53,430 --> 00:49:01,670
mutual fear of the stranger it's better

1204
00:48:58,410 --> 00:49:01,670
to have something rather than nothing

1205
00:49:01,790 --> 00:49:07,740
it's better yet to generously share the

1206
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:10,020
something you have it's even better than

1207
00:49:07,740 --> 00:49:12,420
that however to become widely known for

1208
00:49:10,020 --> 00:49:15,060
generous sharing that's something that

1209
00:49:12,420 --> 00:49:17,700
lasts that's something that's reliable

1210
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:19,680
and at this point in abstraction we can

1211
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:21,900
observe how the groundwork for the

1212
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:24,599
conceptions of reliable honest and

1213
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:26,400
generous have been laid the basis for an

1214
00:49:24,599 --> 00:49:29,369
articulated morality has been put in

1215
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:31,770
place the productive truthful sharer is

1216
00:49:29,369 --> 00:49:34,470
the prototype for the good citizen and

1217
00:49:31,770 --> 00:49:37,260
the good man we can see in this manner

1218
00:49:34,470 --> 00:49:40,200
how from the simple notion that

1219
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:44,280
leftovers are a good idea the highest

1220
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:46,800
moral principles might emerge it's as if

1221
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:53,130
something like this happened as humanity

1222
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:54,780
developed first were the endless tens or

1223
00:49:53,130 --> 00:49:56,550
hundreds of thousands of years prior to

1224
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:59,579
the emergence of written history and

1225
00:49:56,550 --> 00:50:02,220
drama during this time the twin

1226
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:06,000
practices of delay and exchange began to

1227
00:50:02,220 --> 00:50:07,770
emerge slowly and painfully then they

1228
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:10,500
became represented in metaphorical

1229
00:50:07,770 --> 00:50:14,089
abstraction as rituals and tales of

1230
00:50:10,500 --> 00:50:18,060
sacrifice told in a manner such as this

1231
00:50:14,089 --> 00:50:22,400
it's as if there's a powerful figure in

1232
00:50:18,060 --> 00:50:25,319
the sky who sees all and is judging you

1233
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:27,300
giving up something you value seems to

1234
00:50:25,319 --> 00:50:29,940
make them happy and you want to make

1235
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:34,109
them happy because all hell breaks loose

1236
00:50:29,940 --> 00:50:37,319
if you don't so practice sacrificing and

1237
00:50:34,109 --> 00:50:40,550
sharing until you become expert at it

1238
00:50:37,319 --> 00:50:43,290
and things will go well for you

1239
00:50:40,550 --> 00:50:45,180
no one said any of this at least not so

1240
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:46,950
plainly and directly but it was implicit

1241
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:51,690
in the practice and then in the stories

1242
00:50:46,950 --> 00:50:54,210
action came first as it had to as the

1243
00:50:51,690 --> 00:50:57,690
animals we once were could act but could

1244
00:50:54,210 --> 00:51:01,050
not think implicit unrecognized value

1245
00:50:57,690 --> 00:51:03,440
came first as the actions that preceded

1246
00:51:01,050 --> 00:51:03,440
thought

1247
00:51:03,710 --> 00:51:09,560
bodied value but did not make that value

1248
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:12,800
explicit people watched the successful

1249
00:51:09,560 --> 00:51:15,440
succeed and the unsuccessful fail for

1250
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:18,080
thousands and thousands of years we

1251
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:21,050
thought it over and we drew a conclusion

1252
00:51:18,080 --> 00:51:24,140
the successful among us delay

1253
00:51:21,050 --> 00:51:26,900
gratification the successful among us

1254
00:51:24,140 --> 00:51:28,880
bargained with the future a great idea

1255
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:31,520
began to emerge taking ever more clearly

1256
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:34,790
articulated form and ever more clearly

1257
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:36,470
articulated stories what's the

1258
00:51:34,790 --> 00:51:39,500
difference between the successful and

1259
00:51:36,470 --> 00:51:42,560
the unsuccessful for the successful

1260
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:46,220
sacrifice things get better as the

1261
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:48,290
successful practice their sacrifices the

1262
00:51:46,220 --> 00:51:51,020
questions become increasingly precise

1263
00:51:48,290 --> 00:51:53,150
and simultaneously broader what's the

1264
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:56,060
greatest possible sacrifice for the

1265
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:57,710
greatest possible good and the answer

1266
00:51:56,060 --> 00:52:01,580
has become increasingly deeper and

1267
00:51:57,710 --> 00:52:03,530
profound the god of Western tradition

1268
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:05,720
like so many gods requires sacrifice

1269
00:52:03,530 --> 00:52:08,660
we've already examined why but sometimes

1270
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:11,630
he goes even further he demands not only

1271
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:14,510
sacrifice but the sacrifice of precisely

1272
00:52:11,630 --> 00:52:17,030
what is loved best this is most starkly

1273
00:52:14,510 --> 00:52:20,050
portrayed and most confusingly evident

1274
00:52:17,030 --> 00:52:22,670
in the story of Abraham and Isaac

1275
00:52:20,050 --> 00:52:24,800
Abraham beloved of God long wanted the

1276
00:52:22,670 --> 00:52:26,720
son and God promised him exactly that

1277
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:28,970
after many delays and under the

1278
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:34,250
imperative possible conditions of old

1279
00:52:28,970 --> 00:52:36,589
age and a long barren wife but not so

1280
00:52:34,250 --> 00:52:39,500
long afterward when the miraculously

1281
00:52:36,589 --> 00:52:41,359
born Isaac is still a child God turns

1282
00:52:39,500 --> 00:52:43,550
around and in apparently barbaric

1283
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:45,740
fashion demands that his faithful

1284
00:52:43,550 --> 00:52:49,460
servant offer his son as a sacrifice

1285
00:52:45,740 --> 00:52:52,250
the story ends happily God sends an

1286
00:52:49,460 --> 00:52:55,280
angel to stay Abraham's obedient hand

1287
00:52:52,250 --> 00:52:57,980
and accepts a ram and Isaac stead that's

1288
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:59,119
a good thing it doesn't really address

1289
00:52:57,980 --> 00:53:01,790
the issue at hand

1290
00:52:59,119 --> 00:53:06,589
why was God's going further necessary

1291
00:53:01,790 --> 00:53:09,040
why does he why his life impose such

1292
00:53:06,589 --> 00:53:09,040
demands

1293
00:53:11,670 --> 00:53:20,480
we'll start our analysis with the truism

1294
00:53:14,810 --> 00:53:24,020
stark self-evident and understated

1295
00:53:20,480 --> 00:53:26,580
sometimes things do not go well that

1296
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:28,320
seems to have much to do with the

1297
00:53:26,580 --> 00:53:29,940
terrible nature of the world with its

1298
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:32,160
plagues and its famines and its

1299
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:33,050
tyrannies and its betrayals but here's

1300
00:53:32,160 --> 00:53:35,160
the rub

1301
00:53:33,050 --> 00:53:36,750
sometimes when things are not going well

1302
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:39,720
it's not the world that it's the cause

1303
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:44,610
the cause is instead that which is most

1304
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:46,260
valued why because the world is revealed

1305
00:53:44,610 --> 00:53:48,840
to an in terment degree through the

1306
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:52,140
template of your values if the world you

1307
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:54,930
are seeing is not the world you want

1308
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:58,380
therefore it's time to examine your

1309
00:53:54,930 --> 00:54:01,260
values it's time to rid yourself of your

1310
00:53:58,380 --> 00:54:04,470
current presuppositions it's time to let

1311
00:54:01,260 --> 00:54:07,290
go it might even be time to sacrifice

1312
00:54:04,470 --> 00:54:11,520
what you love best so that you can

1313
00:54:07,290 --> 00:54:17,010
become who you might become instead of

1314
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:19,590
staying who you are something valuable

1315
00:54:17,010 --> 00:54:22,530
given up ensures fused future prosperity

1316
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:25,800
something valuable sacrifice pleases the

1317
00:54:22,530 --> 00:54:28,230
Lord what is most valuable and best

1318
00:54:25,800 --> 00:54:30,660
sacrificed or what is at least

1319
00:54:28,230 --> 00:54:34,230
emblematic of that a choice cut of meat

1320
00:54:30,660 --> 00:54:38,420
the best animal in a flock a most valued

1321
00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:41,100
possession what's above even not

1322
00:54:38,420 --> 00:54:43,380
something intensely personal and painful

1323
00:54:41,100 --> 00:54:46,110
to give up that symbolized perhaps in

1324
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:48,420
God's insistence on circumcision as part

1325
00:54:46,110 --> 00:54:51,660
of Abraham sacrificial routine what's

1326
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:53,670
beyond that what pertains more closely

1327
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:55,590
to the whole person rather than the part

1328
00:54:53,670 --> 00:55:00,990
what constitutes the ultimate sacrifice

1329
00:54:55,590 --> 00:55:05,640
for the gain of the ultimate prize it's

1330
00:55:00,990 --> 00:55:08,430
a close race between child and self the

1331
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:11,040
sacrifice of the mother offered her

1332
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:12,840
child to the world is exemplified for

1333
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:16,290
example by Michelangelo's great

1334
00:55:12,840 --> 00:55:18,750
sculpture the Pieta Michelangelo crafted

1335
00:55:16,290 --> 00:55:21,090
Mary contemplating her son crucified in

1336
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:24,120
ruins so she's sitting most of you know

1337
00:55:21,090 --> 00:55:25,590
the sculpture she's sitting and the body

1338
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:27,990
of her son is in her arms

1339
00:55:25,590 --> 00:55:30,960
adults on and it's broken and he's been

1340
00:55:27,990 --> 00:55:35,190
destroyed and it's a very beautiful but

1341
00:55:30,960 --> 00:55:38,570
very tragic work of genius work of

1342
00:55:35,190 --> 00:55:41,100
genius level representation

1343
00:55:38,570 --> 00:55:43,470
Michelangelo crafted Mary contemplating

1344
00:55:41,100 --> 00:55:46,830
her son crucified and rude it's her

1345
00:55:43,470 --> 00:55:48,540
fault it was through her that he entered

1346
00:55:46,830 --> 00:55:51,810
the world and it's great drama of being

1347
00:55:48,540 --> 00:55:54,660
is it right to bring a baby into this

1348
00:55:51,810 --> 00:55:57,660
terrible world every woman asks herself

1349
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:59,760
that question some say no they have

1350
00:55:57,660 --> 00:56:01,800
their reasons Mary answers yes

1351
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:04,170
voluntarily knowing full well what's to

1352
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:06,420
come as do all mothers if they allow

1353
00:56:04,170 --> 00:56:08,820
themselves to see it's an act of supreme

1354
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:12,690
courage when it's undertaken voluntarily

1355
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:15,330
in turn Mary's son Christ offers himself

1356
00:56:12,690 --> 00:56:18,090
to God and the world to betrayal torture

1357
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:20,010
and death to the very point of despair

1358
00:56:18,090 --> 00:56:24,180
on the cross where he cries out those

1359
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:28,200
terrible words my God my God why hast

1360
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:30,060
thou forsaken me that is the archetypal

1361
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:32,490
story of the man who gives his all for

1362
00:56:30,060 --> 00:56:35,160
the sake of the better who offers up his

1363
00:56:32,490 --> 00:56:37,080
life for the advancement of being who

1364
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:39,510
allows God's will to become manifest

1365
00:56:37,080 --> 00:56:41,700
fully within the confines of a single

1366
00:56:39,510 --> 00:56:45,270
mortal life that is the model for the

1367
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:49,080
Honorable man in Christ case however as

1368
00:56:45,270 --> 00:56:53,310
he sacrifices himself God his father is

1369
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:54,840
simultaneously sacrificing his son it's

1370
00:56:53,310 --> 00:56:57,480
for this reason that the Christian

1371
00:56:54,840 --> 00:57:00,150
sacrificial drama of son and self is

1372
00:56:57,480 --> 00:57:02,730
archetypal it's a story at the limit

1373
00:57:00,150 --> 00:57:04,920
where nothing more extreme nothing

1374
00:57:02,730 --> 00:57:07,230
greater can be imagined that's the very

1375
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:10,620
definition of archetypal that's the core

1376
00:57:07,230 --> 00:57:14,280
of what constitutes religious pain and

1377
00:57:10,620 --> 00:57:18,720
suffering define the world of that there

1378
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:21,450
can be no doubt sacrifice can hold pain

1379
00:57:18,720 --> 00:57:25,200
and suffering in abeyance to a greater

1380
00:57:21,450 --> 00:57:27,480
or lesser degree and greater sacrifices

1381
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:30,300
can do that more effectively than lesser

1382
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:32,460
of that two there can be no doubt

1383
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:36,660
everyone holds this knowledge in their

1384
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:39,940
soul thus the person who wishes to

1385
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:42,850
alleviate suffering who wishes to

1386
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:44,140
defy the flaws in being who wishes to

1387
00:57:42,850 --> 00:57:47,260
bring about the best of all possible

1388
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:49,300
futures who wants to create heaven on

1389
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:51,850
earth will make the greatest of

1390
00:57:49,300 --> 00:57:54,700
sacrifices of self and child of

1391
00:57:51,850 --> 00:57:57,910
everything that is loved to live a life

1392
00:57:54,700 --> 00:58:01,420
am dat the good he will forego

1393
00:57:57,910 --> 00:58:04,840
expediency he will pursue the path of

1394
00:58:01,420 --> 00:58:07,800
ultimate meaning and he will in that

1395
00:58:04,840 --> 00:58:29,680
manner bring salvation to the ever

1396
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:32,170
desperate world on the third day Abraham

1397
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:38,110
lifted up his eyes and saw the place far

1398
00:58:32,170 --> 00:58:40,450
off it's not an accident also that it's

1399
00:58:38,110 --> 00:58:41,710
in a mountain right because a mountain

1400
00:58:40,450 --> 00:58:43,390
is something you have to climb and you

1401
00:58:41,710 --> 00:58:45,580
have to climb to the pinnacle of a

1402
00:58:43,390 --> 00:58:47,080
mountain and the mountain is upright and

1403
00:58:45,580 --> 00:58:49,600
the mountain stretches up to heaven and

1404
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:52,570
it's a long journey to specify the right

1405
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:54,940
place on the highest pinnacle and and

1406
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:56,920
that's symbolic because of course it's a

1407
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:58,210
pinnacle that you're always trying to

1408
00:58:56,920 --> 00:59:00,010
reach just like you're always trying to

1409
00:58:58,210 --> 00:59:02,560
aim you're always trying to climb upward

1410
00:59:00,010 --> 00:59:03,850
at least that's the theory depends to

1411
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:07,750
some degree of course on your definition

1412
00:59:03,850 --> 00:59:10,420
of upward and Abraham said to his young

1413
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:12,160
men abide here with the ass and I and

1414
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:15,670
the lad will go yonder and worship and

1415
00:59:12,160 --> 00:59:18,070
come to you again and Abraham took the

1416
00:59:15,670 --> 00:59:20,770
wood of the burnt offering and laid it

1417
00:59:18,070 --> 00:59:25,090
upon Isaac his son and he took the fire

1418
00:59:20,770 --> 00:59:30,160
in his hand and a knife and they went

1419
00:59:25,090 --> 00:59:32,050
both of them together and Isaac spake

1420
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:38,710
unto Abraham his father and said My

1421
00:59:32,050 --> 00:59:44,350
father and he said here am I my son and

1422
00:59:38,710 --> 00:59:47,580
he said Behold the fire in the wood but

1423
00:59:44,350 --> 00:59:50,920
where is the lamb for a burnt offering

1424
00:59:47,580 --> 00:59:53,350
and Abraham said my son God will provide

1425
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:57,860
himself a lamb for a burnt offering

1426
00:59:53,350 --> 00:59:59,150
so they went both of them together and

1427
00:59:57,860 --> 01:00:01,160
they came to the place which God had

1428
00:59:59,150 --> 01:00:03,230
told him of and Abraham built an altar

1429
01:00:01,160 --> 01:00:05,900
there and laid the wood in order and

1430
01:00:03,230 --> 01:00:11,360
bound Isaac his son and laid him on the

1431
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:12,860
altar upon the wood and Abraham

1432
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:20,780
stretched forth his hand and took the

1433
01:00:12,860 --> 01:00:23,000
knife to slay his son and the angel of

1434
01:00:20,780 --> 01:00:28,480
the Lord called unto him out of heaven

1435
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:31,610
and said Abraham and he said here am I

1436
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:33,380
an angel said lay not thine hand upon

1437
01:00:31,610 --> 01:00:35,690
the lad neither do thou anything unto

1438
01:00:33,380 --> 01:00:38,840
him for now I know that thou fearest God

1439
01:00:35,690 --> 01:00:42,010
seeing thou hast not withheld thy son an

1440
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:42,010
only son from me

1441
01:00:49,130 --> 01:00:53,880
when I was answering the questions last

1442
01:00:51,660 --> 01:00:55,859
night at this Q&A this guy asked me this

1443
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:59,819
question he said that he had parents who

1444
01:00:55,859 --> 01:01:06,029
were desperate anti-social alcoholic

1445
01:00:59,819 --> 01:01:08,609
addicted friendless and that they didn't

1446
01:01:06,029 --> 01:01:13,410
want him to leave their home he was the

1447
01:01:08,609 --> 01:01:16,559
only relationship they had but that was

1448
01:01:13,410 --> 01:01:20,670
of he was the only relationship they had

1449
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:24,509
and he asked what he should do and I

1450
01:01:20,670 --> 01:01:30,450
told him that he should leave and the

1451
01:01:24,509 --> 01:01:34,499
reason for that is that you have a moral

1452
01:01:30,450 --> 01:01:37,099
obligation as a parent to encourage your

1453
01:01:34,499 --> 01:01:41,999
child to go out into the world right and

1454
01:01:37,099 --> 01:01:45,720
to be whoever they can be to be the best

1455
01:01:41,999 --> 01:01:48,059
they can possibly be and in doing that

1456
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:51,539
you're offering you're encouraging them

1457
01:01:48,059 --> 01:01:55,170
to pursue the good you're sacrificing

1458
01:01:51,539 --> 01:01:58,470
them to the good you're not keeping them

1459
01:01:55,170 --> 01:02:00,329
for yourself selfishly you're telling

1460
01:01:58,470 --> 01:02:06,029
them that they can go out and live their

1461
01:02:00,329 --> 01:02:08,970
life and live it properly and and that's

1462
01:02:06,029 --> 01:02:13,789
the parallel to the idea of the

1463
01:02:08,970 --> 01:02:13,789
sacrifice of Isaac as far as I can tell

1464
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:21,569
you don't want for your son what it is

1465
01:02:18,089 --> 01:02:25,529
that you want for him you want for your

1466
01:02:21,569 --> 01:02:30,329
son what would be best for him and for

1467
01:02:25,529 --> 01:02:32,849
the world and you let go in precise

1468
01:02:30,329 --> 01:02:34,950
proportion to your desire to have that

1469
01:02:32,849 --> 01:02:36,420
happen you know the psychoanalyst the

1470
01:02:34,950 --> 01:02:37,829
great psychoanalyst I say the

1471
01:02:36,420 --> 01:02:39,660
psychoanalyst I think this is actually

1472
01:02:37,829 --> 01:02:42,440
Freud's dictum but I'm not certain of

1473
01:02:39,660 --> 01:02:45,239
that he said the good mother fails

1474
01:02:42,440 --> 01:02:49,559
which is a bit a brilliant observation

1475
01:02:45,239 --> 01:02:51,119
because when you have an infant do you

1476
01:02:49,559 --> 01:02:52,920
do everything for the infant because the

1477
01:02:51,119 --> 01:02:55,950
infant can do nothing for him or herself

1478
01:02:52,920 --> 01:02:59,339
but as the infant matures and is

1479
01:02:55,950 --> 01:03:01,259
increasingly capable of doing things for

1480
01:02:59,339 --> 01:03:02,090
him or herself then you pull back right

1481
01:03:01,259 --> 01:03:04,700
you pull

1482
01:03:02,090 --> 01:03:06,230
back and everytime the child develops

1483
01:03:04,700 --> 01:03:08,750
the ability to do something you allow

1484
01:03:06,230 --> 01:03:10,790
them or encourage them to do it and you

1485
01:03:08,750 --> 01:03:12,350
don't interfere you know so if your

1486
01:03:10,790 --> 01:03:14,150
child is struggling getting dressed well

1487
01:03:12,350 --> 01:03:15,920
obviously there's some times that you

1488
01:03:14,150 --> 01:03:17,870
help them but mostly you let them learn

1489
01:03:15,920 --> 01:03:19,790
so that they can know how to do it in

1490
01:03:17,870 --> 01:03:21,320
the future that's better for you and

1491
01:03:19,790 --> 01:03:23,240
it's certainly better for them there's a

1492
01:03:21,320 --> 01:03:24,590
rule if you're working with the elderly

1493
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:27,320
in an old-age home and the rule is

1494
01:03:24,590 --> 01:03:31,370
something like don't do anything for any

1495
01:03:27,320 --> 01:03:33,980
of the for any of the guests let's say

1496
01:03:31,370 --> 01:03:36,200
that they can do for themselves because

1497
01:03:33,980 --> 01:03:38,270
you compromise their independence and so

1498
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:40,400
as a mother you pull back and you pull

1499
01:03:38,270 --> 01:03:42,800
back and you let your child hit him or

1500
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:45,320
herself against the world and you fail

1501
01:03:42,800 --> 01:03:48,590
to protect them but by failing to

1502
01:03:45,320 --> 01:03:51,050
protect them you encourage and ennoble

1503
01:03:48,590 --> 01:03:54,050
them to the point where you're no longer

1504
01:03:51,050 --> 01:03:55,520
necessary now they may still want to see

1505
01:03:54,050 --> 01:03:57,350
you and it would be wonderful if that

1506
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:59,540
was the case but the point is is that

1507
01:03:57,350 --> 01:04:02,570
you're supposed to remove yourself from

1508
01:03:59,540 --> 01:04:05,090
the equation by encouraging your child

1509
01:04:02,570 --> 01:04:08,720
to be the best possible person that

1510
01:04:05,090 --> 01:04:12,470
person can be and you sacrifice your

1511
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:14,300
desires all of your desires to that your

1512
01:04:12,470 --> 01:04:16,000
personal desires even your desires for

1513
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:18,020
your child in relationship to you

1514
01:04:16,000 --> 01:04:20,480
because you want them to move forward

1515
01:04:18,020 --> 01:04:22,640
into the world as a light right as a

1516
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:25,550
light on a hill that's what you want if

1517
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:27,110
you have any sense and so you don't get

1518
01:04:25,550 --> 01:04:30,050
to keep your children at home because

1519
01:04:27,110 --> 01:04:32,060
you need them now I'm talking generally

1520
01:04:30,050 --> 01:04:33,920
obviously and there are circumstances

1521
01:04:32,060 --> 01:04:36,080
under which families make their own

1522
01:04:33,920 --> 01:04:38,570
idiosyncratic decisions and I'm not

1523
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:41,660
trying to dam everyone with a with a

1524
01:04:38,570 --> 01:04:46,490
casual gesture you know but the point is

1525
01:04:41,660 --> 01:04:48,290
still strong that the good father is

1526
01:04:46,490 --> 01:04:51,280
precisely someone who is willing to

1527
01:04:48,290 --> 01:04:54,290
sacrifice his child to the ultimate good

1528
01:04:51,280 --> 01:05:00,920
that's dramatized in this story you know

1529
01:04:54,290 --> 01:05:02,900
and it's brutal but the world is a

1530
01:05:00,920 --> 01:05:05,540
brutal place and much wisdom comes out

1531
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:07,760
of catastrophe and this is an indication

1532
01:05:05,540 --> 01:05:10,790
of how much catastrophe our ancestors

1533
01:05:07,760 --> 01:05:13,190
had to plow through had to work through

1534
01:05:10,790 --> 01:05:15,200
in order to generate the sub structure

1535
01:05:13,190 --> 01:05:15,710
for the conceptions of freedom even that

1536
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:17,900
we have to

1537
01:05:15,710 --> 01:05:20,420
they for freedom and the good and that's

1538
01:05:17,900 --> 01:05:22,310
how the story appears to me now I think

1539
01:05:20,420 --> 01:05:26,450
there's more to it I think if there has

1540
01:05:22,310 --> 01:05:28,310
to be more to it it lays the groundwork

1541
01:05:26,450 --> 01:05:30,410
at least in the Christian context for

1542
01:05:28,310 --> 01:05:34,190
the eventual emergence of Christ as I

1543
01:05:30,410 --> 01:05:35,839
alluded to in my reading that story

1544
01:05:34,190 --> 01:05:37,490
obviously has to be unpacked and

1545
01:05:35,839 --> 01:05:38,810
unpacked and unpacked just like it has

1546
01:05:37,490 --> 01:05:45,980
been for the last two thousand years

1547
01:05:38,810 --> 01:05:48,020
it's also an indication here of well I

1548
01:05:45,980 --> 01:05:50,030
would say the transmutation of sacrifice

1549
01:05:48,020 --> 01:05:51,589
into an increasingly psychological form

1550
01:05:50,030 --> 01:05:53,030
which is a development that we've

1551
01:05:51,589 --> 01:05:55,570
tracked all the way through the Old

1552
01:05:53,030 --> 01:05:59,089
Testament up to this particular point

1553
01:05:55,570 --> 01:06:00,619
first acted out then represented in

1554
01:05:59,089 --> 01:06:03,500
ritual those would be the rituals of

1555
01:06:00,619 --> 01:06:06,080
sacrifice then laid out in story then

1556
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:08,800
turned into a psychological phenomena so

1557
01:06:06,080 --> 01:06:12,580
that now we're capable of making

1558
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:15,290
sacrifices in abstraction right to

1559
01:06:12,580 --> 01:06:17,150
conceptualize a future that we want to

1560
01:06:15,290 --> 01:06:19,310
let go of the things that are stopping

1561
01:06:17,150 --> 01:06:20,839
us from moving forward and to free

1562
01:06:19,310 --> 01:06:23,540
ourselves from the chains of our

1563
01:06:20,839 --> 01:06:27,200
original preconceptions and that's laid

1564
01:06:23,540 --> 01:06:29,750
out in these old stories as the optimal

1565
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:32,030
path way of being and there's a

1566
01:06:29,750 --> 01:06:34,400
philosopher of science named Karl Popper

1567
01:06:32,030 --> 01:06:36,830
very sensible and down-to-earth person

1568
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:38,720
who was talking about thinking and its

1569
01:06:36,830 --> 01:06:40,760
nature and he was thought about thinking

1570
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:42,109
in a Darwinian fashion he said the

1571
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:44,990
purpose of thinking is to let your

1572
01:06:42,109 --> 01:06:47,660
thoughts die instead of you it's a

1573
01:06:44,990 --> 01:06:51,589
brilliant notion and so the idea is

1574
01:06:47,660 --> 01:06:53,480
something like you can conjure up a

1575
01:06:51,589 --> 01:06:55,160
representation of yourself you can

1576
01:06:53,480 --> 01:06:57,260
conjure up a variety of potential

1577
01:06:55,160 --> 01:07:00,140
representations of yourself in the

1578
01:06:57,260 --> 01:07:02,480
future you can lay out how those future

1579
01:07:00,140 --> 01:07:05,720
representations of yourself are likely

1580
01:07:02,480 --> 01:07:07,880
to prevail or fail you can call the

1581
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:09,859
potential use in the future that will

1582
01:07:07,880 --> 01:07:13,810
fail and then you can embody the ones

1583
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:16,220
that will succeed you do that well

1584
01:07:13,810 --> 01:07:18,190
simultaneously conjuring up a

1585
01:07:16,220 --> 01:07:21,230
representation of your current state and

1586
01:07:18,190 --> 01:07:23,839
determining for yourself because of your

1587
01:07:21,230 --> 01:07:26,030
undue suffering which elements of your

1588
01:07:23,839 --> 01:07:27,380
pathetic being need to be given up so

1589
01:07:26,030 --> 01:07:28,800
that you can move forward into that

1590
01:07:27,380 --> 01:07:31,230
future

1591
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:32,730
and the goal what is it that you're

1592
01:07:31,230 --> 01:07:34,470
aiming at with that work and not

1593
01:07:32,730 --> 01:07:35,790
sacrifice that's the ultimate question

1594
01:07:34,470 --> 01:07:37,320
it's the question I was trying to

1595
01:07:35,790 --> 01:07:38,730
address in that writing what is it that

1596
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:41,490
you're trying to do when you're trying

1597
01:07:38,730 --> 01:07:43,170
to improve the future we believe that

1598
01:07:41,490 --> 01:07:45,150
the future can be improved we believe

1599
01:07:43,170 --> 01:07:47,520
that it can be improved as a consequence

1600
01:07:45,150 --> 01:07:49,500
of our sacrificial work and so once

1601
01:07:47,520 --> 01:07:50,520
again what are the limitations what are

1602
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:52,200
the limits to that what are the

1603
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:53,790
necessary limits to that I would say we

1604
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:55,620
don't know I would say as well that

1605
01:07:53,790 --> 01:07:57,450
that's actually something that the

1606
01:07:55,620 --> 01:07:59,700
entire corpus of biblical stories is

1607
01:07:57,450 --> 01:08:03,450
trying desperately to articulate to

1608
01:07:59,700 --> 01:08:05,550
figure out and articulate right we we

1609
01:08:03,450 --> 01:08:07,980
conjured up this remarkable idea the

1610
01:08:05,550 --> 01:08:10,290
future exists we can see it even though

1611
01:08:07,980 --> 01:08:12,240
it's only potential we can adjust our

1612
01:08:10,290 --> 01:08:14,340
behavior in the present in order to

1613
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:14,820
maximize our probability of success in

1614
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:18,660
the future

1615
01:08:14,820 --> 01:08:23,280
how best to do that well the idea is

1616
01:08:18,660 --> 01:08:27,780
something like don't hesitate to offer

1617
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:31,080
the ultimate sacrifice if you want the

1618
01:08:27,780 --> 01:08:34,770
future to turn out ultimately well now

1619
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:37,470
obviously that idea is closed in

1620
01:08:34,770 --> 01:08:39,390
metaphysical speculation and religious

1621
01:08:37,470 --> 01:08:45,720
imagery but it still remains an

1622
01:08:39,390 --> 01:08:50,609
intensely practical issue right what is

1623
01:08:45,720 --> 01:08:53,400
it that you could contract for let's say

1624
01:08:50,609 --> 01:08:54,990
if you were willing to give up

1625
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:57,680
everything about you that's weak and

1626
01:08:54,990 --> 01:08:57,680
unworthy

1627
01:09:03,059 --> 01:09:12,329
the there's a there's a continual hints

1628
01:09:10,829 --> 01:09:13,920
of that in the Old Testament right

1629
01:09:12,329 --> 01:09:17,909
because what happens with Noah

1630
01:09:13,920 --> 01:09:20,880
of course is that he establishes the

1631
01:09:17,909 --> 01:09:23,279
proper covenant with God the proper

1632
01:09:20,880 --> 01:09:25,380
contract with being let's say and

1633
01:09:23,279 --> 01:09:27,119
thrives as a consequence and the

1634
01:09:25,380 --> 01:09:29,009
neighborhood does the same thing there's

1635
01:09:27,119 --> 01:09:31,440
a strong intimation that that's how the

1636
01:09:29,009 --> 01:09:34,139
world is set right now that idea

1637
01:09:31,440 --> 01:09:39,539
develops and magnifies as the stories

1638
01:09:34,139 --> 01:09:41,369
progress into something like into

1639
01:09:39,539 --> 01:09:47,029
something like the concept of heaven on

1640
01:09:41,369 --> 01:09:51,109
earth the notion being that the proper

1641
01:09:47,029 --> 01:09:54,719
sacrificial attitude produces a

1642
01:09:51,109 --> 01:09:56,699
psychological state and then the social

1643
01:09:54,719 --> 01:10:01,110
state that's a manifestation of that

1644
01:09:56,699 --> 01:10:03,829
attitude that decreases the probability

1645
01:10:01,110 --> 01:10:06,599
that the world will Carine into hell and

1646
01:10:03,829 --> 01:10:09,750
increases the probability that people

1647
01:10:06,599 --> 01:10:12,449
will live high-quality meaningful

1648
01:10:09,750 --> 01:10:14,760
private lives in a society that's

1649
01:10:12,449 --> 01:10:19,190
balanced and capable of supporting that

1650
01:10:14,760 --> 01:10:19,190
and none of that seems to me to be

1651
01:10:19,309 --> 01:10:24,960
questionable really I also don't think

1652
01:10:23,280 --> 01:10:28,139
it's anything that people don't actually

1653
01:10:24,960 --> 01:10:31,550
know you know people have told me many

1654
01:10:28,139 --> 01:10:33,630
times that when they listen to me talk

1655
01:10:31,550 --> 01:10:35,730
they are hearing things that they

1656
01:10:33,630 --> 01:10:37,829
already know knew but didn't know how to

1657
01:10:35,730 --> 01:10:39,239
say it's something like that and this is

1658
01:10:37,829 --> 01:10:41,489
one of those things that I think is

1659
01:10:39,239 --> 01:10:43,320
exactly like that I mean I think it's at

1660
01:10:41,489 --> 01:10:44,849
the very core of our moral knowledge and

1661
01:10:43,320 --> 01:10:46,170
which is our behavioral knowledge and

1662
01:10:44,849 --> 01:10:46,889
our perceptual knowledge I mean let's

1663
01:10:46,170 --> 01:10:48,719
get this straight

1664
01:10:46,889 --> 01:10:50,309
moral knowledge is no trivial matter

1665
01:10:48,719 --> 01:10:52,050
it's knowledge about how it is that you

1666
01:10:50,309 --> 01:10:54,119
orient yourself in the world there's no

1667
01:10:52,050 --> 01:10:54,690
more profoundly necessary form of

1668
01:10:54,119 --> 01:10:56,699
knowledge

1669
01:10:54,690 --> 01:10:58,679
oh it's predicated on on something

1670
01:10:56,699 --> 01:11:00,449
that's exactly like this we know that we

1671
01:10:58,679 --> 01:11:02,610
have to make sacrifices we know that we

1672
01:11:00,449 --> 01:11:04,260
have to omit what's good so then why

1673
01:11:02,610 --> 01:11:05,849
isn't that we don't aim at what's best

1674
01:11:04,260 --> 01:11:07,440
and make the sacrifices that are

1675
01:11:05,849 --> 01:11:11,880
necessary in order to bring that into

1676
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:13,980
play I think it seems to me that in some

1677
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:15,329
sense that's self-evident the question

1678
01:11:13,980 --> 01:11:16,860
is why we don't do it but there's

1679
01:11:15,329 --> 01:11:18,480
answers to that too already in

1680
01:11:16,860 --> 01:11:21,570
material that we've covered life is hard

1681
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:24,449
and it hurts people it's ripe with

1682
01:11:21,570 --> 01:11:27,090
limitation and some of its arbitrary and

1683
01:11:24,449 --> 01:11:28,739
it's no wonder and some of its unjust

1684
01:11:27,090 --> 01:11:30,239
and some of it's worse some of its

1685
01:11:28,739 --> 01:11:31,800
malevolent which is even worse than

1686
01:11:30,239 --> 01:11:33,989
something I haven't talked about at all

1687
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:36,179
in this lecture it's not surprising that

1688
01:11:33,989 --> 01:11:38,550
that combination of vicissitude can turn

1689
01:11:36,179 --> 01:11:39,989
people against being but I think even

1690
01:11:38,550 --> 01:11:43,820
when that happens and even when people

1691
01:11:39,989 --> 01:11:47,190
have the kind of history that if they

1692
01:11:43,820 --> 01:11:50,460
revealed to you you would say well it's

1693
01:11:47,190 --> 01:11:52,290
no wonder you turned out that way the

1694
01:11:50,460 --> 01:11:54,300
people who turn out that way still know

1695
01:11:52,290 --> 01:11:56,400
that it's wrong they still know that

1696
01:11:54,300 --> 01:11:58,500
however deep their own suffering however

1697
01:11:56,400 --> 01:12:00,719
arbitrary their own suffering however

1698
01:11:58,500 --> 01:12:02,520
much that's caused by the malevolence of

1699
01:12:00,719 --> 01:12:05,400
others as well as the tragedy of

1700
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:07,590
existence that that does not in any way

1701
01:12:05,400 --> 01:12:11,690
justify their turning away from the good

1702
01:12:07,590 --> 01:12:15,150
and I believe everyone knows that I

1703
01:12:11,690 --> 01:12:17,040
believe that they know it implicitly

1704
01:12:15,150 --> 01:12:19,290
even if they don't allow themselves to

1705
01:12:17,040 --> 01:12:21,540
know it explicitly and I believe that if

1706
01:12:19,290 --> 01:12:23,520
they violate that idea then they violate

1707
01:12:21,540 --> 01:12:25,409
themselves and that they end up in

1708
01:12:23,520 --> 01:12:27,150
Kane's position which is the position of

1709
01:12:25,409 --> 01:12:33,840
the man who's been given a punishment

1710
01:12:27,150 --> 01:12:40,110
that is too great to bear an angel said

1711
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:43,090
[Applause]

1712
01:12:40,110 --> 01:12:46,030
lay not thine hand upon the loud now to

1713
01:12:43,090 --> 01:12:51,550
do without anything unto him for now I

1714
01:12:46,030 --> 01:12:54,330
know that thou fearest God seeing thou

1715
01:12:51,550 --> 01:12:55,720
hast not withheld thy son thine only son

1716
01:12:54,330 --> 01:12:58,090
from me

1717
01:12:55,720 --> 01:13:02,080
and Abraham lifted up his eyes and

1718
01:12:58,090 --> 01:13:04,750
looked and behold behind him a ram

1719
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:07,600
caught in a thicket by his thorns by his

1720
01:13:04,750 --> 01:13:09,970
horns and Abraham went and took the RAM

1721
01:13:07,600 --> 01:13:16,090
and offered him up for a burnt offering

1722
01:13:09,970 --> 01:13:19,110
instead of his son and Abraham called

1723
01:13:16,090 --> 01:13:22,810
the name of that place Jehovah Jireh as

1724
01:13:19,110 --> 01:13:28,180
it is said to this day in the mount of

1725
01:13:22,810 --> 01:13:29,950
the Lord it shall be seen and the angel

1726
01:13:28,180 --> 01:13:33,850
of the Lord called unto Abraham out of

1727
01:13:29,950 --> 01:13:36,280
heaven the second time and said by

1728
01:13:33,850 --> 01:13:38,110
myself have I sworn saith the Lord for

1729
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:42,670
because thou has done this thing and has

1730
01:13:38,110 --> 01:13:45,790
not withheld thy son thine only son that

1731
01:13:42,670 --> 01:13:48,610
in blessing I will bless thee and in

1732
01:13:45,790 --> 01:13:50,410
multiplying I will multiply thy seed as

1733
01:13:48,610 --> 01:13:53,110
the stars of the heaven and as the sand

1734
01:13:50,410 --> 01:13:55,000
which is upon the sea shore and thy seed

1735
01:13:53,110 --> 01:13:57,880
shall possess the gates of his gate of

1736
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:59,530
his enemies and in thy seed shall all

1737
01:13:57,880 --> 01:14:04,830
the nations of the earth be blessed

1738
01:13:59,530 --> 01:14:04,830
because thou hast obeyed my voice

1739
01:14:10,899 --> 01:14:14,860
so Abraham returned unto his young men

1740
01:14:13,239 --> 01:14:17,590
and they rose up and went together to

1741
01:14:14,860 --> 01:14:20,829
Beersheba and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba

1742
01:14:17,590 --> 01:14:25,449
and it came to pass after these things

1743
01:14:20,829 --> 01:14:26,110
that it was told Abraham saying he hold

1744
01:14:25,449 --> 01:14:27,879
Milka

1745
01:14:26,110 --> 01:14:31,719
she has also borne children unto thy

1746
01:14:27,879 --> 01:14:34,239
brother Nahor and Sarah was a hundred

1747
01:14:31,719 --> 01:14:35,889
and seven and twenty years old those

1748
01:14:34,239 --> 01:14:39,159
were the years of the life of Sarah and

1749
01:14:35,889 --> 01:14:41,649
Sarah died in quor'toth Arba the same as

1750
01:14:39,159 --> 01:14:47,099
Hebron in the land of Canaan and Abraham

1751
01:14:41,649 --> 01:14:47,099
came to mourn for Sarah and a weeper

1752
01:15:17,949 --> 01:15:24,600
well I don't exactly know what to do now

1753
01:15:24,719 --> 01:15:27,989
because that

1754
01:15:31,330 --> 01:15:45,100
[Applause]

1755
01:15:42,360 --> 01:15:48,160
I'll review what we've what we've

1756
01:15:45,100 --> 01:15:49,990
covered and then I'll bring this to a

1757
01:15:48,160 --> 01:15:57,370
close we can have some more questions

1758
01:15:49,990 --> 01:16:03,670
than would be usual tonight so what have

1759
01:15:57,370 --> 01:16:05,200
we established by this point the stories

1760
01:16:03,670 --> 01:16:10,000
that have been revealed so far are

1761
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:16,660
something like they contain the idea

1762
01:16:10,000 --> 01:16:19,410
that there's something divine that's

1763
01:16:16,660 --> 01:16:22,600
analogous to the human capacity for

1764
01:16:19,410 --> 01:16:26,170
communication and attention that's at

1765
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:30,970
the it operates at the genesis of being

1766
01:16:26,170 --> 01:16:34,600
itself that's the initial account in the

1767
01:16:30,970 --> 01:16:39,220
Old Testament it's an account that

1768
01:16:34,600 --> 01:16:43,990
places the role of Spirit centrally in

1769
01:16:39,220 --> 01:16:45,540
the in the nature of being now I'm not

1770
01:16:43,990 --> 01:16:47,440
exactly sure what to make of that

1771
01:16:45,540 --> 01:16:50,650
because in some ways I'm is

1772
01:16:47,440 --> 01:16:54,460
materialistically oriented as modern

1773
01:16:50,650 --> 01:16:58,210
people typically are but the stories

1774
01:16:54,460 --> 01:17:01,870
make sense to me in many ways the idea

1775
01:16:58,210 --> 01:17:04,750
that there's something world creating

1776
01:17:01,870 --> 01:17:07,420
about human consciousness and that

1777
01:17:04,750 --> 01:17:10,540
that's akin in some sense to the divine

1778
01:17:07,420 --> 01:17:11,620
force that called order out of chaos at

1779
01:17:10,540 --> 01:17:14,070
the beginning of time

1780
01:17:11,620 --> 01:17:16,990
seems to me to be a very powerful

1781
01:17:14,070 --> 01:17:20,440
metaphysical idea and it also seems to

1782
01:17:16,990 --> 01:17:23,220
me to be an idea that is immovable at

1783
01:17:20,440 --> 01:17:25,930
the foundation of Western culture

1784
01:17:23,220 --> 01:17:29,530
because our entire legal system our

1785
01:17:25,930 --> 01:17:33,520
society our expect mutual expectations

1786
01:17:29,530 --> 01:17:38,140
all of that are conditioned to the final

1787
01:17:33,520 --> 01:17:40,720
degree by our presupposition that each

1788
01:17:38,140 --> 01:17:43,420
of us has an intrinsic value that

1789
01:17:40,720 --> 01:17:47,800
transcends the local conditions of our

1790
01:17:43,420 --> 01:17:50,110
being and it's with that presupposition

1791
01:17:47,800 --> 01:17:50,949
that we've been able to establish the

1792
01:17:50,110 --> 01:17:53,679
society

1793
01:17:50,949 --> 01:17:55,719
that functions a society that functions

1794
01:17:53,679 --> 01:17:58,630
and functions well and it has its

1795
01:17:55,719 --> 01:18:02,260
current characterization and that's a

1796
01:17:58,630 --> 01:18:05,260
nun it's an unlikely occurrence and it's

1797
01:18:02,260 --> 01:18:09,130
a non-trivial reality and I don't see

1798
01:18:05,260 --> 01:18:10,719
any way out of that way out of that

1799
01:18:09,130 --> 01:18:15,340
conclusion I don't see anything that

1800
01:18:10,719 --> 01:18:19,749
that can easily be replaced with and so

1801
01:18:15,340 --> 01:18:21,249
god calls being into order into being

1802
01:18:19,749 --> 01:18:23,650
out of chaos at the beginning of time

1803
01:18:21,249 --> 01:18:25,659
and the tributes to human beings the

1804
01:18:23,650 --> 01:18:27,489
same essential capacity then we turn to

1805
01:18:25,659 --> 01:18:31,239
Adam and Eve in the garden and they're

1806
01:18:27,489 --> 01:18:33,190
unconscious by all appearances allied

1807
01:18:31,239 --> 01:18:34,630
tightly with God but unconscious they

1808
01:18:33,190 --> 01:18:36,309
don't seem aware of the future

1809
01:18:34,630 --> 01:18:37,209
they don't seem aware of themselves they

1810
01:18:36,309 --> 01:18:41,769
don't seem aware of their own

1811
01:18:37,209 --> 01:18:44,769
vulnerability they make the fatal error

1812
01:18:41,769 --> 01:18:46,780
of having their eyes open they discover

1813
01:18:44,769 --> 01:18:49,300
their own vulnerability they also

1814
01:18:46,780 --> 01:18:51,329
discover their capacity for evil we

1815
01:18:49,300 --> 01:18:53,889
reviewed that to some degree

1816
01:18:51,329 --> 01:18:56,639
what's the association because it's the

1817
01:18:53,889 --> 01:19:00,159
tree of the knowledge of good and evil

1818
01:18:56,639 --> 01:19:01,869
the fruit of which they eat what's the

1819
01:19:00,159 --> 01:19:03,969
association between the discovery of

1820
01:19:01,869 --> 01:19:06,639
vulnerability and the emergence of moral

1821
01:19:03,969 --> 01:19:09,070
knowledge it's something like as far as

1822
01:19:06,639 --> 01:19:11,469
I can tell that you actually don't know

1823
01:19:09,070 --> 01:19:13,389
how to be evil or to be good until

1824
01:19:11,469 --> 01:19:15,429
you're actually aware consciously of

1825
01:19:13,389 --> 01:19:17,650
your own vulnerability because the

1826
01:19:15,429 --> 01:19:20,199
essence of evil is the exploitation of

1827
01:19:17,650 --> 01:19:23,170
vulnerability perhaps for the sake of

1828
01:19:20,199 --> 01:19:26,349
that exploitation and I can't understand

1829
01:19:23,170 --> 01:19:29,949
how to hurt someone until I know exactly

1830
01:19:26,349 --> 01:19:31,499
how I can be hurt myself and I can't

1831
01:19:29,949 --> 01:19:34,360
understand how I can be hurt myself

1832
01:19:31,499 --> 01:19:36,130
until I become cognizant of my mortal

1833
01:19:34,360 --> 01:19:38,769
limitations until I understand what

1834
01:19:36,130 --> 01:19:40,809
brings me pain until I understand the

1835
01:19:38,769 --> 01:19:43,659
suffering that goes along with my mortal

1836
01:19:40,809 --> 01:19:45,239
limitations my my inevitable death and

1837
01:19:43,659 --> 01:19:49,090
the suffering that goes along with that

1838
01:19:45,239 --> 01:19:51,999
and with the with the accrual of the

1839
01:19:49,090 --> 01:19:53,469
knowledge of mortality and good and evil

1840
01:19:51,999 --> 01:19:56,139
Adam and Eve are cast out of paradise

1841
01:19:53,469 --> 01:19:58,510
and history begins and that seems right

1842
01:19:56,139 --> 01:20:00,219
to me because I don't think that history

1843
01:19:58,510 --> 01:20:01,150
did begin before human beings became

1844
01:20:00,219 --> 01:20:03,219
self conscious

1845
01:20:01,150 --> 01:20:04,320
so there's something about that that's

1846
01:20:03,219 --> 01:20:05,640
right if his

1847
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:07,710
three doesn't really begin until people

1848
01:20:05,640 --> 01:20:09,330
become aware of the future history

1849
01:20:07,710 --> 01:20:11,490
doesn't really begin until until people

1850
01:20:09,330 --> 01:20:13,980
work and start to build right we still

1851
01:20:11,490 --> 01:20:15,870
live we would still be ensconced in

1852
01:20:13,980 --> 01:20:18,600
essentially an animal existence until

1853
01:20:15,870 --> 01:20:20,670
we're aware of the future and start to

1854
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:22,290
buttress herself against it start to

1855
01:20:20,670 --> 01:20:25,560
wear clothing start to build buildings

1856
01:20:22,290 --> 01:20:27,330
start to make cities all in all in

1857
01:20:25,560 --> 01:20:29,430
consequence of having become aware of

1858
01:20:27,330 --> 01:20:31,560
the fact that we're fragile and that the

1859
01:20:29,430 --> 01:20:33,300
future is a dangerous place so that

1860
01:20:31,560 --> 01:20:34,980
seems to me to be existentially correct

1861
01:20:33,300 --> 01:20:37,350
and then we have the story of Cain and

1862
01:20:34,980 --> 01:20:38,760
Abel brilliantly placed immediately

1863
01:20:37,350 --> 01:20:41,610
afterwards and so those are the two

1864
01:20:38,760 --> 01:20:44,430
first two people in history essentially

1865
01:20:41,610 --> 01:20:46,020
and they make sacrifices so that goes

1866
01:20:44,430 --> 01:20:47,490
along with the idea of the discovery

1867
01:20:46,020 --> 01:20:50,400
worked and necessity of work and the

1868
01:20:47,490 --> 01:20:53,810
discovery of the future and then exactly

1869
01:20:50,400 --> 01:20:57,000
what you'd expect would happen one

1870
01:20:53,810 --> 01:20:59,310
segment of mankind let's say makes the

1871
01:20:57,000 --> 01:21:01,200
sacrifices properly and prevails in the

1872
01:20:59,310 --> 01:21:03,900
other segment makes the sacrifices

1873
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:05,940
improperly and fails and that's

1874
01:21:03,900 --> 01:21:07,410
perfectly reasonable given what you see

1875
01:21:05,940 --> 01:21:09,870
around you because that's what seems to

1876
01:21:07,410 --> 01:21:12,960
happen all the time and then more

1877
01:21:09,870 --> 01:21:15,000
interestingly I would say that the

1878
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:19,140
sacrificial failure produces

1879
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:23,790
embitterment right and that embedment

1880
01:21:19,140 --> 01:21:26,250
produces a hatred for being and a desire

1881
01:21:23,790 --> 01:21:28,320
for revenge that seems perfectly

1882
01:21:26,250 --> 01:21:31,260
appropriate when I look at people who

1883
01:21:28,320 --> 01:21:32,760
are bitter and who want revenge it's

1884
01:21:31,260 --> 01:21:35,250
generally because their sacrificial

1885
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:37,320
efforts have failed now I'm loathe to

1886
01:21:35,250 --> 01:21:39,750
say that that's a matter of their own

1887
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:47,100
doing although sometimes it clearly is

1888
01:21:39,750 --> 01:21:50,910
the embittered and vengeful complained

1889
01:21:47,100 --> 01:21:55,050
to God and blame him for the structure

1890
01:21:50,910 --> 01:21:57,980
of existence you know I read about the

1891
01:21:55,050 --> 01:22:02,010
Columbine massacre and the kids who

1892
01:21:57,980 --> 01:22:03,510
undertook it that'll make your hair

1893
01:22:02,010 --> 01:22:06,260
stand on end if you want to read

1894
01:22:03,510 --> 01:22:08,700
something that will really disturb you

1895
01:22:06,260 --> 01:22:10,290
reading Erich Harris's writings will

1896
01:22:08,700 --> 01:22:12,570
really disturb you no matter how much

1897
01:22:10,290 --> 01:22:14,940
you know about human beings reading

1898
01:22:12,570 --> 01:22:17,880
Erich Harris's writings will disturb you

1899
01:22:14,940 --> 01:22:20,730
and Harris's Kane you know

1900
01:22:17,880 --> 01:22:23,909
he says it straightforwardly he hates

1901
01:22:20,730 --> 01:22:25,739
human beings hates being itself he would

1902
01:22:23,909 --> 01:22:28,290
destroy everything if it was within his

1903
01:22:25,739 --> 01:22:31,920
power to do that and of course him and

1904
01:22:28,290 --> 01:22:33,690
his colleague were motivated to produce

1905
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:36,389
far more carnage than they managed that

1906
01:22:33,690 --> 01:22:38,449
day what was successful was only a

1907
01:22:36,389 --> 01:22:41,010
fraction of what they had planned and

1908
01:22:38,449 --> 01:22:42,840
and Harris said very straightforwardly

1909
01:22:41,010 --> 01:22:44,429
that he was that he had set himself up

1910
01:22:42,840 --> 01:22:47,580
as the judge of being and that it lacked

1911
01:22:44,429 --> 01:22:50,400
all utility in his eyes human beings

1912
01:22:47,580 --> 01:22:52,469
certainly should all be did all be

1913
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:55,560
removed from the face of existence

1914
01:22:52,469 --> 01:23:00,090
because of their pathology and the

1915
01:22:55,560 --> 01:23:01,440
fundamental horrors of being itself so

1916
01:23:00,090 --> 01:23:03,840
there's nothing in the Cain and Abel

1917
01:23:01,440 --> 01:23:05,760
story that isn't real it's real and Kane

1918
01:23:03,840 --> 01:23:08,190
complains to God as people will when

1919
01:23:05,760 --> 01:23:09,960
their dreams are dashed and then it's

1920
01:23:08,190 --> 01:23:12,900
goes for people who don't believe in God

1921
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:14,820
- it doesn't really matter you know it's

1922
01:23:12,900 --> 01:23:16,800
harder I suppose if you're atheistic to

1923
01:23:14,820 --> 01:23:20,699
figure out who to blame but that doesn't

1924
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:22,670
mean that the sentiment well it doesn't

1925
01:23:20,699 --> 01:23:25,469
mean that the sentiment is any different

1926
01:23:22,670 --> 01:23:27,600
right the same drama is being enacted

1927
01:23:25,469 --> 01:23:29,969
you shake your fist at the structure of

1928
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:32,100
being rather than at God himself but it

1929
01:23:29,969 --> 01:23:38,670
doesn't make any difference except in

1930
01:23:32,100 --> 01:23:41,280
the details so God responds to Cain and

1931
01:23:38,670 --> 01:23:42,960
tells him that he's got no right to

1932
01:23:41,280 --> 01:23:45,420
judge being before he gets his

1933
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:51,060
sacrificial house in order and even

1934
01:23:45,420 --> 01:23:54,440
worse he says that Cain is the architect

1935
01:23:51,060 --> 01:23:56,489
of his own downfall and the invited

1936
01:23:54,440 --> 01:23:59,790
catastrophe in his own house into his

1937
01:23:56,489 --> 01:24:01,800
own house willingly and entered into a

1938
01:23:59,790 --> 01:24:04,290
creative union with it and therefore

1939
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:06,000
brought about his own demise and it's

1940
01:24:04,290 --> 01:24:07,650
that additional self-knowledge and you

1941
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:09,960
can imagine to you know imagine that

1942
01:24:07,650 --> 01:24:11,460
you're in you're facing your life you're

1943
01:24:09,960 --> 01:24:13,350
facing the failures of your life and

1944
01:24:11,460 --> 01:24:16,620
let's say that you've had a failed life

1945
01:24:13,350 --> 01:24:19,170
and you're bitter about that and then

1946
01:24:16,620 --> 01:24:21,830
you meditate upon it and you think why

1947
01:24:19,170 --> 01:24:24,389
has this come about and then you think

1948
01:24:21,830 --> 01:24:26,489
well perhaps I did something wrong you

1949
01:24:24,389 --> 01:24:28,860
know when Alexander Solzhenitsyn wrote

1950
01:24:26,489 --> 01:24:31,170
The Gulag Archipelago which is the book

1951
01:24:28,860 --> 01:24:31,800
that detailed the catastrophes of the

1952
01:24:31,170 --> 01:24:35,460
Soviet you

1953
01:24:31,800 --> 01:24:37,770
and help bring it down it is one part of

1954
01:24:35,460 --> 01:24:40,290
that book that just struck me so so

1955
01:24:37,770 --> 01:24:42,630
viciously when I read it he he was in

1956
01:24:40,290 --> 01:24:46,470
the car in the GU leg and he was there

1957
01:24:42,630 --> 01:24:48,300
for a very long time and he said that he

1958
01:24:46,470 --> 01:24:50,130
observed a variety of people in the

1959
01:24:48,300 --> 01:24:50,670
camps who he really admired they were

1960
01:24:50,130 --> 01:24:52,410
rare

1961
01:24:50,670 --> 01:24:55,850
they were usually religious believers in

1962
01:24:52,410 --> 01:24:57,990
his in his experience who were not

1963
01:24:55,850 --> 01:25:01,770
participating in the pathology of the

1964
01:24:57,990 --> 01:25:03,030
camp's at all period no matter what he

1965
01:25:01,770 --> 01:25:04,350
said he learned a lot from watching

1966
01:25:03,030 --> 01:25:05,940
those people he had a hard time

1967
01:25:04,350 --> 01:25:07,740
believing that they even existed that

1968
01:25:05,940 --> 01:25:10,380
they could even exist but he said that

1969
01:25:07,740 --> 01:25:12,870
one of the things that he was brought to

1970
01:25:10,380 --> 01:25:16,830
as a consequence of watching those

1971
01:25:12,870 --> 01:25:18,810
people live their contract with goodness

1972
01:25:16,830 --> 01:25:22,020
out even under the most horrifying of

1973
01:25:18,810 --> 01:25:25,770
conditions was that it was possible that

1974
01:25:22,020 --> 01:25:27,920
he himself was responsible for his

1975
01:25:25,770 --> 01:25:30,960
position in the camp now it's a very

1976
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:33,300
dangerous line of argumentation you know

1977
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:35,310
because who wants to be the one who

1978
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:37,200
blames the victim for the catastrophe

1979
01:25:35,310 --> 01:25:38,880
you know you have to be very careful

1980
01:25:37,200 --> 01:25:40,410
when you walk down that road but

1981
01:25:38,880 --> 01:25:43,590
Solzhenitsyn was speaking about himself

1982
01:25:40,410 --> 01:25:48,720
and he said well he was a communist you

1983
01:25:43,590 --> 01:25:51,300
know and he arrogantly and forthrightly

1984
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:55,530
moved the movement out into the world

1985
01:25:51,300 --> 01:25:57,930
and had not fully gone over his life

1986
01:25:55,530 --> 01:26:00,540
with a fine-tooth comb to find out what

1987
01:25:57,930 --> 01:26:03,180
mistakes he had made that brought him so

1988
01:26:00,540 --> 01:26:05,220
low but his contention eventually was

1989
01:26:03,180 --> 01:26:08,010
that part of the reason that he ended up

1990
01:26:05,220 --> 01:26:10,740
where he ended up was because he and

1991
01:26:08,010 --> 01:26:12,090
many others had completely forfeited

1992
01:26:10,740 --> 01:26:14,240
their relationship with the truth and

1993
01:26:12,090 --> 01:26:17,520
allowed their society to degenerate into

1994
01:26:14,240 --> 01:26:21,120
deceit and tyrannical catastrophe

1995
01:26:17,520 --> 01:26:24,150
without mounting sufficient opposition

1996
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:27,630
and so he decided when he was in the

1997
01:26:24,150 --> 01:26:30,300
camps to straighten himself out bit by

1998
01:26:27,630 --> 01:26:32,220
bit and that culminated in the

1999
01:26:30,300 --> 01:26:35,700
production of the Gulag Archipelago in

2000
01:26:32,220 --> 01:26:38,130
that book really demolished once and for

2001
01:26:35,700 --> 01:26:40,260
all any moral credibility that the

2002
01:26:38,130 --> 01:26:43,760
communist totalitarian systems had left

2003
01:26:40,260 --> 01:26:44,910
and so one man in the depths of

2004
01:26:43,760 --> 01:26:45,540
catastrophe

2005
01:26:44,910 --> 01:26:47,490
who

2006
01:26:45,540 --> 01:26:50,390
and through good example at least in

2007
01:26:47,490 --> 01:26:54,180
part to stop lying produced a book

2008
01:26:50,390 --> 01:26:55,890
eventually the demolished the foundation

2009
01:26:54,180 --> 01:26:57,750
of the very system that had imprisoned

2010
01:26:55,890 --> 01:27:01,410
him and that is really worth thinking

2011
01:26:57,750 --> 01:27:04,290
about that's one example of the absolute

2012
01:27:01,410 --> 01:27:06,780
grandeur of the human soul and the

2013
01:27:04,290 --> 01:27:11,190
capacity for transformation that it has

2014
01:27:06,780 --> 01:27:12,960
when let loose properly on the world so

2015
01:27:11,190 --> 01:27:15,060
let's say you're conceptualizing your

2016
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:16,560
own failure you know and you meditated

2017
01:27:15,060 --> 01:27:19,170
on it and you come to the conclusion

2018
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:21,480
that God forced Cain to pay not only

2019
01:27:19,170 --> 01:27:24,840
have things not been going very well for

2020
01:27:21,480 --> 01:27:27,060
you but it's actually your fault and not

2021
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:29,370
only that you brought it on yourself and

2022
01:27:27,060 --> 01:27:31,050
not only that you knew it all the time

2023
01:27:29,370 --> 01:27:33,060
well then you might think you'll wake up

2024
01:27:31,050 --> 01:27:34,710
and fly right right you'll get your

2025
01:27:33,060 --> 01:27:36,180
wings in order and fly right but there's

2026
01:27:34,710 --> 01:27:38,490
no reason to assume that at all and

2027
01:27:36,180 --> 01:27:40,740
that's not what happens to Cain that

2028
01:27:38,490 --> 01:27:42,270
just makes him more bitter right and you

2029
01:27:40,740 --> 01:27:43,830
can understand that if you think about

2030
01:27:42,270 --> 01:27:45,240
it just for a second it's like bad

2031
01:27:43,830 --> 01:27:47,100
enough when something horrible happens

2032
01:27:45,240 --> 01:27:49,830
to you but then to have to swallow the

2033
01:27:47,100 --> 01:27:51,840
additional pill right have to take in

2034
01:27:49,830 --> 01:27:52,770
the information that you could have done

2035
01:27:51,840 --> 01:27:54,930
something different

2036
01:27:52,770 --> 01:27:56,850
it was avoidable and you knew it at the

2037
01:27:54,930 --> 01:27:58,770
time and you decided to do it anyways

2038
01:27:56,850 --> 01:28:00,990
and I think people are in that situation

2039
01:27:58,770 --> 01:28:02,970
a lot more often than ever anyone is

2040
01:28:00,990 --> 01:28:04,320
willing to admit you know you have that

2041
01:28:02,970 --> 01:28:09,600
little voice in the back of your head

2042
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:12,030
that says don't do it and you override

2043
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:13,230
it and you know it's arrogance that

2044
01:28:12,030 --> 01:28:15,270
makes you override it it's always

2045
01:28:13,230 --> 01:28:17,340
arrogance you know it always warns you

2046
01:28:15,270 --> 01:28:20,040
to always arrogance yeah I can get away

2047
01:28:17,340 --> 01:28:21,960
with it it's like no you can't I don't

2048
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:23,970
think you ever get away with anything

2049
01:28:21,960 --> 01:28:25,710
so and maybe your experience has taught

2050
01:28:23,970 --> 01:28:28,050
you different but my suspicions are it

2051
01:28:25,710 --> 01:28:32,060
hasn't and if you think it has well the

2052
01:28:28,050 --> 01:28:34,890
other shoe hasn't yet dropped so Cain

2053
01:28:32,060 --> 01:28:39,000
doesn't take the opportunity to let

2054
01:28:34,890 --> 01:28:41,760
God's wisdom reorient his character and

2055
01:28:39,000 --> 01:28:43,860
that that could have been outcome he

2056
01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:46,860
could have got down on his knees so to

2057
01:28:43,860 --> 01:28:48,390
speak and said oh my oh my god I've been

2058
01:28:46,860 --> 01:28:49,710
wrong all along I've been living

2059
01:28:48,390 --> 01:28:51,870
improperly I've been making the wrong

2060
01:28:49,710 --> 01:28:54,780
sacrifices Abel deserves everything he

2061
01:28:51,870 --> 01:28:57,150
has I got exactly what was coming to me

2062
01:28:54,780 --> 01:28:58,780
you know could I possibly now Street

2063
01:28:57,150 --> 01:29:01,870
myself out and and

2064
01:28:58,780 --> 01:29:03,640
and and and live in repentance and

2065
01:29:01,870 --> 01:29:06,100
improve my position but that's not what

2066
01:29:03,640 --> 01:29:09,730
he did at all he said all right fair

2067
01:29:06,100 --> 01:29:13,420
enough I get it it's like I'm going to

2068
01:29:09,730 --> 01:29:14,440
go after the thing I most admire and I'm

2069
01:29:13,420 --> 01:29:16,420
going to destroy it

2070
01:29:14,440 --> 01:29:18,760
and I'm going to do that despite its

2071
01:29:16,420 --> 01:29:22,390
cost to me and I'm going to do that just

2072
01:29:18,760 --> 01:29:25,840
to spite the creator of being that's

2073
01:29:22,390 --> 01:29:28,090
exactly what Paris did at Columbine it's

2074
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:31,540
exactly what he says in fact it is

2075
01:29:28,090 --> 01:29:33,040
uncanny writings it's why the mass

2076
01:29:31,540 --> 01:29:35,680
murderers always shoot themselves

2077
01:29:33,040 --> 01:29:37,900
afterwards not before because you might

2078
01:29:35,680 --> 01:29:39,370
wonder if you're so upset with the

2079
01:29:37,900 --> 01:29:41,140
structure of being why you don't just

2080
01:29:39,370 --> 01:29:43,150
commit suicide in your basement why do

2081
01:29:41,140 --> 01:29:45,730
you have to go out and mass murder

2082
01:29:43,150 --> 01:29:47,950
before you top it off with a gun to your

2083
01:29:45,730 --> 01:29:49,420
forehead well you don't make the point

2084
01:29:47,950 --> 01:29:52,060
as effectively if you just commit

2085
01:29:49,420 --> 01:29:54,190
suicide in your basement it's like well

2086
01:29:52,060 --> 01:29:56,890
I'm I life means nothing to me

2087
01:29:54,190 --> 01:29:58,300
but neither does anyone else's and

2088
01:29:56,890 --> 01:30:00,220
neither does the structure of being

2089
01:29:58,300 --> 01:30:02,410
itself and I'll take all my revenge as

2090
01:30:00,220 --> 01:30:04,720
much as I possibly can and then just to

2091
01:30:02,410 --> 01:30:07,390
show you how little I care I'll cap

2092
01:30:04,720 --> 01:30:10,480
myself off at the end and I would say

2093
01:30:07,390 --> 01:30:13,030
also people say all the time I don't

2094
01:30:10,480 --> 01:30:16,000
understand how that could happen it's

2095
01:30:13,030 --> 01:30:21,100
like I don't believe that I think an

2096
01:30:16,000 --> 01:30:23,020
hour of thought of real thought real

2097
01:30:21,100 --> 01:30:26,500
thought about your darkest feelings

2098
01:30:23,020 --> 01:30:28,270
about existence itself illuminates the

2099
01:30:26,500 --> 01:30:31,870
pathway to that sort of behavior quite

2100
01:30:28,270 --> 01:30:33,850
clearly I think if you I mean I might be

2101
01:30:31,870 --> 01:30:41,370
wrong I might be a darker person than

2102
01:30:33,850 --> 01:30:41,370
most and it's certainly okay okay

2103
01:30:44,889 --> 01:30:49,190
well at least I think there are plenty

2104
01:30:47,179 --> 01:30:50,900
of people out there who are sufficiently

2105
01:30:49,190 --> 01:30:52,429
dark to know exactly what I mean what

2106
01:30:50,900 --> 01:30:54,860
I'm saying these things and I would also

2107
01:30:52,429 --> 01:30:57,170
say that if it doesn't leap to your

2108
01:30:54,860 --> 01:30:59,239
understanding how that pathway might be

2109
01:30:57,170 --> 01:31:00,710
illuminated then you need to know a lot

2110
01:30:59,239 --> 01:31:03,500
more about yourself than you actually

2111
01:31:00,710 --> 01:31:05,480
know now because whatever you might say

2112
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:06,619
about someone like Eric Harris he was a

2113
01:31:05,480 --> 01:31:08,750
human being too

2114
01:31:06,619 --> 01:31:10,820
you know there's this idea in the New

2115
01:31:08,750 --> 01:31:12,889
Testament that Christ was he who took

2116
01:31:10,820 --> 01:31:15,340
the sins of the world unto himself it's

2117
01:31:12,889 --> 01:31:18,650
a very complicated idea but part of it

2118
01:31:15,340 --> 01:31:20,420
part of it part of it is associated with

2119
01:31:18,650 --> 01:31:23,300
the idea that he met the devil in the

2120
01:31:20,420 --> 01:31:25,369
desert as well to take the sins of

2121
01:31:23,300 --> 01:31:27,350
mankind onto yourself as to understand

2122
01:31:25,369 --> 01:31:29,750
that within you dwells exactly the same

2123
01:31:27,350 --> 01:31:32,270
spirit that commit the atrocities that

2124
01:31:29,750 --> 01:31:34,219
Columbine or that ran the camps at

2125
01:31:32,270 --> 01:31:35,690
Auschwitz and to actually understand

2126
01:31:34,219 --> 01:31:37,820
that that's part and parcel of your

2127
01:31:35,690 --> 01:31:40,429
makeup and then to take responsibility

2128
01:31:37,820 --> 01:31:42,500
for it and I think that in the aftermath

2129
01:31:40,429 --> 01:31:44,119
of the terrible 20th century that's what

2130
01:31:42,500 --> 01:31:46,369
we're left with we are left with the

2131
01:31:44,119 --> 01:31:48,429
necessity to take responsibility for the

2132
01:31:46,369 --> 01:31:50,900
most terrible aspects of ourselves and

2133
01:31:48,429 --> 01:31:54,310
that way perhaps we can stop those

2134
01:31:50,900 --> 01:31:54,310
terrible things from happening again

2135
01:32:00,689 --> 01:32:06,429
that also means you know that you don't

2136
01:32:03,099 --> 01:32:08,169
look for the you don't look for the what

2137
01:32:06,429 --> 01:32:11,349
would you call it the purveyor of

2138
01:32:08,169 --> 01:32:13,539
malevolence outside yourself right it

2139
01:32:11,349 --> 01:32:15,039
isn't someone else even though sometimes

2140
01:32:13,539 --> 01:32:17,079
it's someone else you know you know what

2141
01:32:15,039 --> 01:32:18,729
I mean it's like there are identifiable

2142
01:32:17,079 --> 01:32:21,069
perpetrators but that's not precisely

2143
01:32:18,729 --> 01:32:22,989
the point the point is something more

2144
01:32:21,069 --> 01:32:24,969
like that the proper place for the

2145
01:32:22,989 --> 01:32:26,669
encapsulation of that malevolence at

2146
01:32:24,969 --> 01:32:29,019
least the proper place to start is

2147
01:32:26,669 --> 01:32:31,030
within the confines of your own

2148
01:32:29,019 --> 01:32:33,909
existence and then perhaps within the

2149
01:32:31,030 --> 01:32:36,849
confines of your family and that way

2150
01:32:33,909 --> 01:32:39,099
you're not a danger to those that you

2151
01:32:36,849 --> 01:32:40,869
miss apprehend as malevolent and evil

2152
01:32:39,099 --> 01:32:43,299
because you won't get your aim right to

2153
01:32:40,869 --> 01:32:45,729
begin with you'll identify them

2154
01:32:43,299 --> 01:32:50,199
improperly and you'll take your revenge

2155
01:32:45,729 --> 01:32:53,079
in a manner that allows you to omit your

2156
01:32:50,199 --> 01:32:55,149
own responsibility to act out your

2157
01:32:53,079 --> 01:32:57,969
unconscious desire for revenge and to

2158
01:32:55,149 --> 01:33:07,119
move the world just that much closer to

2159
01:32:57,969 --> 01:33:08,619
help also Cain kills Abel and then Cain

2160
01:33:07,119 --> 01:33:10,030
gives rise to his descendants one of

2161
01:33:08,619 --> 01:33:12,699
whom is the person who's the first

2162
01:33:10,030 --> 01:33:15,339
artificer in weapons of war and then

2163
01:33:12,699 --> 01:33:18,519
comes the flood right which seems

2164
01:33:15,339 --> 01:33:20,469
perfectly miraculously reasonable to me

2165
01:33:18,519 --> 01:33:22,559
because what those stories do it's so

2166
01:33:20,469 --> 01:33:24,849
amazing that the story of Cain and Abel

2167
01:33:22,559 --> 01:33:28,479
segues into the story of the flood

2168
01:33:24,849 --> 01:33:30,939
because it is the case that the

2169
01:33:28,479 --> 01:33:32,859
catastrophes that beset society can best

2170
01:33:30,939 --> 01:33:35,199
be conceptualized as the spread of

2171
01:33:32,859 --> 01:33:38,260
individual pathology into the social

2172
01:33:35,199 --> 01:33:40,719
world and the envy what would you call

2173
01:33:38,260 --> 01:33:42,280
these the magnification of that

2174
01:33:40,719 --> 01:33:44,949
pathology to the point where everything

2175
01:33:42,280 --> 01:33:46,749
comes apart and I truly believe that if

2176
01:33:44,949 --> 01:33:48,339
you familiarize yourself with the last

2177
01:33:46,749 --> 01:33:50,499
hundred years of history that that's the

2178
01:33:48,339 --> 01:33:52,449
conclusion that you would derive and the

2179
01:33:50,499 --> 01:33:54,519
people who are most wise that I've read

2180
01:33:52,449 --> 01:34:00,609
who commented on that say the same thing

2181
01:33:54,519 --> 01:34:04,869
over and over which is the key to the

2182
01:34:00,609 --> 01:34:08,049
prevention of the horrors of Auschwitz

2183
01:34:04,869 --> 01:34:11,890
and the gulag in the future is the

2184
01:34:08,049 --> 01:34:15,550
reconstruction of the individual soul at

2185
01:34:11,890 --> 01:34:17,410
level of each individual and that's a

2186
01:34:15,550 --> 01:34:20,620
terrible message because it puts the

2187
01:34:17,410 --> 01:34:23,140
burden on you but it's an amazing

2188
01:34:20,620 --> 01:34:26,380
message because it also means that you

2189
01:34:23,140 --> 01:34:29,440
could be the source of the process that

2190
01:34:26,380 --> 01:34:32,710
stops that catastrophe and malevolence

2191
01:34:29,440 --> 01:34:34,630
from ever emerging again and you know

2192
01:34:32,710 --> 01:34:37,210
it's hard for me to imagine that you

2193
01:34:34,630 --> 01:34:39,880
have anything that could possibly be

2194
01:34:37,210 --> 01:34:43,870
better to do with the time that you have

2195
01:34:39,880 --> 01:34:46,750
left well then we see Noah who walks

2196
01:34:43,870 --> 01:34:49,080
with God and who's generations are in

2197
01:34:46,750 --> 01:34:51,430
order right which means that he's

2198
01:34:49,080 --> 01:34:54,240
entered this contract with the good

2199
01:34:51,430 --> 01:34:57,250
let's say that has the protective

2200
01:34:54,240 --> 01:34:59,140
function of the ark he's put his family

2201
01:34:57,250 --> 01:35:00,700
together and he can ride out the worst

2202
01:34:59,140 --> 01:35:02,620
catastrophe and he's actually our

2203
01:35:00,700 --> 01:35:05,020
ancestor right so interesting it's that

2204
01:35:02,620 --> 01:35:08,230
these people who get their act together

2205
01:35:05,020 --> 01:35:10,300
properly and make a contract with the

2206
01:35:08,230 --> 01:35:12,490
good are constantly presented as the

2207
01:35:10,300 --> 01:35:15,190
genuine ancestors of mankind and that's

2208
01:35:12,490 --> 01:35:16,780
a really positive element of the story

2209
01:35:15,190 --> 01:35:19,090
as well and it's one I believe because

2210
01:35:16,780 --> 01:35:20,830
well it hasn't been easy for us to get

2211
01:35:19,090 --> 01:35:23,170
here you know we are the descendants of

2212
01:35:20,830 --> 01:35:25,090
the great heroes of the past and if you

2213
01:35:23,170 --> 01:35:26,550
took all those heroes and you and you

2214
01:35:25,090 --> 01:35:28,750
and you

2215
01:35:26,550 --> 01:35:30,460
and you told their stories and you

2216
01:35:28,750 --> 01:35:32,080
distilled their stories into a single

2217
01:35:30,460 --> 01:35:33,790
story maybe you'd have a story like the

2218
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:37,060
story of Noah or the story of Abraham

2219
01:35:33,790 --> 01:35:39,310
you know the story of the successful the

2220
01:35:37,060 --> 01:35:41,200
story of our forefathers you know I'm

2221
01:35:39,310 --> 01:35:42,820
not the cancer on the planet that

2222
01:35:41,200 --> 01:35:46,450
certain people tend to think that we are

2223
01:35:42,820 --> 01:35:48,250
and so the goal is to be one of the

2224
01:35:46,450 --> 01:35:49,660
people like that and there isn't

2225
01:35:48,250 --> 01:35:51,250
anything better that can possibly be

2226
01:35:49,660 --> 01:35:53,920
done and the alternative is something

2227
01:35:51,250 --> 01:35:55,240
like hell and so Noah rides out the

2228
01:35:53,920 --> 01:35:56,560
storm and that's what everyone wants

2229
01:35:55,240 --> 01:35:59,020
because you want to ride out the storm

2230
01:35:56,560 --> 01:36:01,120
you don't want to be happy because

2231
01:35:59,020 --> 01:36:02,920
that'll just happen if it does or if it

2232
01:36:01,120 --> 01:36:04,660
doesn't but you definitely want to

2233
01:36:02,920 --> 01:36:06,460
constitute yourself so that you can ride

2234
01:36:04,660 --> 01:36:08,290
out the storm because the storm is

2235
01:36:06,460 --> 01:36:09,880
always coming and so then you're

2236
01:36:08,290 --> 01:36:13,000
fortified against the worst and that's

2237
01:36:09,880 --> 01:36:16,210
what you want because well the best you

2238
01:36:13,000 --> 01:36:18,460
can handle the worst you have to prepare

2239
01:36:16,210 --> 01:36:19,960
yourself for and then we see the same

2240
01:36:18,460 --> 01:36:22,030
thing repeated in the story of Abraham

2241
01:36:19,960 --> 01:36:24,520
essentially right Abraham makes this

2242
01:36:22,030 --> 01:36:25,719
contract with the good and constantly

2243
01:36:24,520 --> 01:36:27,519
renews it that's

2244
01:36:25,719 --> 01:36:30,309
cough ice and his worship he constantly

2245
01:36:27,519 --> 01:36:32,289
renews it and he has the adventures that

2246
01:36:30,309 --> 01:36:34,449
are sufficiently typical of the

2247
01:36:32,289 --> 01:36:37,719
adventures of a human being who's alive

2248
01:36:34,449 --> 01:36:39,820
and engaging in the world right he he

2249
01:36:37,719 --> 01:36:43,479
bumps himself up against all the horrors

2250
01:36:39,820 --> 01:36:46,389
of existence and yet the story is told

2251
01:36:43,479 --> 01:36:48,760
in such a manner that reveals that his

2252
01:36:46,389 --> 01:36:52,119
primary ethical commitment to the

2253
01:36:48,760 --> 01:36:54,460
overarching good is sufficient to

2254
01:36:52,119 --> 01:36:57,489
protect him against the vicissitudes of

2255
01:36:54,460 --> 01:37:00,599
existence well that's an optimistic

2256
01:36:57,489 --> 01:37:03,280
story and as a pessimistic person I

2257
01:37:00,599 --> 01:37:06,849
appreciate an optimistic story that's

2258
01:37:03,280 --> 01:37:08,590
believable and the great demands placed

2259
01:37:06,849 --> 01:37:11,380
on Abraham it's not as if this just

2260
01:37:08,590 --> 01:37:12,880
comes to him as a gift he has to be

2261
01:37:11,380 --> 01:37:14,499
willing to sacrifice whatever is

2262
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:16,479
necessary in order to maintain that

2263
01:37:14,499 --> 01:37:18,489
contract and so that seems to me to be

2264
01:37:16,479 --> 01:37:20,170
realistic there's no reason to assume

2265
01:37:18,489 --> 01:37:23,079
that life isn't so difficult that it

2266
01:37:20,170 --> 01:37:24,729
actually demands the best from you that

2267
01:37:23,079 --> 01:37:26,920
it's actually structured in that manner

2268
01:37:24,729 --> 01:37:30,130
and that if the you are willing to

2269
01:37:26,920 --> 01:37:32,320
reveal the best in you in response to

2270
01:37:30,130 --> 01:37:34,179
the vicissitudes of life that you might

2271
01:37:32,320 --> 01:37:39,849
actually prevail and you might actually

2272
01:37:34,179 --> 01:37:43,510
set things straight around you and law

2273
01:37:39,849 --> 01:37:46,840
and what if that was true that would be

2274
01:37:43,510 --> 01:37:50,199
a remarkable thing and I can't see how

2275
01:37:46,840 --> 01:37:52,449
it cannot be true and I can't see that

2276
01:37:50,199 --> 01:37:54,699
it's not stamped on the soul of everyone

2277
01:37:52,449 --> 01:37:57,249
who's conscious I think we all know this

2278
01:37:54,699 --> 01:38:00,670
perfectly well although the stories

2279
01:37:57,249 --> 01:38:04,539
remind us you know Plato Socrates

2280
01:38:00,670 --> 01:38:08,369
believed that all knowledge was

2281
01:38:04,539 --> 01:38:10,989
remembering you know he believed that

2282
01:38:08,369 --> 01:38:14,489
the soul before birth had all knowledge

2283
01:38:10,989 --> 01:38:16,840
and lost it at birth and then experience

2284
01:38:14,489 --> 01:38:18,729
reminded the soul of what it already

2285
01:38:16,840 --> 01:38:22,150
knew and there's something about that

2286
01:38:18,729 --> 01:38:26,949
that's really true because you're not

2287
01:38:22,150 --> 01:38:29,380
just a creature that emerged 30 years

2288
01:38:26,949 --> 01:38:31,300
ago or 40 years ago you're you're the

2289
01:38:29,380 --> 01:38:33,820
inheritor of three and a half billion

2290
01:38:31,300 --> 01:38:36,610
years worth of biological engineering

2291
01:38:33,820 --> 01:38:39,039
right you have your nature stamped

2292
01:38:36,610 --> 01:38:39,670
deeply inside of you far more deeply

2293
01:38:39,039 --> 01:38:41,860
than we

2294
01:38:39,670 --> 01:38:43,420
any of us realize and when you come

2295
01:38:41,860 --> 01:38:45,730
across these great stories these

2296
01:38:43,420 --> 01:38:48,310
reminders they're a reminder of how to

2297
01:38:45,730 --> 01:38:52,140
be properly and they echo in your soul

2298
01:38:48,310 --> 01:38:52,140
because the structure is already there

2299
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:57,820
the external stories are manifestations

2300
01:38:56,020 --> 01:39:00,100
of the internal reality and then they're

2301
01:38:57,820 --> 01:39:08,050
a call to that unter internal reality to

2302
01:39:00,100 --> 01:39:09,880
reveal itself well then we come to the

2303
01:39:08,050 --> 01:39:12,270
end of the Abrahamic stories least this

2304
01:39:09,880 --> 01:39:14,290
section of them with Sarah's death and

2305
01:39:12,270 --> 01:39:17,290
Abraham is called upon to make the

2306
01:39:14,290 --> 01:39:18,790
supreme sacrifice and interestingly not

2307
01:39:17,290 --> 01:39:21,160
because he's willing to make the supreme

2308
01:39:18,790 --> 01:39:24,310
sacrifice he actually doesn't have to

2309
01:39:21,160 --> 01:39:27,160
and that's an interesting thing as well

2310
01:39:24,310 --> 01:39:28,929
because I believe that it's reasonable

2311
01:39:27,160 --> 01:39:32,020
from a psychological perspective to

2312
01:39:28,929 --> 01:39:38,170
point out that the more willing you are

2313
01:39:32,020 --> 01:39:40,810
for example to face death perhaps the

2314
01:39:38,170 --> 01:39:43,510
less likely it is that you're going to

2315
01:39:40,810 --> 01:39:48,730
have to face it at least in an ignoble

2316
01:39:43,510 --> 01:39:53,219
manner and so with that then we'll bring

2317
01:39:48,730 --> 01:39:53,219
this 12 part series to a close

2318
01:39:58,620 --> 01:40:03,490
you know I think that applause is for

2319
01:40:00,970 --> 01:40:07,810
everyone and I hate to say that because

2320
01:40:03,490 --> 01:40:11,080
it sounds so new agey ha ha ha but you

2321
01:40:07,810 --> 01:40:12,850
know it really does it really does seem

2322
01:40:11,080 --> 01:40:15,790
to me that this is a participatory

2323
01:40:12,850 --> 01:40:17,410
exercise you know and that and that it

2324
01:40:15,790 --> 01:40:18,910
would not be possible for me to go

2325
01:40:17,410 --> 01:40:21,310
through these stories without having you

2326
01:40:18,910 --> 01:40:22,900
here to listen and so and I always think

2327
01:40:21,310 --> 01:40:25,660
when talking to a crowd that it's a

2328
01:40:22,900 --> 01:40:27,010
dialogue you know it's a dialogue you

2329
01:40:25,660 --> 01:40:29,800
said and you listen and you've all

2330
01:40:27,010 --> 01:40:31,810
listened and and and thank God for that

2331
01:40:29,800 --> 01:40:33,490
you know and that gives me a chance to

2332
01:40:31,810 --> 01:40:35,200
think and it gives me a chance to watch

2333
01:40:33,490 --> 01:40:37,260
and it gives me a chance to interact

2334
01:40:35,200 --> 01:40:39,820
because you know you're emblematic of of

2335
01:40:37,260 --> 01:40:41,830
humanity at large I suppose that's one

2336
01:40:39,820 --> 01:40:43,810
way of thinking about it and for me to

2337
01:40:41,830 --> 01:40:46,180
be able to craft what I'm saying so that

2338
01:40:43,810 --> 01:40:48,370
it has an impact on all of you here also

2339
01:40:46,180 --> 01:40:49,720
means that I can simultaneously craft it

2340
01:40:48,370 --> 01:40:51,670
so that it has an impact that in

2341
01:40:49,720 --> 01:40:54,310
principle can reach far beyond this

2342
01:40:51,670 --> 01:40:56,950
place and so you know I'm hoping that

2343
01:40:54,310 --> 01:40:58,690
I'm really hoping that one of the things

2344
01:40:56,950 --> 01:41:00,490
that can start to happen with this at

2345
01:40:58,690 --> 01:41:02,590
least is that we can put our culture

2346
01:41:00,490 --> 01:41:04,180
back on its firm foundation because it's

2347
01:41:02,590 --> 01:41:06,100
something that's desperately needed and

2348
01:41:04,180 --> 01:41:08,080
in order to do that we have to

2349
01:41:06,100 --> 01:41:10,840
understand both the evil and the

2350
01:41:08,080 --> 01:41:13,000
nobility of the human soul and that's

2351
01:41:10,840 --> 01:41:15,160
like--that's that's a fundamental truth

2352
01:41:13,000 --> 01:41:16,900
you know and I don't think you can get

2353
01:41:15,160 --> 01:41:18,400
to the nobility without a soldier and

2354
01:41:16,900 --> 01:41:20,440
through the evil I really don't believe

2355
01:41:18,400 --> 01:41:23,860
that at all it's no place for the naive

2356
01:41:20,440 --> 01:41:25,450
to go that's for sure but anyways I

2357
01:41:23,860 --> 01:41:28,420
would like to thank you as you thanked

2358
01:41:25,450 --> 01:41:30,670
me for your close and careful attention

2359
01:41:28,420 --> 01:41:32,890
and your support during all of this it's

2360
01:41:30,670 --> 01:41:36,940
been a really a remarkable experience

2361
01:41:32,890 --> 01:41:42,390
it's certainly sort of developed beyond

2362
01:41:36,940 --> 01:41:42,390
my my dreams so

2363
01:41:54,340 --> 01:42:07,400
on to the questions hi dr. Peterson it

2364
01:42:05,150 --> 01:42:08,900
appears to me from this series and from

2365
01:42:07,400 --> 01:42:10,670
the biblical stories themselves that the

2366
01:42:08,900 --> 01:42:12,380
emphasis of the stories is the utmost

2367
01:42:10,670 --> 01:42:14,630
importance of the fool for the

2368
01:42:12,380 --> 01:42:16,820
maintenance and adaptation of being or

2369
01:42:14,630 --> 01:42:18,949
society the figure will lunge headfirst

2370
01:42:16,820 --> 01:42:20,989
in the uncharted territory explicitly

2371
01:42:18,949 --> 01:42:22,280
aware of the danger and risk of loss and

2372
01:42:20,989 --> 01:42:24,560
confronting what cannot be understood

2373
01:42:22,280 --> 01:42:26,210
but unafraid and with the zeal and that

2374
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:28,610
the dangers of ideological possession

2375
01:42:26,210 --> 01:42:31,340
just as much are just as much of a

2376
01:42:28,610 --> 01:42:33,409
concern as that individuals are

2377
01:42:31,340 --> 01:42:35,060
unwilling and perhaps unable to form an

2378
01:42:33,409 --> 01:42:36,800
opinion and take a stance one way or

2379
01:42:35,060 --> 01:42:38,750
another when confronted with a fork in

2380
01:42:36,800 --> 01:42:40,790
the road or a decision that must be made

2381
01:42:38,750 --> 01:42:43,100
you've seen this apathy apathy

2382
01:42:40,790 --> 01:42:45,080
throughout the universities as I have

2383
01:42:43,100 --> 01:42:47,929
too in the public schooling system my

2384
01:42:45,080 --> 01:42:49,969
question is how can one model being the

2385
01:42:47,929 --> 01:42:51,860
fool to plunge into the unknown and

2386
01:42:49,969 --> 01:42:53,060
publicly fall on your face in pursuit of

2387
01:42:51,860 --> 01:42:55,280
learning in a way that clearly

2388
01:42:53,060 --> 01:43:01,580
demonstrates the urgency and utility of

2389
01:42:55,280 --> 01:43:03,050
the fool well there isn't any difference

2390
01:43:01,580 --> 01:43:04,790
between the pool and someone whose

2391
01:43:03,050 --> 01:43:06,739
courageous right from an archetypal

2392
01:43:04,790 --> 01:43:09,080
perspective and I mean Abraham is a fool

2393
01:43:06,739 --> 01:43:11,570
obviously when he starts his his

2394
01:43:09,080 --> 01:43:13,909
adventures I mean the story lays it out

2395
01:43:11,570 --> 01:43:16,159
in that manner he's far too old to be

2396
01:43:13,909 --> 01:43:19,219
leaving home for example he's a late

2397
01:43:16,159 --> 01:43:21,020
bloomer you know and and then he has he

2398
01:43:19,219 --> 01:43:22,730
has a lot of catastrophic adventures

2399
01:43:21,020 --> 01:43:24,800
along the way and certainly you could

2400
01:43:22,730 --> 01:43:26,659
imagine that had you encountered him

2401
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:28,400
when he first encountered the famine in

2402
01:43:26,659 --> 01:43:31,580
the land of strangers when he first went

2403
01:43:28,400 --> 01:43:34,070
out that the idea that he had he had

2404
01:43:31,580 --> 01:43:37,790
followed his misguided intuitions would

2405
01:43:34,070 --> 01:43:39,860
have been self-evident but in the

2406
01:43:37,790 --> 01:43:43,790
Abrahamic stories there is this call to

2407
01:43:39,860 --> 01:43:45,260
get out and do and that's it and the

2408
01:43:43,790 --> 01:43:47,060
thing is is that you know one of the

2409
01:43:45,260 --> 01:43:48,889
things I've learned to put it to make it

2410
01:43:47,060 --> 01:43:50,360
concretely is that like I've done a lot

2411
01:43:48,889 --> 01:43:52,340
of different things in my life and every

2412
01:43:50,360 --> 01:43:54,920
time I did a new thing I was a fool I

2413
01:43:52,340 --> 01:43:58,370
did it badly I was an imposter right and

2414
01:43:54,920 --> 01:43:59,389
and and because I when you first start

2415
01:43:58,370 --> 01:44:02,090
to do something you don't know what

2416
01:43:59,389 --> 01:44:03,460
you're doing but that that's okay that's

2417
01:44:02,090 --> 01:44:04,550
an acceptance of your vulnerability

2418
01:44:03,460 --> 01:44:06,230
right

2419
01:44:04,550 --> 01:44:07,940
and your ignorance that's humility in

2420
01:44:06,230 --> 01:44:09,410
some sense the willingness to be a fool

2421
01:44:07,940 --> 01:44:11,870
in a nude in the land of strangers

2422
01:44:09,410 --> 01:44:14,240
that's it the willingness to be a fool

2423
01:44:11,870 --> 01:44:16,520
in the land of strangers and that's an

2424
01:44:14,240 --> 01:44:18,110
act of courage because you also reveal

2425
01:44:16,520 --> 01:44:20,120
your vulnerability to the world by

2426
01:44:18,110 --> 01:44:21,470
stumbling around but as long as you're

2427
01:44:20,120 --> 01:44:24,230
stumbling forward then you're going to

2428
01:44:21,470 --> 01:44:26,780
move forward now how do you do that more

2429
01:44:24,230 --> 01:44:28,700
concretely are you aim at an ideal right

2430
01:44:26,780 --> 01:44:31,160
and you aim at an ideal that's beyond

2431
01:44:28,700 --> 01:44:33,170
you now maybe you don't aim to begin

2432
01:44:31,160 --> 01:44:36,160
with it an idea that ideal that's so

2433
01:44:33,170 --> 01:44:38,570
beyond you that you're crushed by its

2434
01:44:36,160 --> 01:44:41,930
magnificence you know maybe that's

2435
01:44:38,570 --> 01:44:44,270
that's that's too demotivating to move

2436
01:44:41,930 --> 01:44:47,060
you but you could at least conceptualize

2437
01:44:44,270 --> 01:44:49,700
yourself as the you that you are with

2438
01:44:47,060 --> 01:44:52,160
fewer of the faults that you know of and

2439
01:44:49,700 --> 01:44:53,630
that's a good start and I also think

2440
01:44:52,160 --> 01:44:57,650
that's associated with the idea of

2441
01:44:53,630 --> 01:45:00,220
humility take stock figure out how it is

2442
01:44:57,650 --> 01:45:04,280
that you're not who you could be and

2443
01:45:00,220 --> 01:45:06,890
then move in that direction and accept

2444
01:45:04,280 --> 01:45:09,650
the consequences you know you're you're

2445
01:45:06,890 --> 01:45:11,450
going to get slapped a lot but maybe

2446
01:45:09,650 --> 01:45:13,730
with each slap you'll straighten up a

2447
01:45:11,450 --> 01:45:15,260
little bit especially if you listen even

2448
01:45:13,730 --> 01:45:17,270
to the people who are slapping you

2449
01:45:15,260 --> 01:45:20,750
because sometimes they're the ones who

2450
01:45:17,270 --> 01:45:22,790
can reveal for you very quickly where it

2451
01:45:20,750 --> 01:45:24,110
is that you're weak and insufficient so

2452
01:45:22,790 --> 01:45:28,520
that you won't have to be that way in

2453
01:45:24,110 --> 01:45:36,119
the future so yeah

2454
01:45:28,520 --> 01:45:40,300
[Applause]

2455
01:45:36,119 --> 01:45:43,060
hello dr. Peterson I have no questions

2456
01:45:40,300 --> 01:45:44,860
for you all I ever wanted to do is just

2457
01:45:43,060 --> 01:45:47,290
stand in front of you and be able to

2458
01:45:44,860 --> 01:45:50,830
thank you for everything you've done

2459
01:45:47,290 --> 01:46:06,159
fine my pleasure

2460
01:45:50,830 --> 01:46:08,679
oh good morning citizen Peterson you got

2461
01:46:06,159 --> 01:46:10,960
a short one yeah I do I mean a question

2462
01:46:08,679 --> 01:46:13,900
eight is the best question relax

2463
01:46:10,960 --> 01:46:14,530
trust me this one's good but first I'll

2464
01:46:13,900 --> 01:46:17,380
break the ice

2465
01:46:14,530 --> 01:46:19,300
now I'm going keyboard up said so state

2466
01:46:17,380 --> 01:46:20,800
now no icebreaker you want me to get

2467
01:46:19,300 --> 01:46:22,960
right into the real question I want you

2468
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:26,290
to get right into the question all right

2469
01:46:22,960 --> 01:46:28,570
so this question is about hyper critical

2470
01:46:26,290 --> 01:46:30,159
thinking yep now everyone knows the

2471
01:46:28,570 --> 01:46:33,280
critical thinking is a great thing to

2472
01:46:30,159 --> 01:46:35,830
develop you have to be able to cook I

2473
01:46:33,280 --> 01:46:37,869
guess think about your ideas so if

2474
01:46:35,830 --> 01:46:39,730
information is presented do you have to

2475
01:46:37,869 --> 01:46:43,480
decide if it's legitimate or if there's

2476
01:46:39,730 --> 01:46:45,969
some sort of deceit behind it but when

2477
01:46:43,480 --> 01:46:48,159
it's taken to its extreme no matter how

2478
01:46:45,969 --> 01:46:50,290
great or noble somebody is you can

2479
01:46:48,159 --> 01:46:52,989
always find a crack in the armor and try

2480
01:46:50,290 --> 01:46:54,849
to figure out how they're covering up

2481
01:46:52,989 --> 01:46:56,619
something that's not great about them

2482
01:46:54,849 --> 01:47:00,010
you know and you might then discredit

2483
01:46:56,619 --> 01:47:01,570
everything they do is just a facade okay

2484
01:47:00,010 --> 01:47:02,889
so let me stop you there for a sec

2485
01:47:01,570 --> 01:47:05,080
because I want to address two of the

2486
01:47:02,889 --> 01:47:07,389
issues that you already brought up so

2487
01:47:05,080 --> 01:47:10,210
there's there's the issue of hyper

2488
01:47:07,389 --> 01:47:11,889
critical thinking partly in relationship

2489
01:47:10,210 --> 01:47:14,380
to yourself and partly in relationship

2490
01:47:11,889 --> 01:47:16,449
to others so I'd like to address the

2491
01:47:14,380 --> 01:47:19,060
issue with regards to yourself to begin

2492
01:47:16,449 --> 01:47:21,969
with so there's this idea that Carl Jung

2493
01:47:19,060 --> 01:47:23,920
developed um he extracted it I don't

2494
01:47:21,969 --> 01:47:25,480
know from where from some ancient

2495
01:47:23,920 --> 01:47:27,429
writings that he was familiar with I

2496
01:47:25,480 --> 01:47:29,380
believe they were Jewish writings he

2497
01:47:27,429 --> 01:47:32,020
said that classically speaking

2498
01:47:29,380 --> 01:47:35,230
traditionally speaking God was viewed to

2499
01:47:32,020 --> 01:47:37,330
rule being with two hands the right hand

2500
01:47:35,230 --> 01:47:40,030
and left hand and the right hand was

2501
01:47:37,330 --> 01:47:42,369
justice and that was you're going to get

2502
01:47:40,030 --> 01:47:45,489
what's coming to you but the left hand

2503
01:47:42,369 --> 01:47:46,430
was mercy and the idea essentially was

2504
01:47:45,489 --> 01:47:47,900
that the cause

2505
01:47:46,430 --> 01:47:49,430
could not exist without the proper

2506
01:47:47,900 --> 01:47:51,740
combination of justice and mercy

2507
01:47:49,430 --> 01:47:53,390
you should get what's coming to you but

2508
01:47:51,740 --> 01:47:56,330
people are fallible and they make

2509
01:47:53,390 --> 01:47:59,060
mistakes and so it's reasonable to apply

2510
01:47:56,330 --> 01:48:00,260
that to yourself you know there's an

2511
01:47:59,060 --> 01:48:02,570
idea that's being developed by

2512
01:48:00,260 --> 01:48:05,060
psychologists over the last few decades

2513
01:48:02,570 --> 01:48:07,250
that people are basically narcissistic

2514
01:48:05,060 --> 01:48:08,510
and that they generally feel that

2515
01:48:07,250 --> 01:48:11,390
they're better at most things than other

2516
01:48:08,510 --> 01:48:13,010
people I don't buy that I don't think

2517
01:48:11,390 --> 01:48:14,540
the experimental evidence for that is

2518
01:48:13,010 --> 01:48:16,330
very strong and I certainly haven't seen

2519
01:48:14,540 --> 01:48:18,230
that for example in my clinical practice

2520
01:48:16,330 --> 01:48:19,970
where I've seen that people are

2521
01:48:18,230 --> 01:48:23,570
generally far harder on themselves than

2522
01:48:19,970 --> 01:48:25,070
they are on other people one example of

2523
01:48:23,570 --> 01:48:26,570
that I've written about this in my new

2524
01:48:25,070 --> 01:48:28,190
book too is that you know if you have a

2525
01:48:26,570 --> 01:48:30,800
pet that's sick and you take it to the

2526
01:48:28,190 --> 01:48:32,480
vet and you get medication you're very

2527
01:48:30,800 --> 01:48:34,610
likely to give the pet the entire course

2528
01:48:32,480 --> 01:48:36,890
of medication to go to the pharmacy to

2529
01:48:34,610 --> 01:48:38,870
get the prescription filled to give the

2530
01:48:36,890 --> 01:48:41,600
pet the medication to follow it through

2531
01:48:38,870 --> 01:48:43,460
but if you are the person who has the

2532
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:46,310
problem yeah you all laughed if you know

2533
01:48:43,460 --> 01:48:48,170
the story it's like a 30 you won't even

2534
01:48:46,310 --> 01:48:50,330
go fill the prescription and of the

2535
01:48:48,170 --> 01:48:52,610
remaining 2/3 of you half of them won't

2536
01:48:50,330 --> 01:48:54,440
take it to completion and you think well

2537
01:48:52,610 --> 01:48:57,440
why are people like that and I think

2538
01:48:54,440 --> 01:48:59,240
it's because they know themselves they

2539
01:48:57,440 --> 01:49:01,640
have contempt for themselves because of

2540
01:48:59,240 --> 01:49:03,860
their flaws and then they come to

2541
01:49:01,640 --> 01:49:05,810
despise themselves and I think that's a

2542
01:49:03,860 --> 01:49:08,240
big mistake that's Locke that's too much

2543
01:49:05,810 --> 01:49:10,160
justice and not enough mercy and you

2544
01:49:08,240 --> 01:49:12,500
know Jung wrote about the biblical

2545
01:49:10,160 --> 01:49:14,540
injunction that you should treat your

2546
01:49:12,500 --> 01:49:17,480
neighbor as if he were yourself

2547
01:49:14,540 --> 01:49:19,280
essentially but he talked about that as

2548
01:49:17,480 --> 01:49:21,830
an equation which was quite interesting

2549
01:49:19,280 --> 01:49:23,510
so because it's often read as something

2550
01:49:21,830 --> 01:49:25,670
like you should be nice to people which

2551
01:49:23,510 --> 01:49:28,190
is not what it means at all because

2552
01:49:25,670 --> 01:49:30,650
first nice is a very low-end virtue but

2553
01:49:28,190 --> 01:49:33,200
it isn't what it means what it means is

2554
01:49:30,650 --> 01:49:36,230
that you should you should treat your

2555
01:49:33,200 --> 01:49:38,990
neighbor as if he or she is someone that

2556
01:49:36,230 --> 01:49:40,700
you wish to encourage and develop but

2557
01:49:38,990 --> 01:49:42,650
that you should also have exactly the

2558
01:49:40,700 --> 01:49:44,570
same attitude towards yourself which is

2559
01:49:42,650 --> 01:49:46,420
weak sort of in some sense regardless of

2560
01:49:44,570 --> 01:49:49,100
what your opinion is of yourself

2561
01:49:46,420 --> 01:49:50,930
critical let's say hyper critical even

2562
01:49:49,100 --> 01:49:53,240
is often the case with people who are

2563
01:49:50,930 --> 01:49:57,110
anxious or perhaps who are hyper

2564
01:49:53,240 --> 01:50:00,139
conscientious you have to put forward to

2565
01:49:57,110 --> 01:50:02,030
yourself the same sympathy we could

2566
01:50:00,139 --> 01:50:04,429
say that you would extend to someone

2567
01:50:02,030 --> 01:50:06,229
else that you cared for that's the thing

2568
01:50:04,429 --> 01:50:08,269
is that you have to come to treat

2569
01:50:06,229 --> 01:50:10,610
yourself as if you're someone that you

2570
01:50:08,269 --> 01:50:13,099
care for and I mean that technically you

2571
01:50:10,610 --> 01:50:14,780
know you detach yourself from yourself

2572
01:50:13,099 --> 01:50:18,619
and you think okay well if I was going

2573
01:50:14,780 --> 01:50:21,199
to construct a mode of being that was

2574
01:50:18,619 --> 01:50:23,269
optimal for this person that I happen to

2575
01:50:21,199 --> 01:50:24,889
be what would that look like

2576
01:50:23,269 --> 01:50:26,510
and that's sort of independent of

2577
01:50:24,889 --> 01:50:28,729
whether or not you think you deserve it

2578
01:50:26,510 --> 01:50:30,260
it's like maybe you deserve it maybe you

2579
01:50:28,729 --> 01:50:33,169
don't innocent until proven guilty

2580
01:50:30,260 --> 01:50:35,899
that's a pretty good policy but you

2581
01:50:33,169 --> 01:50:38,479
should come to lay out a mode of being

2582
01:50:35,899 --> 01:50:41,300
for yourself that gives you some credit

2583
01:50:38,479 --> 01:50:42,919
you know when that will also help you in

2584
01:50:41,300 --> 01:50:44,599
your dealings with other people but it's

2585
01:50:42,919 --> 01:50:47,630
often very difficult for people to do

2586
01:50:44,599 --> 01:50:52,219
that to themselves okay so that's the

2587
01:50:47,630 --> 01:50:53,809
that's the first part of that perfect so

2588
01:50:52,219 --> 01:50:55,929
it starts out with this hyper critical

2589
01:50:53,809 --> 01:50:58,579
thinking and you talked a lot about

2590
01:50:55,929 --> 01:51:01,699
Nietzsche's assertion about the death of

2591
01:50:58,579 --> 01:51:05,419
God but I see it sort of more like a

2592
01:51:01,699 --> 01:51:08,360
willful destruction of the heroic ideal

2593
01:51:05,419 --> 01:51:11,090
and I guess several months ago I had

2594
01:51:08,360 --> 01:51:15,439
occasion to look up a definition or

2595
01:51:11,090 --> 01:51:18,559
explanation for the zeitgeist of modern

2596
01:51:15,439 --> 01:51:20,809
victimhood outraged culture and I saw it

2597
01:51:18,559 --> 01:51:23,840
in this particular case and I found and

2598
01:51:20,809 --> 01:51:26,389
this paragraph okay this has what you

2599
01:51:23,840 --> 01:51:29,449
called the rhythmic cadence that just

2600
01:51:26,389 --> 01:51:31,729
made my hair stand up on sense and if

2601
01:51:29,449 --> 01:51:34,929
you could look at it and read that this

2602
01:51:31,729 --> 01:51:34,929
is better than the Lawson

2603
01:51:37,090 --> 01:51:41,480
the image of man that dominates in

2604
01:51:39,620 --> 01:51:43,760
modern literature in visual art cinema

2605
01:51:41,480 --> 01:51:45,530
and theater is primarily a group gloomy

2606
01:51:43,760 --> 01:51:47,960
image the Great and the noble are

2607
01:51:45,530 --> 01:51:49,940
suspect from the outset they must be

2608
01:51:47,960 --> 01:51:52,070
torn from their pedestal so that one can

2609
01:51:49,940 --> 01:51:55,190
see through them morality counts as

2610
01:51:52,070 --> 01:51:56,810
hypocrisy enjoy a self-deception anyone

2611
01:51:55,190 --> 01:51:58,670
who simply puts trust in the beautiful

2612
01:51:56,810 --> 01:52:01,160
and the good is either inexcusably in

2613
01:51:58,670 --> 01:52:03,950
genuine or acting with evil intent

2614
01:52:01,160 --> 01:52:06,670
the truly moral attitude is suspicion

2615
01:52:03,950 --> 01:52:09,230
and its greatest success is in exposing

2616
01:52:06,670 --> 01:52:11,900
criticism of society is obligatory

2617
01:52:09,230 --> 01:52:13,820
it is impossible to find words lurid and

2618
01:52:11,900 --> 01:52:15,950
brutal enough to describe the dangers

2619
01:52:13,820 --> 01:52:19,370
that threaten us this delight in the

2620
01:52:15,950 --> 01:52:21,290
negative is not however unlimited there

2621
01:52:19,370 --> 01:52:23,780
exists at the same time an obligation to

2622
01:52:21,290 --> 01:52:25,850
be optimistic and the failure to observe

2623
01:52:23,780 --> 01:52:28,250
this obligation does not go unpunished

2624
01:52:25,850 --> 01:52:29,540
for example anyone who expresses the

2625
01:52:28,250 --> 01:52:31,040
view that not everything in the

2626
01:52:29,540 --> 01:52:32,990
intellectual development of the modern

2627
01:52:31,040 --> 01:52:34,880
period has been correct that is

2628
01:52:32,990 --> 01:52:36,350
necessary in some essential areas to

2629
01:52:34,880 --> 01:52:38,870
reflect on the shared wisdom of the

2630
01:52:36,350 --> 01:52:40,910
great cultures has chosen to make the

2631
01:52:38,870 --> 01:52:42,770
wrong kind of criticism he finds himself

2632
01:52:40,910 --> 01:52:44,060
suddenly construct confronted with a

2633
01:52:42,770 --> 01:52:45,950
resolute apologia

2634
01:52:44,060 --> 01:52:48,200
for the fundamental decisions of the

2635
01:52:45,950 --> 01:52:50,150
modern age no matter how much delight

2636
01:52:48,200 --> 01:52:51,860
one may take indication he is not

2637
01:52:50,150 --> 01:52:53,420
permitted to call into question the view

2638
01:52:51,860 --> 01:52:55,310
that the fundamental trajectory of

2639
01:52:53,420 --> 01:52:57,050
historical development is progress and

2640
01:52:55,310 --> 01:53:00,680
that the good lies in the future and

2641
01:52:57,050 --> 01:53:04,310
nowhere else you know I thought a lot

2642
01:53:00,680 --> 01:53:08,150
about nihilism let's say and and its

2643
01:53:04,310 --> 01:53:10,790
justification and I think that a very

2644
01:53:08,150 --> 01:53:12,740
powerful justification for nihilism can

2645
01:53:10,790 --> 01:53:14,630
be found in the mirror observation that

2646
01:53:12,740 --> 01:53:18,490
life is rife with tragedy and

2647
01:53:14,630 --> 01:53:22,810
malevolence of which there is no doubt

2648
01:53:18,490 --> 01:53:25,100
but then I got suspicious of that

2649
01:53:22,810 --> 01:53:28,220
rationale for nihilism over the years

2650
01:53:25,100 --> 01:53:29,600
because a counter position to it emerged

2651
01:53:28,220 --> 01:53:31,550
and this is something Nietzsche of

2652
01:53:29,600 --> 01:53:35,480
course concentrated on as well that had

2653
01:53:31,550 --> 01:53:37,670
more to do with resentment it's like you

2654
01:53:35,480 --> 01:53:40,250
can imagine negation of the heroic ideal

2655
01:53:37,670 --> 01:53:42,320
from despair from the despair of save

2656
01:53:40,250 --> 01:53:46,130
produced by tragedy and by exposure to

2657
01:53:42,320 --> 01:53:47,480
malevolence but it's also it's

2658
01:53:46,130 --> 01:53:48,890
completely and delightfully

2659
01:53:47,480 --> 01:53:51,110
irresponsible to negate

2660
01:53:48,890 --> 01:53:53,750
heroic ideal because it means that you

2661
01:53:51,110 --> 01:53:56,450
don't have any responsibilities and it

2662
01:53:53,750 --> 01:54:00,080
seems to me that if you're nihilistic

2663
01:53:56,450 --> 01:54:02,570
and prone to criticize the heroic

2664
01:54:00,080 --> 01:54:04,580
foundation of let's say Western culture

2665
01:54:02,570 --> 01:54:07,130
that one of the first questions that you

2666
01:54:04,580 --> 01:54:09,710
could ask yourself is what makes you so

2667
01:54:07,130 --> 01:54:11,900
sure that you're appropriately cynical

2668
01:54:09,710 --> 01:54:14,060
suspicious and critical and not just

2669
01:54:11,900 --> 01:54:15,770
running away as fast as you possibly can

2670
01:54:14,060 --> 01:54:18,710
from every bit of responsibility that

2671
01:54:15,770 --> 01:54:19,780
you could possibly adopt and I think

2672
01:54:18,710 --> 01:54:21,830
that that's a perfectly reasonable

2673
01:54:19,780 --> 01:54:23,900
perspective and I think that that is

2674
01:54:21,830 --> 01:54:25,400
reflected to some degree in what the

2675
01:54:23,900 --> 01:54:26,930
person who wrote this paragraph was

2676
01:54:25,400 --> 01:54:30,470
attempting to you guess who it was or

2677
01:54:26,930 --> 01:54:31,280
was that fair no I can't really no ha ha

2678
01:54:30,470 --> 01:54:34,480
ha ha ha ha

2679
01:54:31,280 --> 01:54:37,670
I left you a hint off at them who is it

2680
01:54:34,480 --> 01:54:39,530
Cardinal Ratzinger come ah

2681
01:54:37,670 --> 01:54:43,450
all right I'm going to take another

2682
01:54:39,530 --> 01:54:43,450
question and well done

2683
01:54:46,480 --> 01:54:53,330
hello hello how are you doing doing good

2684
01:54:50,510 --> 01:54:58,370
dr. Pearson it's been a pleasure 12

2685
01:54:53,330 --> 01:55:01,310
weeks 12 12 moments let's say okay so

2686
01:54:58,370 --> 01:55:04,760
two weeks ago we talked about your

2687
01:55:01,310 --> 01:55:07,970
mischievous suggestion I might say to

2688
01:55:04,760 --> 01:55:10,820
cut the university's funding by 25% and

2689
01:55:07,970 --> 01:55:14,510
how that might have influenced that sort

2690
01:55:10,820 --> 01:55:16,850
of language and Andrew sheers platform

2691
01:55:14,510 --> 01:55:18,800
right yeah and so and then you discussed

2692
01:55:16,850 --> 01:55:23,600
how you're not exactly sure what your

2693
01:55:18,800 --> 01:55:25,070
role is in all of this and and that you

2694
01:55:23,600 --> 01:55:28,930
don't want to be in a war and you don't

2695
01:55:25,070 --> 01:55:33,710
want to be using warlike language and

2696
01:55:28,930 --> 01:55:36,440
and I think I think what you what you

2697
01:55:33,710 --> 01:55:40,130
want to be doing is is you're trying to

2698
01:55:36,440 --> 01:55:45,890
restore order but not not but not but

2699
01:55:40,130 --> 01:55:48,500
not have conflict and and so I so I so

2700
01:55:45,890 --> 01:55:51,650
after the after the lecture two weeks

2701
01:55:48,500 --> 01:55:55,190
ago I asked you like maybe I maybe I

2702
01:55:51,650 --> 01:55:58,730
should do some sales work for your post

2703
01:55:55,190 --> 01:56:00,940
modern lexicon website and but I think

2704
01:55:58,730 --> 01:56:03,430
I've found a better niche

2705
01:56:00,940 --> 01:56:07,690
for someone of my temperament to help

2706
01:56:03,430 --> 01:56:10,870
this cause so I think that so I go to

2707
01:56:07,690 --> 01:56:14,320
the house University and because so many

2708
01:56:10,870 --> 01:56:18,900
students are dropping out especially men

2709
01:56:14,320 --> 01:56:21,690
and especially at I think minorities

2710
01:56:18,900 --> 01:56:23,860
they've created this team called the

2711
01:56:21,690 --> 01:56:27,280
Student Success team or something

2712
01:56:23,860 --> 01:56:30,219
Student Success advisors yeah and you've

2713
01:56:27,280 --> 01:56:35,590
been extracting credibly successful

2714
01:56:30,219 --> 01:56:38,500
crowdfunding for your research and on

2715
01:56:35,590 --> 01:56:40,750
your patreon and I think like how much

2716
01:56:38,500 --> 01:56:44,830
does it cost for a single person to do

2717
01:56:40,750 --> 01:56:46,500
the self altering program well it's two

2718
01:56:44,830 --> 01:56:50,140
for one so it's about fifteen dollars

2719
01:56:46,500 --> 01:56:52,840
okay so okay so nothing then basically

2720
01:56:50,140 --> 01:56:55,960
um but I was thinking that we could

2721
01:56:52,840 --> 01:56:58,900
somehow we could incorporate the self

2722
01:56:55,960 --> 01:57:03,190
authoring program into this into this

2723
01:56:58,900 --> 01:57:06,219
new advisor committee at Dow so that

2724
01:57:03,190 --> 01:57:08,920
students can knock yourself out man do

2725
01:57:06,219 --> 01:57:10,870
it that's what that's the other like the

2726
01:57:08,920 --> 01:57:13,000
data for the future authoring program is

2727
01:57:10,870 --> 01:57:15,400
quite clear if students even do it for

2728
01:57:13,000 --> 01:57:17,050
an hour before they go to university

2729
01:57:15,400 --> 01:57:18,699
they have a thirty thirty percent less

2730
01:57:17,050 --> 01:57:21,640
chance of dropping out the first

2731
01:57:18,699 --> 01:57:23,140
semester so you know and it would really

2732
01:57:21,640 --> 01:57:25,180
night be nice to see some student

2733
01:57:23,140 --> 01:57:27,699
organizations that were seriously

2734
01:57:25,180 --> 01:57:29,320
devoted to facilitating student success

2735
01:57:27,699 --> 01:57:32,260
you might think that's what student

2736
01:57:29,320 --> 01:57:34,300
organizations should do in fact well it

2737
01:57:32,260 --> 01:57:36,100
seems rather self-evident when you think

2738
01:57:34,300 --> 01:57:37,390
about it but you know so I would say

2739
01:57:36,100 --> 01:57:41,560
like if you're oriented in that

2740
01:57:37,390 --> 01:57:43,840
direction get outer so it's a fine plan

2741
01:57:41,560 --> 01:57:45,160
and it's I like the emphasis of it

2742
01:57:43,840 --> 01:57:47,890
because you're directing yourself

2743
01:57:45,160 --> 01:57:50,080
towards the facilitation of individual

2744
01:57:47,890 --> 01:57:52,120
accomplishment and you're at least going

2745
01:57:50,080 --> 01:57:54,280
to do very little harm that way and

2746
01:57:52,120 --> 01:57:56,739
that's a really good start man you know

2747
01:57:54,280 --> 01:57:57,850
that's that because that's that's what

2748
01:57:56,739 --> 01:58:00,070
you should think about when you're

2749
01:57:57,850 --> 01:58:02,140
setting out to make things better the

2750
01:58:00,070 --> 01:58:04,300
first thing you should think is I'm not

2751
01:58:02,140 --> 01:58:06,820
so sure I know what I'm doing so why

2752
01:58:04,300 --> 01:58:09,219
don't I first attempt to do the least

2753
01:58:06,820 --> 01:58:11,110
amount of harm possible and by

2754
01:58:09,219 --> 01:58:13,750
concentrating on helping someone develop

2755
01:58:11,110 --> 01:58:14,880
their own plan and and implement that

2756
01:58:13,750 --> 01:58:16,599
into the future

2757
01:58:14,880 --> 01:58:19,030
encouraging them with regards to

2758
01:58:16,599 --> 01:58:20,830
whatever success they would like to find

2759
01:58:19,030 --> 01:58:22,989
their way there's a pretty low

2760
01:58:20,830 --> 01:58:25,300
probability that you're going to act the

2761
01:58:22,989 --> 01:58:28,659
terror tyrant and and and play a

2762
01:58:25,300 --> 01:58:31,090
detrimental role so good luck

2763
01:58:28,659 --> 01:58:32,590
maybe we can communicate thank you yes

2764
01:58:31,090 --> 01:58:38,260
I'm gonna send you an email thank you

2765
01:58:32,590 --> 01:58:40,599
very much hi dr. Peterson this is the

2766
01:58:38,260 --> 01:58:41,770
first of these lectures that I've been

2767
01:58:40,599 --> 01:58:44,320
here to listen to but I've listened to

2768
01:58:41,770 --> 01:58:45,730
all of them on YouTube so far oh boy

2769
01:58:44,320 --> 01:58:49,659
they're not close enough all right wait

2770
01:58:45,730 --> 01:58:52,179
that's good okay yeah and I've been

2771
01:58:49,659 --> 01:58:55,570
trying to think up this question since

2772
01:58:52,179 --> 01:58:57,040
basically the first lecture because I'm

2773
01:58:55,570 --> 01:59:00,219
a seminary student at an evangelical

2774
01:58:57,040 --> 01:59:01,750
seminary and a lot of what you've been

2775
01:59:00,219 --> 01:59:03,849
saying has really been resonating and

2776
01:59:01,750 --> 01:59:07,210
it's and it's really been fascinating to

2777
01:59:03,849 --> 01:59:08,260
listen to and you know there's many

2778
01:59:07,210 --> 01:59:09,610
people who have been asking you

2779
01:59:08,260 --> 01:59:11,770
questions like what do you believe about

2780
01:59:09,610 --> 01:59:13,300
the resurrection do you believe in God

2781
01:59:11,770 --> 01:59:14,409
are you a Christian and all these sorts

2782
01:59:13,300 --> 01:59:15,670
of things and you know I've been

2783
01:59:14,409 --> 01:59:17,739
listening very closely to all your

2784
01:59:15,670 --> 01:59:19,360
answers and have groups of friends on

2785
01:59:17,739 --> 01:59:21,520
Facebook or bowling following very

2786
01:59:19,360 --> 01:59:23,080
closely say or what Peterson said this

2787
01:59:21,520 --> 01:59:26,830
time maybe he's one of us finally or

2788
01:59:23,080 --> 01:59:29,770
something like that but but at the same

2789
01:59:26,830 --> 01:59:31,989
time other ways that you explain some of

2790
01:59:29,770 --> 01:59:34,239
the stories sound very close to what we

2791
01:59:31,989 --> 01:59:36,219
call theological liberalism you know in

2792
01:59:34,239 --> 01:59:38,500
the 19th century the idea that using

2793
01:59:36,219 --> 01:59:39,639
historical critical methods of reading

2794
01:59:38,500 --> 01:59:41,710
and interpreting the Bible and

2795
01:59:39,639 --> 01:59:43,630
understanding Jesus more as a moral

2796
01:59:41,710 --> 01:59:45,429
figure than as a literal historical

2797
01:59:43,630 --> 01:59:49,179
figure and whose atonement provides

2798
01:59:45,429 --> 01:59:50,469
satisfaction for man so I tried to

2799
01:59:49,179 --> 01:59:52,090
figure out what the question was because

2800
01:59:50,469 --> 01:59:53,800
I could interpret what some of your

2801
01:59:52,090 --> 01:59:56,650
answers were so I'm going to put it in

2802
01:59:53,800 --> 01:59:59,290
more of a general way okay where exactly

2803
01:59:56,650 --> 02:00:01,900
do you see yourself differing from

2804
01:59:59,290 --> 02:00:04,389
traditional Orthodox evangelical

2805
02:00:01,900 --> 02:00:07,570
Christianity and and why would you

2806
02:00:04,389 --> 02:00:08,830
differ there given how much you you seem

2807
02:00:07,570 --> 02:00:10,869
to understand the importance of the

2808
02:00:08,830 --> 02:00:13,540
biblical stories and the Western history

2809
02:00:10,869 --> 02:00:14,860
in Western history okay okay well that's

2810
02:00:13,540 --> 02:00:18,699
a good that's a good question

2811
02:00:14,860 --> 02:00:21,550
well I offer obviously I have to answer

2812
02:00:18,699 --> 02:00:23,230
in a general way I mean I think that one

2813
02:00:21,550 --> 02:00:25,510
of the things that makes me different is

2814
02:00:23,230 --> 02:00:28,060
that I take the idea that things are

2815
02:00:25,510 --> 02:00:30,270
fourteen billion years old seriously

2816
02:00:28,060 --> 02:00:32,770
you know and and the idea of evolution

2817
02:00:30,270 --> 02:00:35,800
seriously I mean as Daz does the

2818
02:00:32,770 --> 02:00:38,230
Catholic Church by the way and so but I

2819
02:00:35,800 --> 02:00:40,540
don't see that as an impediment to the

2820
02:00:38,230 --> 02:00:42,840
pursuit that I'm undertaking now I don't

2821
02:00:40,540 --> 02:00:45,160
know how to bridge that gap precisely

2822
02:00:42,840 --> 02:00:47,260
but I'm not that worried about it I mean

2823
02:00:45,160 --> 02:00:48,790
you can't bridge every gap it's just not

2824
02:00:47,260 --> 02:00:51,280
possible it would require infinite

2825
02:00:48,790 --> 02:00:53,110
knowledge okay and how so that that's

2826
02:00:51,280 --> 02:00:55,150
one major because I'm coming at this

2827
02:00:53,110 --> 02:00:56,350
from the scientific I really am coming

2828
02:00:55,150 --> 02:00:58,360
at this from the scientific perspective

2829
02:00:56,350 --> 02:00:59,890
you know like I try to make sure that

2830
02:00:58,360 --> 02:01:01,990
everything that I talk about is

2831
02:00:59,890 --> 02:01:04,030
commensurate with current scientific

2832
02:01:01,990 --> 02:01:05,500
knowledge now current scientific

2833
02:01:04,030 --> 02:01:07,300
knowledge no doubt is airing in all

2834
02:01:05,500 --> 02:01:09,520
sorts of ways like I think our notion

2835
02:01:07,300 --> 02:01:11,980
about exactly how evolution progresses

2836
02:01:09,520 --> 02:01:13,780
is flawed in many many ways and the

2837
02:01:11,980 --> 02:01:15,460
recent discoveries in the field of

2838
02:01:13,780 --> 02:01:16,750
epigenetics which show that you can

2839
02:01:15,460 --> 02:01:18,910
actually transmit acquired

2840
02:01:16,750 --> 02:01:22,300
characteristics you know has really put

2841
02:01:18,910 --> 02:01:24,970
a whole real serious stick in the spokes

2842
02:01:22,300 --> 02:01:29,230
of the evolutionary bicycle let's say

2843
02:01:24,970 --> 02:01:32,050
but but then I also think the question

2844
02:01:29,230 --> 02:01:34,240
is miss asked in some sense because I

2845
02:01:32,050 --> 02:01:36,370
gave this lecture series a specific

2846
02:01:34,240 --> 02:01:38,500
title for a specific reason and the

2847
02:01:36,370 --> 02:01:40,930
lecture series is the psychological

2848
02:01:38,500 --> 02:01:43,870
significance of the biblical stories now

2849
02:01:40,930 --> 02:01:46,450
I'm not claiming that my psychological

2850
02:01:43,870 --> 02:01:49,350
analysis exhausts the significance of

2851
02:01:46,450 --> 02:01:52,450
the biblical stories you know they have

2852
02:01:49,350 --> 02:01:54,730
multitudes let's say layers of meaning

2853
02:01:52,450 --> 02:01:56,050
and some of those layers of metaphysical

2854
02:01:54,730 --> 02:01:58,510
and some of them are more specifically

2855
02:01:56,050 --> 02:02:00,820
religious and I'm trying the best I can

2856
02:01:58,510 --> 02:02:02,410
not to wander into those domains like I

2857
02:02:00,820 --> 02:02:04,900
do because it's impossible to keep

2858
02:02:02,410 --> 02:02:07,450
yourself bounded you know when you're a

2859
02:02:04,900 --> 02:02:09,700
discursive speaker let's say I'm trying

2860
02:02:07,450 --> 02:02:11,410
to what I'm trying to do is the sort of

2861
02:02:09,700 --> 02:02:12,880
thing that Jung did essentially is to

2862
02:02:11,410 --> 02:02:14,440
take a look at these old stories and say

2863
02:02:12,880 --> 02:02:16,780
okay well let's look at this from the

2864
02:02:14,440 --> 02:02:19,720
perspective of the human psyche and

2865
02:02:16,780 --> 02:02:22,270
let's see what the significance can be

2866
02:02:19,720 --> 02:02:24,610
and not to say that's all the

2867
02:02:22,270 --> 02:02:26,560
significance there is who knows what

2868
02:02:24,610 --> 02:02:28,270
significance there is one thing I have

2869
02:02:26,560 --> 02:02:30,490
learned about the biblical stories is

2870
02:02:28,270 --> 02:02:33,130
that no matter how deep you go into them

2871
02:02:30,490 --> 02:02:35,650
you are not at the bottom and so that's

2872
02:02:33,130 --> 02:02:37,980
been very very interesting to me and god

2873
02:02:35,650 --> 02:02:40,300
only knows about the metaphysical

2874
02:02:37,980 --> 02:02:41,619
substructure of reality because human

2875
02:02:40,300 --> 02:02:44,949
beings certainly don't

2876
02:02:41,619 --> 02:02:46,360
so I don't I don't want to claim that

2877
02:02:44,949 --> 02:02:47,800
what I'm doing is a religious

2878
02:02:46,360 --> 02:02:50,739
interpretation although you know it

2879
02:02:47,800 --> 02:02:53,080
drifts into that direction I want to

2880
02:02:50,739 --> 02:02:55,510
stay within the purview of my expertise

2881
02:02:53,080 --> 02:02:57,730
such as it is and to say well if you

2882
02:02:55,510 --> 02:03:01,170
look at this psychologically here's what

2883
02:02:57,730 --> 02:03:03,130
you can extract as as pragmatically

2884
02:03:01,170 --> 02:03:04,989
existentially and clinically meaningful

2885
02:03:03,130 --> 02:03:07,179
and the rest of it

2886
02:03:04,989 --> 02:03:11,070
well the rest of it has to be left in

2887
02:03:07,179 --> 02:03:14,739
advance and because I don't have the

2888
02:03:11,070 --> 02:03:17,469
capacity to investigate claims that go

2889
02:03:14,739 --> 02:03:20,050
beyond that that does not mean that I'm

2890
02:03:17,469 --> 02:03:22,449
saying that what I'm doing is reducing

2891
02:03:20,050 --> 02:03:24,130
these stories to their psychological

2892
02:03:22,449 --> 02:03:26,199
significance even though the psyche is a

2893
02:03:24,130 --> 02:03:29,290
grand thing I'm not trying to do that

2894
02:03:26,199 --> 02:03:32,469
it's not reductionistic it's a take on

2895
02:03:29,290 --> 02:03:34,270
it so people can make up their own minds

2896
02:03:32,469 --> 02:03:35,500
metaphysically and they also have to

2897
02:03:34,270 --> 02:03:37,449
make up their own minds about how

2898
02:03:35,500 --> 02:03:40,920
they're going to act which is really the

2899
02:03:37,449 --> 02:03:44,130
crucial issue as far as I'm concerned so

2900
02:03:40,920 --> 02:03:44,130
you bet

2901
02:03:48,159 --> 02:03:54,820
I I had a question with respect to daddy

2902
02:03:52,630 --> 02:03:56,679
presented I believe two weeks ago sorry

2903
02:03:54,820 --> 02:03:57,940
a question with respect to data even

2904
02:03:56,679 --> 02:04:01,870
presented I believe two lectures ago

2905
02:03:57,940 --> 02:04:04,330
regarding the use of psilocybin in

2906
02:04:01,870 --> 02:04:06,190
treatment of mental illness yes yes so

2907
02:04:04,330 --> 02:04:08,320
subsequently I looked up some of the

2908
02:04:06,190 --> 02:04:10,570
recently published a literature and one

2909
02:04:08,320 --> 02:04:12,520
yeah studies that I found extremely

2910
02:04:10,570 --> 02:04:14,770
striking was one that was published less

2911
02:04:12,520 --> 02:04:16,480
than a year ago in The Lancet which is a

2912
02:04:14,770 --> 02:04:18,790
very high-end yes

2913
02:04:16,480 --> 02:04:21,580
well respected journal yeah and what

2914
02:04:18,790 --> 02:04:24,850
they looked at was efficacy in patients

2915
02:04:21,580 --> 02:04:27,070
with severe treatment-resistant

2916
02:04:24,850 --> 02:04:30,520
depression and what they found is that

2917
02:04:27,070 --> 02:04:34,000
in 11 out of 12 of the patients they

2918
02:04:30,520 --> 02:04:36,940
showed significant remittance following

2919
02:04:34,000 --> 02:04:39,190
it a single dose of the substance up to

2920
02:04:36,940 --> 02:04:41,469
three months following the single dose

2921
02:04:39,190 --> 02:04:44,409
without additional dosing

2922
02:04:41,469 --> 02:04:47,290
so this not only substantiates I suppose

2923
02:04:44,409 --> 02:04:50,380
my own experiences but when you read

2924
02:04:47,290 --> 02:04:52,090
some of the commentary or review

2925
02:04:50,380 --> 02:04:54,760
articles surrounding these types of

2926
02:04:52,090 --> 02:04:57,310
topics not with respects to depression

2927
02:04:54,760 --> 02:05:01,060
but things like post-traumatic stress

2928
02:04:57,310 --> 02:05:03,280
disorder addiction they'll unequivocally

2929
02:05:01,060 --> 02:05:06,969
state that these types of results are

2930
02:05:03,280 --> 02:05:09,580
completely unprecedented and the realm

2931
02:05:06,969 --> 02:05:10,989
of psychiatric medicine yes so I was

2932
02:05:09,580 --> 02:05:13,480
wondering - good comment as to whether

2933
02:05:10,989 --> 02:05:17,260
or not that type of this rhetoric is

2934
02:05:13,480 --> 02:05:19,150
overblown and if not do you see these

2935
02:05:17,260 --> 02:05:22,330
being more mainstream in your future or

2936
02:05:19,150 --> 02:05:24,340
suspect they'll fall victim to something

2937
02:05:22,330 --> 02:05:27,190
along the lines of regulatory capture no

2938
02:05:24,340 --> 02:05:28,810
I don't well I don't think they're over

2939
02:05:27,190 --> 02:05:30,010
statements and I think I know some of

2940
02:05:28,810 --> 02:05:31,330
the people who are engaged in this

2941
02:05:30,010 --> 02:05:32,980
research and they're actually very

2942
02:05:31,330 --> 02:05:35,380
conservative people like their brave

2943
02:05:32,980 --> 02:05:36,909
people but I mean conservative in the

2944
02:05:35,380 --> 02:05:38,469
best sense you know they're not they're

2945
02:05:36,909 --> 02:05:40,239
not Timothy Leary yeah and I'm not

2946
02:05:38,469 --> 02:05:43,870
trying to put down Timothy Leary I'm

2947
02:05:40,239 --> 02:05:46,150
really not but you know some caution

2948
02:05:43,870 --> 02:05:49,900
would have been a good thing although

2949
02:05:46,150 --> 02:05:51,790
you know when something like when the

2950
02:05:49,900 --> 02:05:53,530
psychedelics burst onto the scene no one

2951
02:05:51,790 --> 02:05:56,139
had any idea what to do with them right

2952
02:05:53,530 --> 02:05:57,730
so and we still really don't but the new

2953
02:05:56,139 --> 02:05:59,980
research is being conducted very very

2954
02:05:57,730 --> 02:06:01,580
carefully but it is really remarkable

2955
02:05:59,980 --> 02:06:03,740
that those episodes

2956
02:06:01,580 --> 02:06:05,330
are used or those terms are used to

2957
02:06:03,740 --> 02:06:07,100
describe the results because those are

2958
02:06:05,330 --> 02:06:09,110
the lancet for example is one of the top

2959
02:06:07,100 --> 02:06:11,540
end medical journals

2960
02:06:09,110 --> 02:06:13,580
you don't see grand claims in The Lancet

2961
02:06:11,540 --> 02:06:15,890
right scientists don't write that way

2962
02:06:13,580 --> 02:06:18,590
there they're trained from the very

2963
02:06:15,890 --> 02:06:20,090
beginning to downplay their results but

2964
02:06:18,590 --> 02:06:22,030
they're quite struck by the fact that

2965
02:06:20,090 --> 02:06:25,130
these effects occur with single doses

2966
02:06:22,030 --> 02:06:27,530
now I think that what we don't know

2967
02:06:25,130 --> 02:06:30,110
about psychedelics could fill many many

2968
02:06:27,530 --> 02:06:32,090
many thick volumes and they're and

2969
02:06:30,110 --> 02:06:36,350
they're absolutely mysterious in their

2970
02:06:32,090 --> 02:06:38,390
function purpose effect consequence all

2971
02:06:36,350 --> 02:06:40,700
of that and I've always thought that it

2972
02:06:38,390 --> 02:06:42,590
was really appalling that we stopped

2973
02:06:40,700 --> 02:06:43,850
investigating them back in the 1960s

2974
02:06:42,590 --> 02:06:46,550
although it's not been that long you

2975
02:06:43,850 --> 02:06:50,720
know 20 years historically speaking it's

2976
02:06:46,550 --> 02:06:52,490
really nothing but and no I don't think

2977
02:06:50,720 --> 02:06:55,130
that there'll be that the research will

2978
02:06:52,490 --> 02:06:57,380
be stopped by regulatory capture because

2979
02:06:55,130 --> 02:06:59,060
the people who are doing it now I think

2980
02:06:57,380 --> 02:07:01,370
learned their lesson from what happened

2981
02:06:59,060 --> 02:07:04,130
in the 60s and are doing it pretty damn

2982
02:07:01,370 --> 02:07:06,500
carefully so we can hope that more

2983
02:07:04,130 --> 02:07:08,710
results like this are produced and that

2984
02:07:06,500 --> 02:07:15,610
they're replicable and that perhaps

2985
02:07:08,710 --> 02:07:15,610
they'll prove helpful with any luck yep

2986
02:07:19,880 --> 02:07:25,110
hi dr. Pederson I found this lecture

2987
02:07:22,980 --> 02:07:29,820
series really really enthralling and it

2988
02:07:25,110 --> 02:07:31,170
did why no I spent my time to explain

2989
02:07:29,820 --> 02:07:32,910
that I might answer the question

2990
02:07:31,170 --> 02:07:34,800
yeah that's okay all I'll get let you

2991
02:07:32,910 --> 02:07:38,040
get to the question but I'm curious like

2992
02:07:34,800 --> 02:07:40,110
what why do you think that is because

2993
02:07:38,040 --> 02:07:43,350
it's a strange thing to have happen like

2994
02:07:40,110 --> 02:07:45,240
it's a lecture on the Bible for God's

2995
02:07:43,350 --> 02:07:47,040
sake you know it's like it's not

2996
02:07:45,240 --> 02:07:49,530
something you'd go to a venture

2997
02:07:47,040 --> 02:07:51,840
capitalist with a business plan for so

2998
02:07:49,530 --> 02:07:53,850
like what what is it about it you think

2999
02:07:51,840 --> 02:07:55,280
that's been that that's had that effect

3000
02:07:53,850 --> 02:08:02,430
on you

3001
02:07:55,280 --> 02:08:03,810
ha I asked you a question instead look I

3002
02:08:02,430 --> 02:08:05,220
don't want to I don't want to put you on

3003
02:08:03,810 --> 02:08:06,510
the spot if you want to just move to

3004
02:08:05,220 --> 02:08:07,860
your question that's fine but if you

3005
02:08:06,510 --> 02:08:13,920
have an answer to that I would be very

3006
02:08:07,860 --> 02:08:20,760
interested in doing what it is well it's

3007
02:08:13,920 --> 02:08:23,760
it's a thrill to encounter a kind of

3008
02:08:20,760 --> 02:08:27,030
means to a metaphysical system that's so

3009
02:08:23,760 --> 02:08:29,190
persuasive and potent and I've hadn't

3010
02:08:27,030 --> 02:08:31,860
really experienced that a whole lot in

3011
02:08:29,190 --> 02:08:34,410
my life huh that's what universities are

3012
02:08:31,860 --> 02:08:36,000
supposed to do for people eh that's what

3013
02:08:34,410 --> 02:08:37,620
universities are supposed to do for

3014
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:39,090
people they're not supposed to take

3015
02:08:37,620 --> 02:08:41,220
people who are barely hanging together

3016
02:08:39,090 --> 02:08:44,010
and break them and make them weak

3017
02:08:41,220 --> 02:08:47,820
they're supposed to equate them with the

3018
02:08:44,010 --> 02:08:50,010
heroic the heroic sub structure of the

3019
02:08:47,820 --> 02:08:52,560
human psyche so that they can move out

3020
02:08:50,010 --> 02:08:54,750
into the world and thrive and it's an

3021
02:08:52,560 --> 02:08:57,160
absolute crime that isn't what's

3022
02:08:54,750 --> 02:09:04,380
happening so hooray for that

3023
02:08:57,160 --> 02:09:06,090
[Applause]

3024
02:09:04,380 --> 02:09:08,670
occurred to me that the kind of

3025
02:09:06,090 --> 02:09:13,830
tradition and genre that you are working

3026
02:09:08,670 --> 02:09:15,060
in here is that of this sermon now are

3027
02:09:13,830 --> 02:09:18,840
you comfortable with that categorization

3028
02:09:15,060 --> 02:09:21,510
and why or well see where you go with it

3029
02:09:18,840 --> 02:09:25,350
haha well that's the essence of my

3030
02:09:21,510 --> 02:09:27,600
question are these sermons and might no

3031
02:09:25,350 --> 02:09:29,160
one demo I don't know h er I don't know

3032
02:09:27,600 --> 02:09:31,860
you know sorry what was the last part

3033
02:09:29,160 --> 02:09:35,870
light one call you a preacher well you'd

3034
02:09:31,860 --> 02:09:39,420
certainly call me one and you know I

3035
02:09:35,870 --> 02:09:41,100
think that there's a certain overlap and

3036
02:09:39,420 --> 02:09:42,420
the overlap but this is being

3037
02:09:41,100 --> 02:09:43,650
characteristic of my approach to

3038
02:09:42,420 --> 02:09:45,390
education right from the beginning

3039
02:09:43,650 --> 02:09:48,480
because I have some rules about what I

3040
02:09:45,390 --> 02:09:50,070
lecture what about the topics that I

3041
02:09:48,480 --> 02:09:52,380
lecture about and the way that I deal

3042
02:09:50,070 --> 02:09:53,490
with it so the first rule is I don't

3043
02:09:52,380 --> 02:09:56,580
want to tell you anything that isn't

3044
02:09:53,490 --> 02:09:58,260
useful I'm a pragmatist you know like

3045
02:09:56,580 --> 02:10:00,900
I'm an American pragmatist that's part

3046
02:09:58,260 --> 02:10:03,030
of my philosophical grounding and I

3047
02:10:00,900 --> 02:10:05,880
believe that knowledge is tool like and

3048
02:10:03,030 --> 02:10:08,430
that the proper thing to do is to to

3049
02:10:05,880 --> 02:10:11,010
equip people with the tools to move

3050
02:10:08,430 --> 02:10:14,490
effectively in the world and so I want

3051
02:10:11,010 --> 02:10:16,560
to make sure that if I offer a story or

3052
02:10:14,490 --> 02:10:18,360
a fact for that matter I also say well

3053
02:10:16,560 --> 02:10:20,580
here here's why you need to know this

3054
02:10:18,360 --> 02:10:22,800
fact it will actually improve your life

3055
02:10:20,580 --> 02:10:24,330
or it'll stop you from wandering into a

3056
02:10:22,800 --> 02:10:27,300
pit which is approximately the same

3057
02:10:24,330 --> 02:10:29,220
thing and then it will also knowing this

3058
02:10:27,300 --> 02:10:30,840
will also make you more effective actor

3059
02:10:29,220 --> 02:10:32,640
in the social world and that will

3060
02:10:30,840 --> 02:10:33,780
improve the social world right and

3061
02:10:32,640 --> 02:10:36,480
hopefully that will improve the

3062
02:10:33,780 --> 02:10:39,300
environmental world etc etc and so I

3063
02:10:36,480 --> 02:10:41,190
would say to the degree that those who

3064
02:10:39,300 --> 02:10:43,380
produce sermons are concerned with

3065
02:10:41,190 --> 02:10:46,320
producing alterations in behavior which

3066
02:10:43,380 --> 02:10:48,360
is our moral alterations say then I

3067
02:10:46,320 --> 02:10:49,980
share the same territory with them but I

3068
02:10:48,360 --> 02:10:51,930
wouldn't say that that's something that

3069
02:10:49,980 --> 02:10:54,000
should be only relegated to the domain

3070
02:10:51,930 --> 02:10:55,650
of the sermon because I believe that it

3071
02:10:54,000 --> 02:10:57,560
is the job of the universities for

3072
02:10:55,650 --> 02:11:01,260
example especially in the damned

3073
02:10:57,560 --> 02:11:03,840
humanities to ennoble people and to

3074
02:11:01,260 --> 02:11:06,270
enable them to adopt the mantle of

3075
02:11:03,840 --> 02:11:08,730
proper citizenship and that we've

3076
02:11:06,270 --> 02:11:11,220
forgotten that we've forgotten that or

3077
02:11:08,730 --> 02:11:13,739
we're avoiding it or refusing it or

3078
02:11:11,220 --> 02:11:15,480
something like that you know and I think

3079
02:11:13,739 --> 02:11:18,750
we're using the death of God as an

3080
02:11:15,480 --> 02:11:21,030
excuse so I think that to the degree

3081
02:11:18,750 --> 02:11:23,390
that I'm a preacher I'm making an error

3082
02:11:21,030 --> 02:11:25,710
you know and also to the degree that I'm

3083
02:11:23,390 --> 02:11:27,780
politicized I'm making an error I'm

3084
02:11:25,710 --> 02:11:30,120
wandering out of my proper territory

3085
02:11:27,780 --> 02:11:32,730
when that's the domain that I'm in but

3086
02:11:30,120 --> 02:11:36,030
when I'm attempting to assemble multiple

3087
02:11:32,730 --> 02:11:38,010
layers of facts towards a practical end

3088
02:11:36,030 --> 02:11:39,930
which is what I'm trying to do and the

3089
02:11:38,010 --> 02:11:42,450
end is the the annulment of the

3090
02:11:39,930 --> 02:11:44,760
individual right that's my goal then

3091
02:11:42,450 --> 02:11:46,080
then I'm in my proper domain I'm going

3092
02:11:44,760 --> 02:11:48,360
to make mistakes you know I'm going to

3093
02:11:46,080 --> 02:11:51,390
wander out of my territory and I try not

3094
02:11:48,360 --> 02:11:52,800
to do that but you know it's well it's

3095
02:11:51,390 --> 02:11:55,739
part of being a fool you're going to

3096
02:11:52,800 --> 02:12:04,710
make mistakes so yeah thanks very much

3097
02:11:55,739 --> 02:12:06,180
no problem doc thanks for continuing to

3098
02:12:04,710 --> 02:12:07,800
do all the cool stuff that makes

3099
02:12:06,180 --> 02:12:10,140
everyone love you that's great

3100
02:12:07,800 --> 02:12:12,330
not everyone well uh yeah yeah yeah

3101
02:12:10,140 --> 02:12:14,880
that's a generalization there's lots of

3102
02:12:12,330 --> 02:12:17,210
people that seem not to love me yeah and

3103
02:12:14,880 --> 02:12:19,020
I can't blame him really

3104
02:12:17,210 --> 02:12:21,180
anyway yeah I'm going to lead into a

3105
02:12:19,020 --> 02:12:26,280
question here so him in your book maps

3106
02:12:21,180 --> 02:12:28,850
and rare book maps of meaning uh I got

3107
02:12:26,280 --> 02:12:32,580
that quote from Dostoevsky about how

3108
02:12:28,850 --> 02:12:35,610
humankind mankind - given all the cakes

3109
02:12:32,580 --> 02:12:37,290
in the world yet oh my god so yeah if

3110
02:12:35,610 --> 02:12:39,690
you get oh my god is right man that's

3111
02:12:37,290 --> 02:12:41,580
one killer quote that's from notes from

3112
02:12:39,690 --> 02:12:43,680
the underground eh everyone should read

3113
02:12:41,580 --> 02:12:45,719
that because everyone's underground and

3114
02:12:43,680 --> 02:12:48,780
it's a great it's a great little journey

3115
02:12:45,719 --> 02:12:51,060
through that yeah so it's basically as

3116
02:12:48,780 --> 02:12:53,400
you give if you have the perfect utopia

3117
02:12:51,060 --> 02:12:57,719
I often use it basically if you have

3118
02:12:53,400 --> 02:12:59,730
your most perfect utopia humans will

3119
02:12:57,719 --> 02:13:00,960
find a way to screw it up yeah it'll go

3120
02:12:59,730 --> 02:13:02,670
out of the way I do at least yeah

3121
02:13:00,960 --> 02:13:04,260
because it's what we like we like chaos

3122
02:13:02,670 --> 02:13:06,090
and the unknown just talked about this

3123
02:13:04,260 --> 02:13:08,910
yeah that's the thing is is that we're

3124
02:13:06,090 --> 02:13:09,810
heroic adventurers right we're not we're

3125
02:13:08,910 --> 02:13:11,550
not Sybarite

3126
02:13:09,810 --> 02:13:13,320
laying on a beach although when you get

3127
02:13:11,550 --> 02:13:14,910
the opportunity to do that like make

3128
02:13:13,320 --> 02:13:16,860
sure you take it but that's that's not

3129
02:13:14,910 --> 02:13:18,900
what that's not that's not the proper

3130
02:13:16,860 --> 02:13:20,850
calling of the human soul right we're

3131
02:13:18,900 --> 02:13:23,040
out there to conquer chaos and the

3132
02:13:20,850 --> 02:13:25,020
unknown and it's in that we find meaning

3133
02:13:23,040 --> 02:13:26,569
and that's better than the utopia that's

3134
02:13:25,020 --> 02:13:29,149
what Dostoyevsky

3135
02:13:26,569 --> 02:13:31,280
god bless his soul Dostoyevsky had that

3136
02:13:29,149 --> 02:13:33,379
he was such a genius he had everything

3137
02:13:31,280 --> 02:13:35,679
that was wrong with communism figured

3138
02:13:33,379 --> 02:13:38,479
out even before it started

3139
02:13:35,679 --> 02:13:40,609
amazing really like if you read the

3140
02:13:38,479 --> 02:13:42,019
possessed or the devil's which I would

3141
02:13:40,609 --> 02:13:43,309
highly recommend although it's a hard

3142
02:13:42,019 --> 02:13:46,429
book to get into it takes about a

3143
02:13:43,309 --> 02:13:47,059
hundred pages to really get get it get

3144
02:13:46,429 --> 02:13:49,879
moving

3145
02:13:47,059 --> 02:13:53,179
but Dostoyevsky talks his main character

3146
02:13:49,879 --> 02:13:54,979
in that novel is a person who's again a

3147
02:13:53,179 --> 02:13:56,689
very powerful person who's completely

3148
02:13:54,979 --> 02:13:58,309
possessed by what's essentially the

3149
02:13:56,689 --> 02:14:00,010
communist ideology and he's very

3150
02:13:58,309 --> 02:14:02,839
effective at moving it forward and

3151
02:14:00,010 --> 02:14:04,459
Dostoyevsky lays out brilliantly exactly

3152
02:14:02,839 --> 02:14:06,319
the catastrophic consequences of that

3153
02:14:04,459 --> 02:14:07,699
both personally and socially and he did

3154
02:14:06,319 --> 02:14:09,499
this like thirty years before the

3155
02:14:07,699 --> 02:14:11,869
Russian Revolution it's just it's

3156
02:14:09,499 --> 02:14:14,539
uncanny I don't know where the hell that

3157
02:14:11,869 --> 02:14:17,089
guy was from must have been his epilepsy

3158
02:14:14,539 --> 02:14:20,510
you know so yeah I'm glad I got y'all

3159
02:14:17,089 --> 02:14:22,879
excited him keep going here basically I

3160
02:14:20,510 --> 02:14:24,379
used to use that you know it's kind of

3161
02:14:22,879 --> 02:14:25,879
late that a lot of that comes from the

3162
02:14:24,379 --> 02:14:28,969
left-wing this utopia we're going

3163
02:14:25,879 --> 02:14:30,260
towards with the universal income and

3164
02:14:28,969 --> 02:14:32,179
the AI and suddenly the whole

3165
02:14:30,260 --> 02:14:34,819
populations can become insanely creative

3166
02:14:32,179 --> 02:14:36,919
and with no incentives but it's not that

3167
02:14:34,819 --> 02:14:38,269
utopia is not there it's not like this

3168
02:14:36,919 --> 02:14:40,849
thing that hasn't happened yet we're in

3169
02:14:38,269 --> 02:14:43,069
it we're in it this is the best thing

3170
02:14:40,849 --> 02:14:44,929
ever and like all of humanity the

3171
02:14:43,069 --> 02:14:47,749
Western civilization like oh my god

3172
02:14:44,929 --> 02:14:50,179
putting the material sense I mean oh

3173
02:14:47,749 --> 02:14:55,819
it's just toilet paper toilet paper it

3174
02:14:50,179 --> 02:15:02,689
just happened anyway that's so serious

3175
02:14:55,819 --> 02:15:05,479
like so we have this beautiful thing and

3176
02:15:02,689 --> 02:15:07,579
people are trying to take it down at all

3177
02:15:05,479 --> 02:15:09,709
cost and and now we go into the dark

3178
02:15:07,579 --> 02:15:12,039
phase of my into my question here which

3179
02:15:09,709 --> 02:15:16,280
is and it actually goes into

3180
02:15:12,039 --> 02:15:18,799
Charlottesville had you know with with

3181
02:15:16,280 --> 02:15:22,849
that with with the initial purpose of

3182
02:15:18,799 --> 02:15:24,559
protecting the statue was a good thing I

3183
02:15:22,849 --> 02:15:27,409
don't I'm not I don't know about

3184
02:15:24,559 --> 02:15:30,589
Confederacy except for the big thing but

3185
02:15:27,409 --> 02:15:33,829
honestly it's a it's a slippery slippery

3186
02:15:30,589 --> 02:15:36,709
slope and the confused souls who in the

3187
02:15:33,829 --> 02:15:40,170
bad make this darkened souls for sure

3188
02:15:36,709 --> 02:15:42,600
not good they screwed up big-time

3189
02:15:40,170 --> 02:15:45,120
the purpose behind it it's so important

3190
02:15:42,600 --> 02:15:46,920
because it's going to be fought founding

3191
02:15:45,120 --> 02:15:48,840
fathers next anyone who ever contributed

3192
02:15:46,920 --> 02:15:50,610
to anything to Western civilization as

3193
02:15:48,840 --> 02:15:53,130
we know it is already being it's already

3194
02:15:50,610 --> 02:15:55,020
being done James Madison High School in

3195
02:15:53,130 --> 02:15:57,360
the States it's getting renamed because

3196
02:15:55,020 --> 02:16:00,630
some girls one of the students felt

3197
02:15:57,360 --> 02:16:03,120
unsafe and so yeah this is a serious

3198
02:16:00,630 --> 02:16:05,100
issue I wanted like I feel like we're

3199
02:16:03,120 --> 02:16:07,530
really up against the wall now because

3200
02:16:05,100 --> 02:16:09,870
now they found their Nazis man the Nazis

3201
02:16:07,530 --> 02:16:12,540
are flooding the streets now so how do

3202
02:16:09,870 --> 02:16:25,110
we how do we possibly you know kind of

3203
02:16:12,540 --> 02:16:35,280
save our cakes you had to bring it up

3204
02:16:25,110 --> 02:16:37,320
didn't you well having the right

3205
02:16:35,280 --> 02:16:39,540
degenerated to the identity politics

3206
02:16:37,320 --> 02:16:41,460
does not seem to be a positive solution

3207
02:16:39,540 --> 02:16:45,210
so one of the things I would say is that

3208
02:16:41,460 --> 02:16:46,801
like I understand why the identity

3209
02:16:45,210 --> 02:16:49,410
politics that has been practiced so

3210
02:16:46,801 --> 02:16:52,770
assiduously and so devastatingly by the

3211
02:16:49,410 --> 02:16:55,350
left has been co-opted by the right I

3212
02:16:52,770 --> 02:16:57,420
understand that but then here's what I

3213
02:16:55,350 --> 02:17:01,051
would say to the people on the right who

3214
02:16:57,420 --> 02:17:04,140
are playing that game if you play the

3215
02:17:01,051 --> 02:17:06,720
game of your enemies and you win you win

3216
02:17:04,140 --> 02:17:09,690
their game you don't win

3217
02:17:06,720 --> 02:17:11,310
that's not victory you just become the

3218
02:17:09,690 --> 02:17:14,850
most successful exponent of their

3219
02:17:11,310 --> 02:17:18,301
pathology how is that a good thing it's

3220
02:17:14,850 --> 02:17:20,220
a bad thing so what does that leave

3221
02:17:18,301 --> 02:17:25,350
people as although as an alternative

3222
02:17:20,220 --> 02:17:28,580
well I don't think that the Caucasians

3223
02:17:25,350 --> 02:17:30,690
let's say should revert to being white I

3224
02:17:28,580 --> 02:17:33,570
think that's a bad idea

3225
02:17:30,690 --> 02:17:36,440
it's a dangerous idea and it's coming

3226
02:17:33,570 --> 02:17:40,400
fast and I don't like to see that I

3227
02:17:36,440 --> 02:17:43,290
think the whole group identity thing is

3228
02:17:40,400 --> 02:17:46,200
seriously pathological I think we've

3229
02:17:43,290 --> 02:17:47,790
made big mistakes in Canada I understand

3230
02:17:46,200 --> 02:17:50,490
why at least to some degree in that

3231
02:17:47,790 --> 02:17:51,870
respect and that large mistakes are

3232
02:17:50,490 --> 02:17:53,730
being made all over the Western world

3233
02:17:51,870 --> 02:17:56,640
where we're making you

3234
02:17:53,730 --> 02:17:57,540
group identity the most important thing

3235
02:17:56,640 --> 02:18:00,990
about you

3236
02:17:57,540 --> 02:18:02,671
I think that's reprehensible I think

3237
02:18:00,990 --> 02:18:04,680
it's devastating

3238
02:18:02,671 --> 02:18:06,421
I think it's genocide 'el in its

3239
02:18:04,680 --> 02:18:09,030
ultimate expression I think it will

3240
02:18:06,421 --> 02:18:13,770
bring down our civilization if we pursue

3241
02:18:09,030 --> 02:18:15,360
it we shouldn't be playing that game so

3242
02:18:13,770 --> 02:18:16,980
what's the alternative you know I've

3243
02:18:15,360 --> 02:18:19,650
thought for a long time about a

3244
02:18:16,980 --> 02:18:22,350
political career really forever since I

3245
02:18:19,650 --> 02:18:25,020
was like 12 really for a long time and

3246
02:18:22,350 --> 02:18:27,990
I've always decided against it because

3247
02:18:25,020 --> 02:18:30,600
it seemed to me that the proper level of

3248
02:18:27,990 --> 02:18:32,280
analysis with regards to the solution of

3249
02:18:30,600 --> 02:18:33,961
the problem that we're facing isn't

3250
02:18:32,280 --> 02:18:36,180
political and that's why I think it's a

3251
02:18:33,961 --> 02:18:37,980
mistake when what I'm doing gets

3252
02:18:36,180 --> 02:18:40,860
politicized either by me or others I

3253
02:18:37,980 --> 02:18:43,110
think that the way that you deal with

3254
02:18:40,860 --> 02:18:45,631
this is to put yourself together I

3255
02:18:43,110 --> 02:18:47,190
really believe that is that because I

3256
02:18:45,631 --> 02:18:48,720
think that individual people are far

3257
02:18:47,190 --> 02:18:50,341
more powerful they're certainly far more

3258
02:18:48,720 --> 02:18:52,080
evil than they're willing to consider

3259
02:18:50,341 --> 02:18:56,131
but that's also a sign of their

3260
02:18:52,080 --> 02:18:59,671
unbelievable power so I think that what

3261
02:18:56,131 --> 02:19:02,310
you do is you aim high and put yourself

3262
02:18:59,671 --> 02:19:04,650
together and stay the hell away from the

3263
02:19:02,310 --> 02:19:06,870
ideologues because they're hiding

3264
02:19:04,650 --> 02:19:08,730
they're hiding behind a wall they're not

3265
02:19:06,870 --> 02:19:12,180
able to come out and fight on their own

3266
02:19:08,730 --> 02:19:14,040
behalf and so the way forward through

3267
02:19:12,180 --> 02:19:16,381
the ideological mess and that's the

3268
02:19:14,040 --> 02:19:18,841
lesson of Western culture is to place

3269
02:19:16,381 --> 02:19:20,461
the individual at the place of paramount

3270
02:19:18,841 --> 02:19:24,140
importance and to make the group

3271
02:19:20,461 --> 02:19:25,320
identity emerge only when necessary and

3272
02:19:24,140 --> 02:19:28,830
secondarily

3273
02:19:25,320 --> 02:19:30,330
if ever and so you can do that you can

3274
02:19:28,830 --> 02:19:32,190
do that now you can do that tomorrow

3275
02:19:30,330 --> 02:19:34,290
like you can put your life together and

3276
02:19:32,190 --> 02:19:36,510
again as I mentioned to the other young

3277
02:19:34,290 --> 02:19:39,330
men who asked the question is you won't

3278
02:19:36,510 --> 02:19:41,520
hurt anyone doing that right you pick up

3279
02:19:39,330 --> 02:19:44,100
your goddamn responsibilities sort

3280
02:19:41,520 --> 02:19:46,110
yourself oke fix up your family right

3281
02:19:44,100 --> 02:19:47,881
and then you can be a force for good in

3282
02:19:46,110 --> 02:19:50,221
the culture and if enough people do that

3283
02:19:47,881 --> 02:19:52,530
the ideological mess will just evaporate

3284
02:19:50,221 --> 02:19:53,940
it'll just disappear I think that's the

3285
02:19:52,530 --> 02:19:56,700
way you show people the right path

3286
02:19:53,940 --> 02:19:59,011
forward to is that you say well look um

3287
02:19:56,700 --> 02:20:00,931
we would like we would like it so much

3288
02:19:59,011 --> 02:20:04,021
if you could thrive as an individual

3289
02:20:00,931 --> 02:20:06,511
drop your cult-like affiliation right

3290
02:20:04,021 --> 02:20:07,561
step out of the shadows the demonic

3291
02:20:06,511 --> 02:20:10,200
shadows you

3292
02:20:07,561 --> 02:20:12,570
ideological possession and step forward

3293
02:20:10,200 --> 02:20:15,211
as a fully developed person into the

3294
02:20:12,570 --> 02:20:18,780
light do it by example

3295
02:20:15,211 --> 02:20:22,251
that's your that's your best bet man so

3296
02:20:18,780 --> 02:20:22,251
that's what it looks like to me

3297
02:20:30,820 --> 02:20:35,840
I'm going to take one more question and

3298
02:20:33,260 --> 02:20:38,300
then I'm going to there is a young man

3299
02:20:35,840 --> 02:20:42,260
from Kentucky here Brian

3300
02:20:38,300 --> 02:20:43,939
it's Brian here ok so I'm going to

3301
02:20:42,260 --> 02:20:47,990
answer one more question and I'm going

3302
02:20:43,939 --> 02:20:49,700
to let you take Mike okay all right good

3303
02:20:47,990 --> 02:20:50,300
evening dr. Peterson good evening

3304
02:20:49,700 --> 02:20:52,880
everybody

3305
02:20:50,300 --> 02:20:54,590
I also want to thank you first for your

3306
02:20:52,880 --> 02:20:57,320
lectures that I've been following on

3307
02:20:54,590 --> 02:20:59,990
YouTube mainly and to say that they have

3308
02:20:57,320 --> 02:21:03,979
been well life changing wouldn't be an

3309
02:20:59,990 --> 02:21:06,050
overstatement great and I'm one of the

3310
02:21:03,979 --> 02:21:08,300
crazy people increasing your views on

3311
02:21:06,050 --> 02:21:16,550
YouTube because I flew in from Belgium

3312
02:21:08,300 --> 02:21:18,800
last night to be here and and it's like

3313
02:21:16,550 --> 02:21:20,890
3 a.m. for me right now

3314
02:21:18,800 --> 02:21:23,689
and English is not my first language so

3315
02:21:20,890 --> 02:21:27,830
bear with me

3316
02:21:23,689 --> 02:21:29,810
I I would have many burning questions to

3317
02:21:27,830 --> 02:21:33,140
ask you but I thought it was fair and

3318
02:21:29,810 --> 02:21:35,330
necessary to pick one and it would be

3319
02:21:33,140 --> 02:21:38,000
this one there are concepts that recur

3320
02:21:35,330 --> 02:21:39,859
in your lectures with this one you only

3321
02:21:38,000 --> 02:21:42,040
mentioned once in your early videos on

3322
02:21:39,859 --> 02:21:44,570
Bill c16

3323
02:21:42,040 --> 02:21:46,790
about self-esteem you said you don't

3324
02:21:44,570 --> 02:21:48,680
believe in the existence of self-esteem

3325
02:21:46,790 --> 02:21:50,810
the way to teach children they're all

3326
02:21:48,680 --> 02:21:53,300
special you think you boost their

3327
02:21:50,810 --> 02:21:56,300
confidence but the only result is that

3328
02:21:53,300 --> 02:21:58,640
some get a narcissistic the reason why

3329
02:21:56,300 --> 02:21:59,660
I'm interested in that is about standing

3330
02:21:58,640 --> 02:22:07,760
up for yourself

3331
02:21:59,660 --> 02:22:13,280
and it is and when I try to you know do

3332
02:22:07,760 --> 02:22:16,370
it yeah I see that rational argument

3333
02:22:13,280 --> 02:22:19,460
facing rationality doesn't get the best

3334
02:22:16,370 --> 02:22:22,030
result in negotiations that's why you

3335
02:22:19,460 --> 02:22:25,189
learn how to be socialized by playing

3336
02:22:22,030 --> 02:22:27,649
rough and tumble it's not an

3337
02:22:25,189 --> 02:22:30,410
intellectual conversation that gets you

3338
02:22:27,649 --> 02:22:33,050
socialized so I'm also reading that book

3339
02:22:30,410 --> 02:22:35,450
suggested about by Stephen Hicks

3340
02:22:33,050 --> 02:22:37,220
explaining of modernism yes I wasn't

3341
02:22:35,450 --> 02:22:39,170
really familiar and I've been listening

3342
02:22:37,220 --> 02:22:41,750
to a lot of talk to him later this week

3343
02:22:39,170 --> 02:22:43,740
so that might be fun and I'm trying to

3344
02:22:41,750 --> 02:22:45,931
read with fresh eyes because

3345
02:22:43,740 --> 02:22:48,900
having it doctrine aided by you of

3346
02:22:45,931 --> 02:22:53,251
course very critical and there's one

3347
02:22:48,900 --> 02:22:55,261
more point that I have to agree with the

3348
02:22:53,251 --> 02:22:57,961
postmodernist and that is the world

3349
02:22:55,261 --> 02:23:01,411
seems to me as I observe it a place

3350
02:22:57,961 --> 02:23:04,320
where powers are at play it's not

3351
02:23:01,411 --> 02:23:06,721
rationality delete that so when I'm in a

3352
02:23:04,320 --> 02:23:09,780
weak position and I want to fight back

3353
02:23:06,721 --> 02:23:12,690
not to get resentful I find that it's

3354
02:23:09,780 --> 02:23:14,280
not a rational argument that will get me

3355
02:23:12,690 --> 02:23:16,171
there there's something else that I

3356
02:23:14,280 --> 02:23:18,900
don't do and that I should be doing and

3357
02:23:16,171 --> 02:23:21,121
I don't know what it is so you see the

3358
02:23:18,900 --> 02:23:22,730
relation with self-esteem seems to me

3359
02:23:21,121 --> 02:23:26,820
that people who think of themselves

3360
02:23:22,730 --> 02:23:30,030
start in a better position in this game

3361
02:23:26,820 --> 02:23:32,041
ok so ok ok great yeah alright so

3362
02:23:30,030 --> 02:23:34,501
there's a lot in that question so the

3363
02:23:32,041 --> 02:23:36,450
first thing is is there's a problem with

3364
02:23:34,501 --> 02:23:38,671
the measurement of self-esteem and that

3365
02:23:36,450 --> 02:23:40,891
actually matters because self-esteem is

3366
02:23:38,671 --> 02:23:42,990
a psychological concept a scientific

3367
02:23:40,891 --> 02:23:44,610
concept if you like and you have to get

3368
02:23:42,990 --> 02:23:46,621
the measurement right and you can

3369
02:23:44,610 --> 02:23:48,181
predict self-esteem almost perfectly by

3370
02:23:46,621 --> 02:23:51,570
measuring someone's extraversion

3371
02:23:48,181 --> 02:23:53,431
and subtracting from that their negative

3372
02:23:51,570 --> 02:23:55,171
emotionality or neuroticism so it's

3373
02:23:53,431 --> 02:23:57,271
actually just a combination of big five

3374
02:23:55,171 --> 02:23:59,610
traits and so people who are extroverted

3375
02:23:57,271 --> 02:24:02,131
who feel a lot of positive emotion and

3376
02:23:59,610 --> 02:24:04,740
who are and who don't feel a lot of

3377
02:24:02,131 --> 02:24:05,480
negative emotion score high on scales of

3378
02:24:04,740 --> 02:24:10,351
self-esteem

3379
02:24:05,480 --> 02:24:13,171
ok so conceptually it's a non-starter

3380
02:24:10,351 --> 02:24:15,751
because you're not going to move

3381
02:24:13,171 --> 02:24:17,730
people's levels of neuroticism let's say

3382
02:24:15,751 --> 02:24:18,480
by trying to get them to feel good about

3383
02:24:17,730 --> 02:24:21,780
themselves

3384
02:24:18,480 --> 02:24:24,541
ok now having said that that doesn't

3385
02:24:21,780 --> 02:24:28,110
mean that you shouldn't encourage people

3386
02:24:24,541 --> 02:24:30,240
right now there's this psychologist

3387
02:24:28,110 --> 02:24:32,190
named Jerome Kagan who's quite a great

3388
02:24:30,240 --> 02:24:34,561
psychologist developmental psychologist

3389
02:24:32,190 --> 02:24:38,131
I think he's emeritus at Harvard at the

3390
02:24:34,561 --> 02:24:41,131
at the at the moment he studied temper

3391
02:24:38,131 --> 02:24:43,110
mentally inhibited children you can so

3392
02:24:41,131 --> 02:24:44,551
they're basically kids who are high in

3393
02:24:43,110 --> 02:24:47,190
neuroticism probably low and

3394
02:24:44,551 --> 02:24:48,811
extraversion and he found that if those

3395
02:24:47,190 --> 02:24:50,521
chilled and you can identify them as

3396
02:24:48,811 --> 02:24:54,150
early as six months right it's very very

3397
02:24:50,521 --> 02:24:56,400
inculcated in their temperament he found

3398
02:24:54,150 --> 02:24:57,510
that if you encouraged them in the world

3399
02:24:56,400 --> 02:24:59,520
you could shift

3400
02:24:57,510 --> 02:25:01,979
them into a more stable personality

3401
02:24:59,520 --> 02:25:04,200
configuration and what you basically did

3402
02:25:01,979 --> 02:25:06,779
was when they were manifesting signs of

3403
02:25:04,200 --> 02:25:09,330
distress instead of encouraging them to

3404
02:25:06,779 --> 02:25:12,210
withdraw and retreat which is what they

3405
02:25:09,330 --> 02:25:14,040
might be attempting to do you encourage

3406
02:25:12,210 --> 02:25:15,330
them to go out and explore so for

3407
02:25:14,040 --> 02:25:16,500
example if you have a temper mentally

3408
02:25:15,330 --> 02:25:18,479
inhibited child and you go to a

3409
02:25:16,500 --> 02:25:20,160
playground and there's kids out there

3410
02:25:18,479 --> 02:25:23,580
like you have an extroverted emotionally

3411
02:25:20,160 --> 02:25:25,290
stable kid three years old as you put

3412
02:25:23,580 --> 02:25:27,510
them on the ground their feet are

3413
02:25:25,290 --> 02:25:29,399
already moving right like a puppy over

3414
02:25:27,510 --> 02:25:31,740
water and you let them go and they just

3415
02:25:29,399 --> 02:25:33,569
run to the to the kids and they're there

3416
02:25:31,740 --> 02:25:34,920
and then you have to drag them away but

3417
02:25:33,569 --> 02:25:36,270
if you have a temper mentally inhibited

3418
02:25:34,920 --> 02:25:37,859
child the child will sort of stand

3419
02:25:36,270 --> 02:25:41,729
around your legs and sort of peek out

3420
02:25:37,859 --> 02:25:44,520
you know and then what you do is wait it

3421
02:25:41,729 --> 02:25:46,500
out let them watch encourage them to

3422
02:25:44,520 --> 02:25:48,240
move a little bit forward encourage them

3423
02:25:46,500 --> 02:25:51,689
to take their steps out into the unknown

3424
02:25:48,240 --> 02:25:53,430
and the strange land and don't let them

3425
02:25:51,689 --> 02:25:55,080
withdraw like you can do it you have

3426
02:25:53,430 --> 02:25:56,850
they're slower to warm up they'll warm

3427
02:25:55,080 --> 02:25:59,340
up they'll habituate and if you

3428
02:25:56,850 --> 02:26:02,520
continually expose your inhibited child

3429
02:25:59,340 --> 02:26:04,680
to the things that make them anxious in

3430
02:26:02,520 --> 02:26:06,479
measured doses then you can transform

3431
02:26:04,680 --> 02:26:08,100
their psychophysiological temperament

3432
02:26:06,479 --> 02:26:09,720
now you're probably not going to shift

3433
02:26:08,100 --> 02:26:12,420
them way the hell out onto the

3434
02:26:09,720 --> 02:26:13,979
extroverted emotionally stable end but

3435
02:26:12,420 --> 02:26:15,750
you can make a big difference that's

3436
02:26:13,979 --> 02:26:18,439
very different than making them feel

3437
02:26:15,750 --> 02:26:21,660
good about themselves which is such a

3438
02:26:18,439 --> 02:26:25,590
you need to curse you need to curse when

3439
02:26:21,660 --> 02:26:27,660
you discuss that concept right so it

3440
02:26:25,590 --> 02:26:29,640
isn't the improved their self-esteem it

3441
02:26:27,660 --> 02:26:32,010
isn't how you feel about yourself right

3442
02:26:29,640 --> 02:26:33,450
it's how you act effectively in the

3443
02:26:32,010 --> 02:26:36,600
world and how you're trained to do that

3444
02:26:33,450 --> 02:26:38,819
so okay now then you were talking about

3445
02:26:36,600 --> 02:26:40,380
negotiation right and you said well

3446
02:26:38,819 --> 02:26:41,609
don't you said something like don't

3447
02:26:40,380 --> 02:26:44,040
people who feel good about themselves

3448
02:26:41,609 --> 02:26:46,470
aren't they able to negotiate better and

3449
02:26:44,040 --> 02:26:50,189
it's I know that's a poor paraphrase

3450
02:26:46,470 --> 02:26:52,680
excuse me but negotiation is actually a

3451
02:26:50,189 --> 02:26:54,029
practical issue to some degree like the

3452
02:26:52,680 --> 02:26:55,830
first thing is that you have to figure

3453
02:26:54,029 --> 02:26:57,300
out what you want because you were

3454
02:26:55,830 --> 02:26:58,950
saying well it's not merely rational

3455
02:26:57,300 --> 02:27:00,420
it's like yeah yeah that's for sure you

3456
02:26:58,950 --> 02:27:03,630
have to bargain from a position of

3457
02:27:00,420 --> 02:27:05,310
authority let's say not power Authority

3458
02:27:03,630 --> 02:27:06,660
is a better word but you don't have

3459
02:27:05,310 --> 02:27:08,250
authority unless you know what you're

3460
02:27:06,660 --> 02:27:11,440
talking about and unless you can bring

3461
02:27:08,250 --> 02:27:13,480
some unless you can bring some

3462
02:27:11,440 --> 02:27:17,291
let's say force it's not that's not the

3463
02:27:13,480 --> 02:27:20,741
right word you can negotiate without

3464
02:27:17,291 --> 02:27:22,061
anyone unless you can say no and you

3465
02:27:20,741 --> 02:27:24,611
can't say no unless you've set yourself

3466
02:27:22,061 --> 02:27:26,351
up with alternatives so when you go to

3467
02:27:24,611 --> 02:27:28,511
your boss and you negotiate for a raise

3468
02:27:26,351 --> 02:27:30,431
you need to have the sort of CV that

3469
02:27:28,511 --> 02:27:32,351
enables you to go find another job and

3470
02:27:30,431 --> 02:27:33,821
you have to have your CV prepared and

3471
02:27:32,351 --> 02:27:35,891
you have to have looked for another job

3472
02:27:33,821 --> 02:27:38,281
and you have to be able to get one

3473
02:27:35,891 --> 02:27:41,021
because then you can go in there and say

3474
02:27:38,281 --> 02:27:43,391
I'm not as productive as I could be at

3475
02:27:41,021 --> 02:27:45,400
my current level of remuneration it's

3476
02:27:43,391 --> 02:27:47,831
not reflective of what I'm able to do

3477
02:27:45,400 --> 02:27:49,361
and I want this and this is what will

3478
02:27:47,831 --> 02:27:50,531
happen if you give me this this would be

3479
02:27:49,361 --> 02:27:53,201
the good things that will happen and

3480
02:27:50,531 --> 02:27:55,841
what do you think of that and the person

3481
02:27:53,201 --> 02:27:57,371
is going to know even by the way that

3482
02:27:55,841 --> 02:27:59,051
you hold yourself while you're having

3483
02:27:57,371 --> 02:28:01,271
the discussion whether or not you're

3484
02:27:59,051 --> 02:28:03,940
someone with options and you can't fake

3485
02:28:01,271 --> 02:28:05,891
that well you can but it's not helpful

3486
02:28:03,940 --> 02:28:08,801
like it just doesn't work for very many

3487
02:28:05,891 --> 02:28:10,690
iterations you have to it's it's not

3488
02:28:08,801 --> 02:28:13,091
rationally you're preparing yourself for

3489
02:28:10,690 --> 02:28:14,921
battle that's what you're doing and you

3490
02:28:13,091 --> 02:28:16,690
can't be weak when you prepare prepare

3491
02:28:14,921 --> 02:28:19,541
yourself for battle because if the

3492
02:28:16,690 --> 02:28:20,921
person says no I'm not giving you a

3493
02:28:19,541 --> 02:28:22,181
raise which is exactly what they should

3494
02:28:20,921 --> 02:28:24,400
say because what are they going to do

3495
02:28:22,181 --> 02:28:26,801
just like sprinkle the money around you

3496
02:28:24,400 --> 02:28:29,650
need to be able to say okay then there

3497
02:28:26,801 --> 02:28:31,900
will be consequences that you don't like

3498
02:28:29,650 --> 02:28:34,781
and that's what it means to say no to

3499
02:28:31,900 --> 02:28:36,821
someone no means if you continue to push

3500
02:28:34,781 --> 02:28:38,891
this things will happen that you don't

3501
02:28:36,821 --> 02:28:41,171
like now in that case it'll be all be

3502
02:28:38,891 --> 02:28:42,581
part and take my talents with me and if

3503
02:28:41,171 --> 02:28:43,751
they don't care well then you're in the

3504
02:28:42,581 --> 02:28:46,391
wrong business or you don't have any

3505
02:28:43,751 --> 02:28:49,391
talents to begin with right which is so

3506
02:28:46,391 --> 02:28:50,801
it in order to negotiate properly and

3507
02:28:49,391 --> 02:28:52,721
then this is more difficult for people

3508
02:28:50,801 --> 02:28:54,041
who are agreeable for example because

3509
02:28:52,721 --> 02:28:56,431
there tend to be more conflict averse

3510
02:28:54,041 --> 02:29:00,581
you have to put yourself in a position

3511
02:28:56,431 --> 02:29:02,531
where you can you can push back as hard

3512
02:29:00,581 --> 02:29:04,361
as you're going to be pushed on and that

3513
02:29:02,531 --> 02:29:06,190
means you have to open your you have to

3514
02:29:04,361 --> 02:29:09,121
open up your space of available options

3515
02:29:06,190 --> 02:29:12,400
because otherwise the person says no one

3516
02:29:09,121 --> 02:29:14,621
that's it you're done well you'll lose

3517
02:29:12,400 --> 02:29:18,101
that it's it's as straightforward as

3518
02:29:14,621 --> 02:29:21,341
that now with regards to the self-esteem

3519
02:29:18,101 --> 02:29:22,841
part is practice on small things because

3520
02:29:21,341 --> 02:29:24,071
you build the skills forget about the

3521
02:29:22,841 --> 02:29:25,181
self-esteem it isn't about being

3522
02:29:24,071 --> 02:29:26,681
confident or feeling

3523
02:29:25,181 --> 02:29:28,051
confidence or any of that it's about

3524
02:29:26,681 --> 02:29:31,391
knowing bloody well how to negotiate

3525
02:29:28,051 --> 02:29:32,801
start with small things you know so

3526
02:29:31,391 --> 02:29:34,301
you'll notice that there are things in

3527
02:29:32,801 --> 02:29:36,101
your relationships in particular that

3528
02:29:34,301 --> 02:29:37,990
aren't the way you want them to be and

3529
02:29:36,101 --> 02:29:39,971
that you could see how could be improved

3530
02:29:37,990 --> 02:29:41,860
it's like figure out how they can be

3531
02:29:39,971 --> 02:29:43,900
improved negotiate with your partner

3532
02:29:41,860 --> 02:29:45,221
make the incremental improvement keep

3533
02:29:43,900 --> 02:29:47,051
doing that you'll get better and better

3534
02:29:45,221 --> 02:29:48,641
at it and then you'll be able to go out

3535
02:29:47,051 --> 02:29:52,480
and have a harder negotiation in the

3536
02:29:48,641 --> 02:29:53,831
world so to set a skills there's an

3537
02:29:52,480 --> 02:29:56,190
attitude behind it you know and it's

3538
02:29:53,831 --> 02:30:00,190
easier for some people than others but

3539
02:29:56,190 --> 02:30:07,780
fundamentally it's a set of skills no

3540
02:30:00,190 --> 02:30:12,011
problem alright so now we have something

3541
02:30:07,780 --> 02:30:15,341
interesting and I expected to close this

3542
02:30:12,011 --> 02:30:17,860
off with the floor is yours dr. Peterson

3543
02:30:15,341 --> 02:30:22,450
I'd like to say thank you for making

3544
02:30:17,860 --> 02:30:24,671
your videos available online they've had

3545
02:30:22,450 --> 02:30:26,711
a great effect on me over the last year

3546
02:30:24,671 --> 02:30:29,501
I actually found them a few years ago

3547
02:30:26,711 --> 02:30:34,570
but sometime around July or August of

3548
02:30:29,501 --> 02:30:36,881
last year I got hooked I would wake up

3549
02:30:34,570 --> 02:30:39,431
at like 5:00 a.m. in the morning to

3550
02:30:36,881 --> 02:30:41,200
watch your maps of meaning releases the

3551
02:30:39,431 --> 02:30:46,150
new ones the old ones excetera

3552
02:30:41,200 --> 02:30:49,091
I found myself inspired by both the

3553
02:30:46,150 --> 02:30:51,911
academic and technical material as well

3554
02:30:49,091 --> 02:30:55,181
as what I might term the more fatherly

3555
02:30:51,911 --> 02:30:57,190
directives or wisdom I shared this with

3556
02:30:55,181 --> 02:30:59,021
my family and my friends as well as my

3557
02:30:57,190 --> 02:31:02,311
girlfriend she's here tonight as well

3558
02:30:59,021 --> 02:31:04,900
she's been following the biblical series

3559
02:31:02,311 --> 02:31:08,051
but what I'd like to say is thank you

3560
02:31:04,900 --> 02:31:11,351
for inspiring me to stand up and face

3561
02:31:08,051 --> 02:31:14,801
something that I've been afraid of all

3562
02:31:11,351 --> 02:31:16,240
my adult life and thank you for granting

3563
02:31:14,801 --> 02:31:19,831
me the permission to ask this question

3564
02:31:16,240 --> 02:31:22,949
here it's actually for my girlfriend

3565
02:31:19,831 --> 02:31:25,009
will you please stand up

3566
02:31:22,949 --> 02:31:25,009
you

3567
02:31:27,640 --> 02:31:33,439
so some might say given that we are a

3568
02:31:31,640 --> 02:31:34,790
couple of primates full of snakes it's

3569
02:31:33,439 --> 02:31:41,840
pretty miraculous that we haven't killed

3570
02:31:34,790 --> 02:31:43,640
each other but I think you're pretty

3571
02:31:41,840 --> 02:31:47,720
great and we've been talking about

3572
02:31:43,640 --> 02:31:51,220
commitment and I think I'm ready I know

3573
02:31:47,720 --> 02:31:53,859
I'm ready to commit to a life with you

3574
02:31:51,220 --> 02:31:58,779
of sorting ourselves out

3575
02:31:53,859 --> 02:31:58,779
I'd like to clean some rooms with you

3576
02:32:06,700 --> 02:32:16,229
and even as scary as the shackles of

3577
02:32:11,439 --> 02:32:16,229
marriage have been made to sing to us

3578
02:32:16,650 --> 02:32:23,500
I'm thinking about forever and simply

3579
02:32:19,750 --> 02:32:26,380
Mao in my words I love you dearly you

3580
02:32:23,500 --> 02:32:28,720
feel like home I never want to lose that

3581
02:32:26,380 --> 02:32:31,110
will you marry me if you want to come

3582
02:32:28,720 --> 02:32:31,110
here

3583
02:32:49,771 --> 02:32:57,311
so you're saying you're gonna shackle

3584
02:32:52,330 --> 02:32:58,840
yourself to me and never run away then I

3585
02:32:57,311 --> 02:33:00,870
shall suffer the rest of my life with

3586
02:32:58,840 --> 02:33:00,870
you

3587
02:33:27,300 --> 02:33:29,359
you
