1
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:13,710
I'm really looking forward to this lecture, not like I wasn't looking forward to the other ones,

2
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:19,680
but the stories that I want to cover tonight, one of the things that just absolutely staggers me about them,

3
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:25,020
especially the story of Cain and Abel (which I hope to get to) is, like, it's so short. It's unbelievable.

4
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,190
It's like ten, eleven lines.

5
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:27,300
There's nothing to it at all.

6
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:34,680
And I've found that it's essentially inexhaustible in its capacity to reveal meaning, and I don't exactly know what to make of that.

7
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,370
I mean I...

8
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,770
I think, you know, because I said I was going to take as

9
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:42,420
rational an approach to this issue as I possibly could, I think it has something to do with

10
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:47,700
this intense process of condensation across very long periods of time. That's the simplest explanation.

11
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:52,040
But I'll tell you, the information in there is so densely packed that it really is--

12
00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:58,169
it's really-- it's not that easy to come up with an explanation for that. Not one that I find fully compelling.

13
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:04,829
I mean, I do think that the really old stories (and we've been covering the really archaic stories in the Bible so far)

14
00:01:04,829 --> 00:01:09,629
I think that one of the things that you can be virtually certain about is that everything about them

15
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:12,600
that was memorable was remembered, right, and so in some sense

16
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:17,669
And this is kind of like the idea of Richard Dawkins idea of memes, which is often why I thought that Richard Dawkins

17
00:01:17,889 --> 00:01:19,889
if he was a little bit more

18
00:01:20,049 --> 00:01:26,218
mystically inclined he would have become Karl Jung, because their theories are unbelievably similar. The similar of meme and the similar of arch...

19
00:01:26,219 --> 00:01:33,239
the idea of archetypes of the collective unconscious are very, very similar ideas except Jungian ideas-- far more profound in my

20
00:01:33,909 --> 00:01:37,978
estimation well it just is he thought it [through] so much better. You know

21
00:01:38,499 --> 00:01:45,449
Because Dawkins tended to think of memes sort of like a mind worm you know something that would infest a mind and maybe multiple minds

22
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:49,649
But he never really took I don't think he really ever took the idea with the seriousness it deserved

23
00:01:49,649 --> 00:01:55,858
And I did hear him actually make a joke with Sam Harris the last time they talked about the fact that that

24
00:01:56,259 --> 00:01:58,738
there was some possibility that the

25
00:01:59,259 --> 00:02:05,189
Production of memes say religious memes could alter evolutionary history, [and] they both avoided that topic instantly

26
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:07,918
They had a big laugh about it men decided they weren't going to go down that road

27
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:11,159
and so that wasn't fair that was quite [interesting] to me, but

28
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:14,010
these

29
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:19,590
Is the the the density of these stories I do really [think] still is a is a mystery it

30
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,469
Certainly has something to do with their absolute

31
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:28,829
[their] in their impossibility to be forgotten [you] know and that's actually something that we could be tested empirically

32
00:02:28,829 --> 00:02:31,439
I don't know if anybody has ever done that because you could tell

33
00:02:31,629 --> 00:02:38,129
naive people two stories even equal length right one that had an archetypal theme and the other that didn't and then wait three months and

34
00:02:38,129 --> 00:02:41,759
See which one's people remembered better and be relatively straightforward thing to test

35
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:47,760
I haven't tested it, but maybe I will at [some] point, but anyways, that's all to say that. I'm very

36
00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:54,119
Excited about this lecture because I get an opportunity to go over the story of Adam and eve and the story of cain and Abel

37
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:59,099
And I [hopefully] [manage] both of those today, and maybe we'll get to the story of Noah and the tower of babel as well

38
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:04,169
But I wouldn't count on it not arthur eight we've been not at the rate we've been progressing if that's okay

39
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:11,399
That's that's no problem. It's there's no sense rushing this [alright]. So we're going to go before we go that before we do that

40
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,090
I want to

41
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:19,949
Finish my discussion of the idea of the psychological significance of the idea of God, and I've been thinking [about] this a lot more

42
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:26,849
You know because of course this lecture series gives me the opportunity and the necessity to continue to think and you know it

43
00:03:27,129 --> 00:03:32,789
Certainly is the [case] so the hypothesis that I've been developing with the trinitarian idea is something like

44
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:35,819
That the trinitarian idea is the earliest

45
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:41,189
Emergence in image of the idea that there has to be an underlying cognitive

46
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,259
Structure that gives rise to consciousness as well as consciousness itself and so what I would suggest

47
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:51,389
Was that the idea of God the father is something akin to the idea of the a priori?

48
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:54,029
structure that that gives rise to consciousness

49
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:59,099
You know that's an inbuilt part of us, so that's our structure. You could think about that as something

50
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:02,158
That's been produced over a vast evolutionary time span

51
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,249
and I don't think that's completely out of keeping with the with the

52
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:11,519
With the ideas [that] are laid forth in Genesis one at least if you think about them from a metaphorical perspective

53
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:16,439
And it's hard to read them literally because I don't know what you know. There's an emphasis on day and night, but

54
00:04:17,049 --> 00:04:21,149
The idea of Day and night as as 24-hour diurnal. You know

55
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:24,450
daytime and nighttime

56
00:04:25,389 --> 00:04:29,188
Interchanges [that] are based on the claw on the earthly clock seems to be a bit

57
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:34,949
Absurd when you first start to think about the construction of the cosmos so just doesn't seem to me that a literal interpretation

58
00:04:35,259 --> 00:04:35,830
is

59
00:04:35,830 --> 00:04:41,699
Appropriate and I mean it's another thing that you might not know but you know many of the early church [fathers] one of them origen

60
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:47,489
in particular stated very clearly this was in 300 ad that these ancient stories were to be taken as as

61
00:04:48,069 --> 00:04:52,739
Wise metaphors and not to be taken literally like the idea that the people who established

62
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:59,219
Christianity for example were all the sorts of people who were biblical [literalist]. It's just absolutely historically wrong

63
00:04:59,219 --> 00:05:02,489
[I] mean some of them were and some of them still are that's not the point

64
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,560
Many of them weren't and it's not like people who live 2,000 years ago were stupid by any stretch of the imagination

65
00:05:07,779 --> 00:05:15,029
And so they were perfectly capable of understanding what constant you know what constituted something approximating a metaphor and also knew that

66
00:05:15,669 --> 00:05:17,500
fiction in some sense

67
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:21,419
Considered as an abstraction could tell you truth that nonfiction wasn't able

68
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,809
Wasn't able to get at lets you think that fiction is only for entertainment

69
00:05:24,909 --> 00:05:29,339
And I think that's a very that's a that's a big mistake to think that so

70
00:05:30,069 --> 00:05:31,409
Alright, so here we go

71
00:05:31,409 --> 00:05:32,400
so yes

72
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,120
so with regards to the idea of God the father, so the idea is that

73
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:39,629
In order to make sense out of the world you have [to] have an a priori cognitive

74
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:43,409
Structure that was something that immanuel kant as I said last time

75
00:05:44,589 --> 00:05:49,169
put forward as an argument against the idea that all of the information that we

76
00:05:49,719 --> 00:05:55,049
Acquire during our lifetime [is] a consequence of incoming sense data and the reason that kant objected to that and he was

77
00:05:55,419 --> 00:06:00,299
Absolutely right about this is that you can't make sense of sense Data without an a priori structure

78
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:05,579
You can't extract from sense data the structure that enables you to make sense of sense data

79
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:08,879
It's not possible, and that's really being demonstrated

80
00:06:08,879 --> 00:06:13,739
I would say Beyond the shadow of a doubt since the 1960s and the best

81
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:16,710
demonstration of that was actually the initial failure of artificial intelligence

82
00:06:17,349 --> 00:06:24,658
because when the AI people started promising that we would have fully functional and autonomous robots and artificial intelligence back in the

83
00:06:24,939 --> 00:06:26,439
1960s

84
00:06:26,439 --> 00:06:32,039
What they didn't understand and what stole them terribly until about the early 1990s was that it was almost

85
00:06:32,229 --> 00:06:35,489
That the problem of perception with a much deeper problem than anybody ever

86
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:40,949
Recognized because like when you look at the world you just see well look there's objects out there and by the way you don't

87
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:45,350
Objects you see tools just so you know in the neurobiology. That's quite clear

88
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:47,779
You don't see objects and infer utility

89
00:06:48,090 --> 00:06:54,530
You see useful things and infer object so it's actually the reverse of what people generally think but the point is is that

90
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:59,449
Regardless of whether you see objects or useful things when you look [at] the world you just see it

91
00:06:59,449 --> 00:07:03,889
And you think well seeing is easy because they're the things are and all you have to do is like you know turn your head

92
00:07:03,889 --> 00:07:04,639
And they appear

93
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,569
And that's just so wrong that it's it's almost impossible to overstate

94
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:16,489
Like the problem of perception is staggeringly difficult and one of the primary reasons that we still don't really have autonomous robots

95
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:18,389
so there were a lot closer to it than we were in the

96
00:07:18,389 --> 00:07:24,679
1960s because it turned out that you actually have to [have] an embodied you have to have a body before you can say it and

97
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:27,829
Even more importantly you [have] to have a body before you can see

98
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:34,880
Because the act of seeing is actually the act of mapping the patterns of the world [onto] the patterns of the body. It's not

99
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:39,410
Things are out there you see them then you think about them, then you evaluate them

100
00:07:39,410 --> 00:07:44,630
Then you decide to act on them and then you act. [I] mean that you could call that a folk idea of

101
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:50,750
Psychological processing or a perception it's not that is not how it works like your eyes for [example] map

102
00:07:51,389 --> 00:07:55,038
One of the things they do is map right onto your spinal cord for example

103
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,960
They might right onto your emotional system

104
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,960
So it's actually possible for example

105
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:03,919
For people to be blind and still be able to detect facial expressions

106
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:08,448
Which is to say you can with someone who's cortically blind so they've had their visual Cortex

107
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:12,109
Destroyed often by a stroke they'll tell you that they can't see anything

108
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:17,750
But they can guess which hand you put up if you ask them to and if you flash them pictures of Angry or Fearful

109
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:21,949
Faces they show skin conductance responses to the more emotion laden faces

110
00:08:21,949 --> 00:08:28,459
And it's because imagine that the world is made out of patterns which it is then imagine that those patterns are transmitted to you

111
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:33,109
Electromagnetically you have to light and then imagine that the pattern is duplicated on the retina

112
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:39,649
And then that pattern is propagated along the optic nerve and then the pattern is distributed throughout your brain and some of that pattern

113
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:43,669
Makes up what you call conscious vision, but other parts of it

114
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:49,038
Just activate your body so for example when I look at this when I look at this this

115
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:51,650
whatever it whatever it is a

116
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,139
Bottle that's words, huh?

117
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,490
You know when I look at it

118
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:01,850
Especially with intent in mind as soon as I look at it the pattern of the bod of the bottle

119
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:04,729
activates the gripping mechanism of my hand and

120
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:09,109
Part of the action of per Sortie the active perception is to adjust

121
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:14,180
My bodily posture including my hand grip to be of the optimal size to pick that up

122
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:18,859
And it's not that I see the bottle and then think about how to move my hand

123
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:19,920
That's too slow

124
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:24,770
It's that I use my motor motor Cortex to perceive the bottle and that's actually somewhat

125
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:27,830
Independent of actually seeing the bottle as a conscious experience

126
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,000
so

127
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,739
Anyways, huh the reason the reason that I'm telling you that [all] of that

128
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,890
And there's much more about that that can be told

129
00:09:37,170 --> 00:09:42,560
Rodney Brooks ['is] someone to know about he's a robotics engineer who worked in the 1990s and he invented the Roomba

130
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,189
among many other things so he's a real genius stuffed guy and

131
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:49,099
He works was one of the first people to really

132
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,740
Point out that

133
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:53,810
to have to be [able] to have a

134
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:55,530
machine that

135
00:09:55,530 --> 00:09:57,450
Perceived well enough to work in the world

136
00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:04,549
That you had to give it a body and that the perception would actually be built from the body up rather than from the abstract

137
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:07,520
cognitive perceptions down and so

138
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:08,330
well

139
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:12,650
and that that turned out to be the case and bird rooks boiled all sorts of weird little machines in the

140
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:17,089
1990s that didn't even really have any central brain but they could do things like run away from [light] and

141
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:23,269
so they could perceive light that their perception was that act of running away from right and

142
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:29,780
So perception perception is very very very tightly tied to action in ways that people don't normally perceive

143
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:38,239
Anyways, that's all to say that you cannot perceive the [world] without being embody and you know your embodied in a manner

144
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,520
that's taken you roughly three and a half billion years to pull off right there's being a lot of death as a

145
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:51,259
Prerequisite to the embodied form that you take and so it's taken all that trial and error to produce something like you that can interact

146
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:57,049
with the complexity of the world well enough to last the relatively paltry 80 or so years that you can last and

147
00:10:57,150 --> 00:11:02,780
So I think about that as this may be wrong, but I think it's a useful at least it's a useful

148
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,320
Hypothesis, I think the idea

149
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:11,299
God the father is something like the birth of the idea that there has to be an internal

150
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:17,870
Structure that out of which consciousness itself arises that gives form to things and well

151
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:24,560
And if that's the case and perhaps it's not but if it's the case it's certainly reflection. It's a reflection of the kind of

152
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:27,020
Factual truth that I've been describing now

153
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:30,229
and then like I also mentioned that I kind of see the idea of

154
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:35,870
Both the holy Spirit and those also of christ and most specifically of christ in in the form of the word

155
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,250
as

156
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:44,210
the active consciousness that that structure produces and uses not only to to

157
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:48,169
Formulate the world because we formulate the world at least the world that we experience

158
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:54,140
We formulate but also to change and modify that world because there's absolutely no doubt that we do that

159
00:11:54,330 --> 00:11:56,479
Partly with our bodies which are optimally?

160
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:02,090
Developed to do that. Which is why we have hands unlike dolphins would have you know very large brains like us

161
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:04,399
But can't really change the world. We're really

162
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:09,380
adapted and evolved to change the world and to world and our speech [is] really a an

163
00:12:09,930 --> 00:12:17,030
Extension of our ability to use our hands, so the speech systems that we use are you know very [well-developed] motor?

164
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:21,260
very well-developed motor skill and

165
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:27,199
generally speaking your your dominant linguistic hemisphere is the same as your dominant hand and

166
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:31,700
People talk with their hands like [me] as you may have noticed [and] we use sign language

167
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:36,859
and there's a tight relationship [between] the use of the hand and the use of language, and that's partly because

168
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:38,670
language is a

169
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:44,360
productive Force and the hand is part of it part of what changes the world and so all those things are tied together in a

170
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:49,339
Very very complex way with this a priori structure and also with the embodied structure

171
00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:56,359
And I also think that's part of the reason why classical christianity puts such an emphasis not only on the divinity of the spirit

172
00:12:56,360 --> 00:12:59,210
But also on the divinity of the body, this is a harder thing to

173
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:05,479
grapple with you know it's easier [for] people to think if you think in religious terms at all that you have some sort of

174
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:11,150
Transcended spirit that somehow detached from the body that might have some life after death [something] like that

175
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:17,179
but the Christian Christianity in particular really insists on the divinity of the body, so the idea is that

176
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:24,359
There's an underlying structure. It's this quasi patriarchal nature partly because it's for complex reasons

177
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:29,130
But partly because it's a reflection of the social structure as well as other things and then that

178
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,820
uses consciousness in the form particularly of language

179
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:38,520
But most particularly in the form of truthful language in order to produce the world in a manner

180
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,799
That's good, and I think that's a walloping

181
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:48,809
Powerful Powerful idea especially the relationship between the idea that it's truthful speech that gives rise to the good because that's a really fundamental

182
00:13:48,910 --> 00:13:55,349
Moral Claim and I think that's a tough one to beat man because one of the things I've really noticed is and then this and

183
00:13:55,350 --> 00:14:01,080
It isn't just me that's for sure is that you know there's a lot of tragedy in [life]

184
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,700
There's no doubt about that and lots of people that I see for example in my clinical practice are

185
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:08,130
Laid Low by the Tragedy of life

186
00:14:08,290 --> 00:14:15,090
But I also see very very frequently that people get tangled up in deceit in webs of deceit that are often multiple

187
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:21,120
Generations long and that just takes them out you know and so that so deceit can produce

188
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:29,459
Extraordinary levels of suffering that lasts for very very long periods of time and that's really a clinical truism. You know because

189
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:31,710
freud of course identified one of the

190
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:37,530
Problems that contributed [to] the suffering we might associate with mental illness with repression

191
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:40,109
Which is it's kind of like a lie of omission

192
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:42,449
That's a perfectly reasonable way to think about it

193
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:49,950
and Jung stated straight out that there was no difference between the psychotherapeutic the curative psychotherapeutic effort and

194
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:56,520
Supreme moral effort including truth that those were the same thing as far as he was [concerned] and carl Rogers another great

195
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:59,910
Clinician who was at one point a Christian missionary before he became

196
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:07,439
More [moore's] more strictly scientific. He believed that it was in truthful, dialogue that that that

197
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:13,049
clinical transformation took place and you know it and of course one of the

198
00:15:13,300 --> 00:15:17,099
prerequisites for genuine transformation in the clinical setting is that the

199
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:22,020
Therapist tells the truth and the client tells the truth because otherwise how in the world. Do [you] know what's going on?

200
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:26,669
how can you solve the problem when you don't even know what the problem is and [you] don't know what the problem is unless the

201
00:15:26,670 --> 00:15:30,540
Person tells you the truth that's something really to think about in light [of] your own

202
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:34,080
Relationships because you know if you don't tell the people around you the truth?

203
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:36,419
And they don't know who you are and maybe that's a good thing

204
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:40,529
You know because well seriously people have reasons to Lie, right?

205
00:15:40,529 --> 00:15:41,820
I mean that aren't trivial

206
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,720
But it's really worth knowing that

207
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:49,860
you can't even get your hands on the problem unless you formulate it truthfully and if you can't get your hands on the problem the

208
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:56,219
Probability that you're going to solve it is it's just so low and so then I've been thinking [about] as well

209
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:59,819
The this and this idea has become more

210
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:08,189
Credible to [me] the longer. I've developed it the longer. I thought about it. You know the idea that there's oh

211
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:11,290
Go Bob

212
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:13,290
It's partly the idea that

213
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:21,150
Well, let me let [me] figure out how to start this property friend of mine business partner and a guy that [I've] written scientific papers

214
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,990
with very smart guy

215
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:25,529
Took me to task and I think I told you this a little bit about

216
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:29,460
Using the term dominance Hierarchy which might be fine for like

217
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:33,450
Chimpanzees and for lobsters and for creatures like that

218
00:16:33,450 --> 00:16:38,909
But not not first not not for chimpanzees even so much and and he said something [very] interesting

219
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:43,499
he thought that the [idea] of dominance Hierarchy was actually a projection of a

220
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,259
early 20th century quasi Marxist

221
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:53,219
Hypothesis [onto] the animal Kingdom that was being observed and the notion that the hierarchical structure that you see that

222
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,979
characterizes say mating hierarchies in Chimps for

223
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:01,650
Example the idea that that was predicated on power was actually a projection of a kind of political ideology

224
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:05,429
and I thought that really bugged me for a long time when he said that because

225
00:17:05,650 --> 00:17:10,469
Like because I'd really been used to using the term dominant iurc and I thought he told me all that

226
00:17:10,470 --> 00:17:12,220
I thought that's so annoying

227
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:16,860
It's so annoying because it might be right and then it took me months to think about it

228
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:22,770
And then I and then I was also reading Frans de Waal at the same time [and] he's a primatologist and also Jaak panksepp

229
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:25,030
Because he was a Brilliant Brilliant

230
00:17:25,030 --> 00:17:30,209
effective neuroscientist who unfortunately just died he wrote a great book called Affect of Neuroscience and

231
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:33,720
For rats to play they have to play fair or they won't play with each other

232
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,890
And that's that's a staggering discovery right because anything that helps

233
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:40,890
Instantiate the

234
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:45,959
Emergence of ethical behavior in animals and that associates it with an evolutionary

235
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:54,180
Process which is essentially what what pays up was doing gives credence to the [notion] that the ethics that guide us are not near

236
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:55,540
social

237
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,680
logical

238
00:17:56,680 --> 00:17:58,420
epiphenomena Constructs [their] deep

239
00:17:58,420 --> 00:18:05,100
Deeply rooted if flat and that they're rats for god's sake he can't trust them and they still play fair you [know] and De Waal

240
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:13,020
Notice that the chimp troops that he studied, but it wasn't wasn't the barber barbaric chimp that ruled with an iron fist

241
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:17,549
that was the successful ruler because he kept getting torn to shreds by his by the

242
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:23,640
Compatriots that he ignored and stomped on Susie showed some weakness. They just tear him into pieces the chimp leaders that were

243
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:27,720
Stable you know that had a stable [kingdom]. Let's say

244
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:28,960
We're very

245
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:35,220
Reciprocal in terms of their interactions with their friends and chimps have friends and they out they actually last for very long time chimp friendships

246
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:37,220
and they were also very

247
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:40,650
reciprocal in their interactions with the females and with the infants

248
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:44,219
And I thought that's [what] Frans De Waal is a very smart guy

249
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:49,470
And I thought that was also foundational science because it's really something to note that

250
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:55,590
The attributes that give rise [to] dominance in a male [dominance] Hierarchy sort of use [that] word let's call it

251
00:18:55,750 --> 00:19:01,140
Authority that might be better or even shudder competence which [I] think is a better way of thinking about it

252
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:07,619
Is that that's not predicated purely on anything? That's that's that's as simple as brute power, and I think [too]

253
00:19:07,620 --> 00:19:11,789
You know I think as well that the idea and this is [a] deeply devious and dangerous

254
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:17,940
political idea in my estimation the idea that male dominance hierarchies sorry Male hierarchies are

255
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:23,159
Fundamentally predicated on power in a little in a [law-abiding] in a law-abiding society

256
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:27,570
I think is I think all you [fu] think about that for like a month say

257
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,209
She's not long to understand

258
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:36,960
How absurd [that] is because most people who are in positions of authority let's say are just as hemmed in by ethical

259
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:41,429
responsibilities or even more so than people at the other levels of the of the hierarchy

260
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:45,959
And we know this even in the managerial literature because we know generally speaking that

261
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:50,999
Managers are more stressed by their subordinates than the subordinates are stressed by their managers

262
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:57,569
And that's not surprising you want to be responsible for like [200] people you really want that. That's hard work, man

263
00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:00,659
and I mean [I] know it's a pain to have a boss because the

264
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:06,100
To care about what the boss thinks and maybe the person is arbitrary which case they're not going to be particularly successful

265
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:09,160
But it's no joke to be responsible for 200 people

266
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,920
and you have to behave very carefully when you're in a position of

267
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:15,520
Responsibility and authority like that because you will get called out if you make mistakes

268
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:20,619
[constantly] so it's not like you're it's not like because you have a position

269
00:20:20,630 --> 00:20:26,770
That's higher up in the hierarchy that you're less constrained by ethical necessity now if you're a psychopath

270
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:28,090
Well, that's a whole different story

271
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:28,730
but

272
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:34,000
psychopaths have to move pretty rapidly from Hierarchy to hierarchy right because they get found out quite quickly and

273
00:20:34,070 --> 00:20:39,669
As soon as their reputation is shattered then they can't get away with their Shenanigans anymore, so [okay]

274
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:44,289
[so] all of this is to say that there is something very interesting about

275
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:47,499
the Pattern of Behavior [so] imagine that

276
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,369
Imagine that sexual selection is working something like this

277
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:56,170
And we know that sexual selection is a very very very very powerful biological

278
00:20:56,390 --> 00:21:03,670
Force even though biologists ignored it for almost a hundred years after charles Darwin originally wrote about it thinking mostly about natural selection

279
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:07,869
They didn't like the idea of sexual selection because it tended to introduce the notion of mind

280
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:11,169
Into the process of [evolution] because it deals with choice

281
00:21:11,510 --> 00:21:12,100
you know

282
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:15,279
But so imagine on the one hand that you have a male hierarchy

283
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:18,940
We know that the men at the top of the Hierarchy are much more likely to be?

284
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,810
Reprimanded the boil. It's particularly true of men

285
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:27,369
So you have twice as many female ancestors as you have male ancestors not going to do the math?

286
00:21:27,370 --> 00:21:31,000
But and I know it doesn't sound plausible, but you could look it up and figure it out

287
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,000
It's it's perfectly reasonable fact that actually happens to be true

288
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:40,810
So there's twice as if twice as many female ancestors because females are twice as likely on average to leave

289
00:21:41,090 --> 00:21:43,179
offspring as men now, what happens is

290
00:21:43,370 --> 00:21:48,970
Any man man who does reproduce tends to reproduce more than once but a bunch of the reproduce zero?

291
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:52,870
Whereas so it would be the average man who reproduces has two children [and]

292
00:21:53,570 --> 00:22:01,450
the average man who doesn't reproduce have zero obviously and the average woman who reproduces has one child so

293
00:22:01,970 --> 00:22:03,970
That means that there's twice as many

294
00:22:04,010 --> 00:22:10,119
Females in your line as there is males so that that's a big deal and and so imagine that it works something like this

295
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:11,990
so

296
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:13,809
the men elect

297
00:22:13,809 --> 00:22:15,289
the

298
00:22:15,289 --> 00:22:20,108
Competent men who are admired and who are and who are I?

299
00:22:20,749 --> 00:22:27,218
Can't say dominant who are who are given positions of authority and respect let's put it that way and it's like an election

300
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:34,779
Now it could be an actual democratic election, but it's at least an election of consensus or it's at least an election of well

301
00:22:34,779 --> 00:22:38,199
We're not going to kill him for now. Which is also a form of election, right?

302
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,239
it's a form of tolerance [you] know so

303
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:46,509
So and then what happens is the women for their part peel from the top of the mental Hierarchy and so you've got two

304
00:22:47,089 --> 00:22:48,529
Factors that are driving

305
00:22:48,529 --> 00:22:52,209
human sexual selection across vast stretches of evolutionary time

306
00:22:52,489 --> 00:22:56,858
One is the election of men by men to positions where they're much more [likely] to reproduce

307
00:22:56,929 --> 00:23:04,929
And the second is the tendency of women to peel off the top of [dáil] dominant turkeys which is extraordinarily well established [cross] culturally?

308
00:23:05,149 --> 00:23:07,149
even if you flatten out, the

309
00:23:07,489 --> 00:23:08,719
socio-economic

310
00:23:08,719 --> 00:23:12,909
Disparity say between men [and] women like they've [done] in scAndinavia. You don't you don't?

311
00:23:14,479 --> 00:23:18,338
Reduce the tendency of women to peel off the top [of] the male hierarchy by much

312
00:23:18,339 --> 00:23:23,079
And why would you [I] mean women are smart why in the world wouldn't they go for four?

313
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:27,729
Why wouldn't they strive to make relationships with men who [are] relatively successful?

314
00:23:27,729 --> 00:23:33,039
And why wouldn't they let the men themselves define why that how that constitutes success?

315
00:23:33,589 --> 00:23:39,339
it makes sense like if you want to figure out who the best man is why not let the men compete and the

316
00:23:39,589 --> 00:23:46,269
Man who wins whatever the competition is is the best man by definition? [how] else would you define it, so

317
00:23:46,849 --> 00:23:50,319
okay, so why am I telling you [all] that well the reason is is because

318
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:57,189
it seems to me that there's this comp this being this complex interplay across human evolution between

319
00:23:57,469 --> 00:24:01,599
the election of the male dominance Hierarchy and sexual success

320
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:08,169
And that's a big deal if it's true. It could be because what would happen [you] see is that as men evolved

321
00:24:08,719 --> 00:24:15,399
they would evolve to be better and better at climbing up the male hierarchy because the ones who weren't good at that wouldn't reproduce so

322
00:24:15,499 --> 00:24:17,119
Obviously that's going to happen

323
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:23,829
But then it wouldn't [just] be a hierarchy because there's a whole bunch of different hierarchies and so then you might say well are there

324
00:24:24,139 --> 00:24:26,139
commonalities across hierarchies

325
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:28,809
reasonable thing to propose it mean

326
00:24:28,809 --> 00:24:35,048
They're not completely opposed to one another at least if you're more success relatively more successful in [Run]

327
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:37,899
Hierarchy then you're more probable

328
00:24:37,899 --> 00:24:40,149
It's more probable that you'll be successful in another

329
00:24:40,149 --> 00:24:43,059
And that's actually a really good definition of general

330
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:49,089
Intelligence or IQ and that's actually one of the things that women select men for now men also select women for that

331
00:24:49,090 --> 00:24:55,299
But the selection pressure is even higher from women to men and general Iq is one of the things that propels you up across?

332
00:24:55,580 --> 00:25:01,779
Dominant turkeys because it's a general problem-solving mechanism, and the other thing [that] seems to do that to some degree is conscientiousness

333
00:25:01,779 --> 00:25:03,909
And there's also some evidence that women prefer

334
00:25:04,249 --> 00:25:08,649
conscientious men so and of course why wouldn't they because you can trust them and and

335
00:25:08,809 --> 00:25:11,648
And and and they work, and so those are both good things

336
00:25:11,929 --> 00:25:17,079
So then you think okay, so men have adapted to start to climb the male dominance Hierarchy

337
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:20,769
but it's the set of all possible hierarchies that they're adapted to climb and

338
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:25,119
So then you think there's there's a set of attributes that can be acted out

339
00:25:25,909 --> 00:25:31,059
That and that can be embodied that will increase the probability that you're going to rise to the top of any given

340
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:38,769
Hierarchy and then you could say well that as you adapt to that fact then you start to develop an understanding of what that pattern

341
00:25:39,169 --> 00:25:42,398
Constitutes and so that starts to become the abstract

342
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:45,999
representation of something like multi-dimensional competence

343
00:25:45,999 --> 00:25:52,089
And that's like the abstraction of virtue itself well and none of that has them none of that's arbitrary now

344
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:57,970
and that's as bloody well grounded in biology if anything could [be] and I think [that's] a really hard argument to refute and

345
00:25:58,190 --> 00:26:02,889
Like one of the things I should tell you [about] how I think is [that] when I think something

346
00:26:02,889 --> 00:26:05,139
I spend a long time trying to figure [out] if it's wrong

347
00:26:05,139 --> 00:26:07,839
You know because [I] like to hack at it from every possible Direction

348
00:26:07,909 --> 00:26:11,229
To see if it's a weak idea because if it's a weak idea

349
00:26:11,230 --> 00:26:13,749
Then I'd rather just dispense with it and find something better

350
00:26:13,749 --> 00:26:17,979
And I've had a real hard time trying to figure out what's wrong with that idea

351
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:23,860
I it seems to me that it's pretty damn solid and then the idea that

352
00:26:24,470 --> 00:26:27,999
You know if you watch what people do in movies, and so on and when they're reading fiction

353
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:33,519
It's obvious that they're very good at identifying both the hero and the antihero we could say the antihero

354
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:37,118
generally speaking the bad guy is someone who strives for

355
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,940
Authority and position, but fails

356
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,509
generally speaking not always, but fail

357
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:45,870
so he's a good bad example a kid you take a kid to a

358
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:51,480
good guy bad guy movie the kid takes out pretty fast that he's not supposed to be the bad guy and and

359
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:54,689
Figures out very quickly to zero in on the good guy

360
00:26:54,690 --> 00:27:02,070
And that means that there's there's an affinity between the pattern of good guy that's being played out in the fiction and the perceptual

361
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:07,320
Capacity of the child you [know] and one of the things I told my son when he was a kid I used to take him

362
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:10,620
to movies that were sometimes more frightening than they should have been but

363
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:16,920
One of the things I always told him was I never said don't be [afraid] because I think that's bad advice for kids

364
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:19,140
What I said was keep your eye on the hero

365
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:22,260
Right keep your [eye] on the hero and again

366
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:27,030
He was gripped by the movie and often quite afraid of them you know because movies can be very frightening

367
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:29,030
so he just like zero in on that guy and

368
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:31,919
Hoping and you know what it's like in [a] movie you hope that the good guy wins

369
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:35,219
Generally speaking, and I mean why do you do that?

370
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:40,350
Where does that where does that come from you see how deeply rooted that is inside you you'll bloody well go

371
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:43,230
Line up and pay to watch that happen

372
00:27:43,480 --> 00:27:50,669
it's not an easy thing to understand and it's it's so self-evident to people that we don't even notice that it's a tremendous mystery and

373
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:57,899
So is it so unreasonable to [think] that we would have actually over the Millennia come to some sort of collective

374
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:05,490
Conclusion about what the best of the best guys are best of the good guys are and what the worst of the bad guys are

375
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:10,199
And to me archetypically  speaking thinking of that as the Hostile brothers

376
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:16,080
So that's christ and Satan or cain and Abel for example very common mythological motif the hostile brothers

377
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,539
It's like those are those those are archetypes

378
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:25,050
it's like the satan for example is by definition the worst that a person can be and

379
00:28:25,390 --> 00:28:27,720
Christ by definition, this is

380
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,890
Independent of anything but

381
00:28:29,890 --> 00:28:34,379
Conceptualization is by definition the best today that a man can be

382
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,460
now

383
00:28:36,460 --> 00:28:39,600
as I said speaking psychologically and conceptually but I

384
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:45,930
given our capacity for imagination and our ability to engage in fiction and our love for fiction and our

385
00:28:46,420 --> 00:28:50,430
capacity to dramatize and our love for the story stories of heroism and

386
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:56,700
Catastrophe and and good and evil. [I] can't see how it [could] any other way like so [well]

387
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:58,700
so so that's part of the

388
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:04,139
Idea that's driving the notion of the evolution of the idea of God and even more specifically

389
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:10,080
Driving the evolution of the idea at least in part of the trinity so God is an abstracted ideal

390
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:12,580
formulated in large part to

391
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:19,619
Dissociate the ideal from any particular incarnation or man [or] any ruler and there's another rule in the biblical stories

392
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:26,580
which is that when the actual ruler [I've] mentioned this before when the actual Ruler becomes confused with the

393
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:33,899
Abstracted ideals then the state immediately turns into a tyranny and the whole bloody thing collapses, [so] [the] idea, it's so sophisticated

394
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:38,220
You know one of the things that we figured out and this was a hard thing to figure out was that

395
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:41,200
you had to take the

396
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:48,149
Abstraction and divorce it from any particular power structure and then think about it as something [that] existed as an abstraction

397
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:55,200
But a real thing right real and that [it] governed your behavior in [everyone's] behavior including the damned King

398
00:29:55,690 --> 00:30:02,519
The King was responsible to the abstracted ideal man that's an impossible. That is such an impossible ideal

399
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:05,009
You know why would if they agreed [that] [5000] years ago?

400
00:30:05,260 --> 00:30:11,969
But one of the things you see continually happening in the old testament [is] that as soon as the israelite for example the ISraelite Kings?

401
00:30:12,490 --> 00:30:14,200
become

402
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,400
almighty

403
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,400
the real God comes along [and] just

404
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:22,500
Cuts them into pieces and then the whole bloody state falls apart for like hundreds of years. It's like

405
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:26,160
I think that's a lesson that that we have not thoroughly

406
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:32,279
Consciously yet learned. It's still implicit in the narratives. We still haven't figured out. Why that's the case

407
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:37,380
Again, I think that's a real hard argument to to to dispense with

408
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:39,640
so

409
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,690
All right, so we looked at this a little bit

410
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:47,039
The trinitarian idea is that there's a there's a father

411
00:30:47,980 --> 00:30:49,980
that's maybe the

412
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:57,599
Dramatic representation of the structures that underlie consciousness the embody structures that underlie consciousness, and then there's the son

413
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,400
And that's that that's consciousness

414
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:04,139
But in its particular historical form that's the thing that's so interesting about the figure of the son

415
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:09,329
And then there's consciousness as such and that seems to [be] something like the the indwelling spirit and so

416
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:15,599
I mean these psychological ideas came from somewhere right that they have a history they didn't just spring out of nowhere

417
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,969
and they emerge from from dreams and

418
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:24,239
Hypothesis and artistic visions and all of that over a long time and maybe they get clarified into something like consciousness

419
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,270
but it takes a long time to get from

420
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:35,940
To get from watching you know from to chimpanzees watching each other to a human being saying well

421
00:31:35,940 --> 00:31:41,279
We're we all we all exhibit this faculty called consciousness. I mean, that's a long journey

422
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:44,519
You know that's a really long [journey], and there's going to be plenty of stages in between

423
00:31:45,070 --> 00:31:51,539
One of the things I really like about Jean piaget the developmental psychologist was that he was so insistent that

424
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:56,459
children Act out and dramatized ideas before they understand them and

425
00:31:57,280 --> 00:32:00,209
And Merlin Donald who's a psychologist at Queen's university?

426
00:32:00,370 --> 00:32:04,800
wrote a couple of interesting books along those lines at all as well looking at the importance of

427
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:08,849
imitation for the development of Higher cognition in human beings and so the notion that

428
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:14,280
We embody ideas before we abstract them out and then represent them in an articulated way

429
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:16,200
I think is an extraordinarily solid idea

430
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,420
And I really can't see how it could [be] any other way

431
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:22,769
And if you watch children you see that like think about what a child is doing

432
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:29,699
When he plays house or she plays house you know the child acts out the father or the mother

433
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:34,949
But what's so interesting about me to think well? Look isn't that cute she's imitating her mother

434
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:35,730
It's like no

435
00:32:35,730 --> 00:32:42,750
She's not that's not what happens because when your child imitates you it's very annoying because you move your arm

436
00:32:42,750 --> 00:32:47,430
And then they move their arm, and you know that you move your head to copy you no one likes that

437
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:54,719
It's direct direct imitation. That's not what a child is doing with the child is playing what the child is doing is watching the mother

438
00:32:55,330 --> 00:32:57,330
over multiple

439
00:32:58,150 --> 00:33:03,420
instantiations and then extracting out the spirit called mother and

440
00:33:03,730 --> 00:33:10,829
that's whatever if mother like across all those multiple manifestations and then laying out that pattern internally and

441
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:14,399
Manifesting itself in an abstract world, it's so sophisticated

442
00:33:14,680 --> 00:33:20,039
It's just I'm that's what you're doing when you're playing house or having a tea partier or taking care of a doll

443
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:24,420
It's not you've seen your mother take care of a doll. You haven't seen that

444
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:27,990
It's that you're smart enough to pull out the abstraction

445
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:34,109
And then embody it and certainly the child is attempting to strive towards an ideal at that point

446
00:33:34,110 --> 00:33:39,870
You know she's not lighting her doll on fire. You know well with you know certain exceptions, but generally

447
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:44,790
ones that we try to not encourage right, so

448
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:50,429
So you see that capacity in the children, and it's something we also know that if children

449
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:55,139
Don't don't engage in that sort of dramatic and pretend play to a tremendous degree

450
00:33:55,570 --> 00:34:00,330
That they don't they [don't] get properly socialized. It's really a critical element of

451
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:07,919
Developing self understanding and then also [developing] the capability [of] being with others because what you do when you're a child

452
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:13,500
Especially around the age of four is you jointly construct a shared fictional world?

453
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:17,700
Will play house together let's say and then you act out

454
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:22,830
your joint [roles] within that shared fictional world you know and and that's a form of

455
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:30,539
Very advanced cognitions very sophisticated [I] see that and piaget did as well and so did you and so did freud these brilliant?

456
00:34:30,790 --> 00:34:38,790
Observers and also Merlin Donald these brilliant observers of the manner in which cognition came to be they noted very clearly that

457
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:41,880
embodied imitation and dramatic abstraction

458
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:49,290
constituted the ground out of which higher abstract cognition emerged enough, how could it not [be] because

459
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:53,189
Obviously, we were mostly bodies before we were minds

460
00:34:53,890 --> 00:35:00,359
Clearly and so we were acting out things way before we understood them just like the chimpanzees act out the idea that

461
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:06,870
You know you have to act reasonably sensibly if your head chimpanzee or you're going to get yourself ripped apart

462
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:11,249
And you see that rules because when wolves have a dominance dispute, you know

463
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:17,939
They pump up their hair at each other to look big and they they growl and bark and you know they're very menacing and one

464
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:23,190
Wolf chickens out rolls over puts up his neck and basically what he's saying is yeah, I'm pretty useless

465
00:35:23,190 --> 00:35:28,440
So you could kill me [if] I want to if you want to and the other wolf says yeah

466
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:34,349
You know you're pretty useless and I could tear out your throat but tomorrow we might need to bring down a wolf or moves

467
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:36,540
so I'll kick you out and

468
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:40,079
And it's not like they think that

469
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:46,949
because they don't know they don't think [that] they acted out as a behavioral pattern then if you're an [anthropologist] or [a]

470
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:54,809
An ethologist and you went and watched the wolves you'd say it's as if they were acting according to the following rule and that

471
00:35:55,210 --> 00:36:02,610
Often confused me because I thought well the wolves act black wolves act out rules, and I thought no. No a rule is what we

472
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:10,439
Construct, when we articulate a behavioral pattern right we observe a stable behavioral Pattern and when we articulate it

473
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:13,080
We can call it a rule but for the wolves. It's not a rule

474
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:20,130
It's just a stable behavioral Pattern and so we acted like wolf troops or chimpanzee troops all of that

475
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:27,870
When well I'm firfer untold really [untold] tens and perhaps hundreds of millions of years before we were able to formulate

476
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,360
That pattern of behavior at anything

477
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:35,820
approximating a story or the image and [and] even longer before we could articulate it as a set of

478
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:42,899
Ethical Rules, and I'm dwelling this I know I've repeated some of this before

479
00:36:42,900 --> 00:36:49,830
But it's so important because you know there's this tremendous push, especially from the social the social

480
00:36:51,070 --> 00:36:56,399
Constructionist to make the case that ethics is arbitrary ethics is morality is relative

481
00:36:56,800 --> 00:37:00,840
There's no fundamental biological grounding in relationship to human behavior

482
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:05,460
Especially [in] the in the category of ethics, and I think that that's well first of all

483
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,460
It's dangerous because that means that people are

484
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:12,989
Anything you want to turn them into [and] you bloody well better be careful of [people] who think [that] and second?

485
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:18,330
I just think that the evidence that that's wrong is so overwhelming that we should just stop thinking that way

486
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:23,249
I mean the and that's probably why I'm also attacking this from an evolutionary perspective

487
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:28,770
there's lots of converging lines of evidence that ethic ethical standards of

488
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:34,680
at least of the most of the most crucial store Sort not only evolve but also

489
00:37:35,350 --> 00:37:41,969
Spontaneously re-emerge for example in the dramatic play of children, so we need to take that seriously and so well

490
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:43,900
That's partly what we're doing here

491
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:46,139
trying to take that seriously, so

492
00:37:53,440 --> 00:38:00,270
Okay, so the idea there at least in part was [that] the father employed the sun to generate habitable order out of Chaos [I]?

493
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:07,409
Also think there might be something more approximately true about that as well too because one of the things we do know

494
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:09,930
There's something that's cool about men

495
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:16,649
men are much more criminal than women and that by the way that does not look like it's

496
00:38:16,990 --> 00:38:22,889
Socio-cultural partly because it peaks when testosterone kicks in around 14 like it just spikes the hell up

497
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:28,380
And then it really it stays pretty high until about 27 and so standard

498
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:32,609
Penological theory for those of you who don't know this is that if you have a repeat offender?

499
00:38:32,610 --> 00:38:34,330
You know a guy who just won't stop getting in trouble

500
00:38:34,330 --> 00:38:40,469
[yes] home in prison till he's 28, and it isn't like you're rehabilitating him or anything. It's like by 28

501
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:46,889
He's done with his criminal career because the crime curve is peaks at 15 and then falls down around

502
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:48,570
27 or so it burns out

503
00:38:48,570 --> 00:38:55,620
and that's often by the way that's often that's that's often when men get married and settle down and [stabilized] one of the things that's

504
00:38:55,900 --> 00:39:01,740
One of the things that's cool about that is the creativity curve for men is almost exactly the same thing [it]

505
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:06,899
Ramps up when testosterone kicks in and then it starts to flatten out around 27 that

506
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:10,709
Curves Match very very closely so that's so that's that's quite cool

507
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:12,790
It's the creativity

508
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:20,759
Element of it that I'm particularly interested in because the creativity is in many ways it [attributed] youth and that's look. I mean

509
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:23,230
if you look at that sentence

510
00:39:23,230 --> 00:39:26,639
And you've stripped it of its religious context

511
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:32,130
what you would say is that well the older people use the younger people to

512
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:39,180
Generate creative ideas and renew [the] world it's like yeah, that's that's what happens, and you you know you also have no idea

513
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:41,110
How many of the things that we?

514
00:39:41,110 --> 00:39:45,479
Discovered or invented as human beings were stumbled across by children and adolescence

515
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:49,350
You know because they're well, they're much more exploratory

516
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:53,610
They're less constrained by their by their already extent knowledge structures

517
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:58,949
and they're less conservative so yeah that seems just right to me, so

518
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:03,570
And right in an extraordinarily important way

519
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:08,189
Because it also means that it's like if you're an actual father

520
00:40:08,890 --> 00:40:13,769
One of the things that it means is [that] that's part of what you should be encouraging your son to do right

521
00:40:13,930 --> 00:40:17,520
Which is which [is] does the rail of a father is to encourage

522
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:22,770
That is clearly the role and to encourage is to say well. Go out there confront the Chaos of

523
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:29,280
The unknown and the Chaos that underlies everything and drop it with it. You know how because you can do

524
00:40:29,280 --> 00:40:31,620
It here as big as the Chaos itself

525
00:40:31,620 --> 00:40:36,630
And you know do something useful as a consequence and makes your life [better] and make everyone else's life better

526
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:41,819
And you know you can do it and man. That's the right thing to tell that's the right thing to tell young men

527
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:45,479
You know talking to young women is more complicated because they have more more

528
00:40:46,090 --> 00:40:50,189
Let's say issues to deal with because their lives are more complicated in some ways

529
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:54,690
but that's definitely the right thing to be to be telling your your son and

530
00:40:55,210 --> 00:40:56,920
one of the things that I've really noticed

531
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:02,159
recently since I've been lecturing especially in the last seven or eight months most of my audiences being young men and and

532
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,979
I've talked a lot of them [too] a lot

533
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:08,550
I've talked a lot to them about both truth and responsibility

534
00:41:08,550 --> 00:41:12,600
and I think that those those are the two things that underlie this capacity and

535
00:41:13,210 --> 00:41:18,990
It there seems to me to be a tremendous [hunger] for that idea. It's not the same idea as right

536
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:24,090
You know it's very different ideas. It's a counterpart to right and so it's you know

537
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:28,140
Life is [hard]. [it's] chaotic. It's difficult. It's really

538
00:41:28,690 --> 00:41:29,910
Definitely a challenge

539
00:41:29,910 --> 00:41:34,680
And so you can either shrink from that and no bloody wonder because you know it's going to kill you

540
00:41:34,780 --> 00:41:38,040
It's not it's no joke man where you can?

541
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:41,070
Fuckin front it and try to do something about it

542
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:44,579
Well, what's better and and then you say [to] the person look man?

543
00:41:44,580 --> 00:41:49,799
you could do it like that's what a human being is like and if you just stood up and got yourself together and

544
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:53,880
You find out by trying that you can in fact do that

545
00:41:53,880 --> 00:42:00,209
And I do think that that's that's a great core religious message as far as I [can] tell and I think that's deeply embedded

546
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:03,600
in this sort of in this sort of idea, so

547
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:09,989
All right, so this is what I've [been] telling you. This is something like how knowledge itself is generated

548
00:42:11,830 --> 00:42:13,830
first of all there's the unknown as

549
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:19,949
And that's really what you don't know anything about and generally when you encounter that you don't encounter it with thought

550
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:22,590
You encounter it like this

551
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:24,780
Right and that that's the first

552
00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:31,919
Representation of the absolutely unknown, it's something that is beyond your comprehension, and it's terrifying and because it's Beyond your comprehension

553
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:34,500
You cannot perceive it you cannot understand it

554
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,959
But you still have to deal with it and the way you deal with it

555
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:43,139
Is [that] you freeze that's what the that's what a basilisk does say to the to the kids in Harry Potter, right?

556
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:43,890
They take a look at it

557
00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:44,650
And they freeze

558
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:46,090
that's the snake the

559
00:42:46,090 --> 00:42:52,109
Terrible snake of Chaos that lives underneath everything you see that that thing freezes you and that's because [you're] a prey animal

560
00:42:52,109 --> 00:42:56,759
but at the same time it makes you curious, and so that's the first level of

561
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,570
contact with the absolute unknown is the

562
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:05,339
Emotional combination of freezing and curiosity and that's reflected

563
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:08,879
I think in the dragon stories the dragon is the terrible thing that lives underground

564
00:43:09,310 --> 00:43:14,099
Accords gold or hoards Virgins very very strange behavior for reptile as we pointed out before

565
00:43:14,530 --> 00:43:19,320
but the idea [is] that it's a symbolic representation of the

566
00:43:19,810 --> 00:43:23,339
Predatory quality of the Unknown combined with the

567
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:27,450
capacity of the Unknown to generate nothing but novel information

568
00:43:27,490 --> 00:43:34,379
And it's very you can see that is very [characteristic] of human beings because we are prey animals, but we're also unbelievably

569
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,990
Exploratory and we're pretty damn good predators

570
00:43:36,990 --> 00:43:41,909
And we occupy this weird cognitive niche and so one of the things we've learned is that if we?

571
00:43:42,220 --> 00:43:47,699
Forth Lightly confront the unknown terrifying as it is there's a massive prize to be gained

572
00:43:48,190 --> 00:43:50,339
continually and so that seems to be

573
00:43:51,550 --> 00:43:52,869
true, right

574
00:43:52,869 --> 00:44:00,269
[it's] true as anything is and then I would also say that that idea and we know that one of the metaphors that underlies [gods]

575
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:02,290
extraction of

576
00:44:02,290 --> 00:44:08,939
Habitable order out of Chaos at the beginning of time is an older idea and a more archaic idea that God

577
00:44:09,339 --> 00:44:11,200
confronted something like the

578
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:17,220
leviathan and that's one of the words for this serpent like Chaos creature that's often used in the old testament or the

579
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:20,550
Leviathan and they

580
00:44:20,740 --> 00:44:24,810
Beat them on. Yeah. That's the other thing and so there's this [idea] that

581
00:44:24,810 --> 00:44:29,660
I think came probably came from the mesopotamia that the God either in the [sun-like]

582
00:44:29,910 --> 00:44:34,550
Aspect or in the father like aspect is the thing that confronts this terrible beast that?

583
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:36,420
represents the Chaotic unknown and

584
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:43,129
Cuts it into pieces and then sometimes gives the body parts to the populace in order to feed them so you can see a hunting

585
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:46,069
Metaphor there as well, but it's deeper than that and so

586
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:48,240
all right, so

587
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:54,409
The first thing is there's the absolute unknown and the unknown is what you do not understand. It's what's beyond the campfire

588
00:44:54,410 --> 00:44:59,930
Maybe it's what's beyond the tree even more anciently [an] old [word] when we when we lived in trees

589
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:02,629
It's out there that where you don't know and what's out there

590
00:45:03,150 --> 00:45:07,460
Crocodiles and snakes and birds of prey and cats and all sorts of things like predatory cats

591
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:11,569
And they will eat you but there's utility and going out there to find out

592
00:45:11,570 --> 00:45:13,310
What's there like maybe you go?

593
00:45:13,310 --> 00:45:19,789
And you don't kill the snake you kill the damn nest of snakes and that makes you pretty popular just as you should be that

594
00:45:20,250 --> 00:45:22,639
accelerates your your rep reductive

595
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:27,440
Potential let's say and we're descended from people who did that and so we have this?

596
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:34,909
Notion about how the world is structured that's deeply embedded in our pSyChe [like] really really deeply way way down way below

597
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:36,390
the surface

598
00:45:36,390 --> 00:45:40,879
Cognition way down in the limbic system in these ancient parts of the brain that are like

599
00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:44,239
60 million years old or a hundred million years old or older than that?

600
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:46,130
ancient ancient brain structures

601
00:45:46,130 --> 00:45:48,829
And so the first thing we do is we act out our

602
00:45:49,140 --> 00:45:55,069
Encounter with the unknown world and we act that out in the same way in a manner. That's analogous to the Manner

603
00:45:55,070 --> 00:46:01,340
That's presented as a description of what it is that God does at the beginning of time to extract habitable order out of Chaos?

604
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:08,029
And [I] I will tell you about the other part of that for now, so you act it out first and then

605
00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:12,230
The second thing is you watch people who act it out?

606
00:46:12,230 --> 00:46:15,770
And you start to make representations of that that's stories, right?

607
00:46:15,800 --> 00:46:19,969
And maybe you admire them and then after a long time you collect a bunch of those stories

608
00:46:19,970 --> 00:46:23,599
and then you can say what that is you can articulate it as a pattern and

609
00:46:23,790 --> 00:46:28,909
So and this is something Nietzsche also figured out to begin with you know because prior [to] Nietzsche

610
00:46:28,910 --> 00:46:34,010
[I] would say he did so many things first it was quite remarkable. You know there was an idea that

611
00:46:34,830 --> 00:46:39,620
You first think and then you act, and then people like to think that of course you do it

612
00:46:40,290 --> 00:46:46,860
Bloody Rubbish because you're impulsive as you can possibly imagine you're always doing things before you think and sometimes

613
00:46:46,860 --> 00:46:51,059
That's a really good idea so the idea that you see things and then think and then act

614
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:56,249
It's like you really know I'm sorry did I don't do that. I know one

615
00:46:56,250 --> 00:46:58,919
I know I know does that and they certainly do that

616
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:05,160
Don't do that when they're emotional you know you act first and one of the things that Nietzsche said very clearly was that our

617
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:11,760
Ideas emerged out of the ground of our action over over thousands and thousands of years and then when philosophers were

618
00:47:11,950 --> 00:47:17,010
Putting forward those ideas what they were doing wasn't generating creative ideas

619
00:47:17,010 --> 00:47:20,219
They were just telling the story of humanity

620
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:27,899
It's already there. It's already in us it's already in our patterns of behavior and and it strikes me that that's

621
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:33,060
Well he was a genius and that was one of the genius one of his

622
00:47:33,880 --> 00:47:39,509
Many many observations of pure genius and so you can think about it. You know you can think about it like this, [too] is that?

623
00:47:40,600 --> 00:47:45,600
There's unknown and then you act in the face [of] the unknown and then you you dream about the action

624
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:50,040
and that's what you're doing in a movie theater, and then you speak about it and

625
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:55,230
So you know and of course once you speak about it that affects how you dream and how you dream affects

626
00:47:55,230 --> 00:48:02,010
How you act it's not like the all of the causal direction is it was one way because it's not deep these things loop

627
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:07,770
But it's still from the unknown through the body through the imagination into articulation

628
00:48:07,770 --> 00:48:14,280
That's the primary mode of the generation of of wisdom let's say and you can easily map that onto an evolutionary explanation

629
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:20,729
Because the body comes first right and then is the imagination, which is the body in

630
00:48:21,130 --> 00:48:27,329
Abstraction and only then the word and of course that's [exactly] how things did evolve because we could imagine things

631
00:48:27,670 --> 00:48:31,290
Long before we could speak at least that's the theory, so

632
00:48:32,260 --> 00:48:35,070
and I represented that this is a

633
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:39,210
image from my book maps of meaning and so

634
00:48:39,640 --> 00:48:45,509
So the idea is that this is the fundamental representation of the unknown as such it's half

635
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:52,350
spirit because it partakes of the air like a bird and it's half matter because it's on the ground like a like a like a

636
00:48:52,610 --> 00:48:57,620
Make and and that's what you think is there when you don't know what is there?

637
00:48:57,620 --> 00:49:03,799
That's how your body reacts to what's there when you don't know what is there? You know that [too] because if you're alone at night

638
00:49:04,590 --> 00:49:09,739
You know it maybe you're a little rattled up for one reason other maybe you watched a horror movie and you know there's some weird

639
00:49:09,740 --> 00:49:13,580
Noise in the other room. It's dark, and you could just try this once

640
00:49:13,580 --> 00:49:15,830
It's like so you're on edge you think

641
00:49:16,290 --> 00:49:19,340
You want to turn the light on and go in the room and see don't do that

642
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:23,059
just open the door a little bit and sneak your hand in and just watch what your

643
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:23,970
imagination

644
00:49:23,970 --> 00:49:30,230
Fills that room with right and then then you remember what it's like to be three years old in bed in afraid of the dark

645
00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:33,109
Right and I read a good book on dragons lately

646
00:49:33,810 --> 00:49:40,430
Recently that that that had a very interesting hypothesis about them. I thought one of the things the guy did was track

647
00:49:40,430 --> 00:49:42,430
I can't remember his name unfortunately

648
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:47,689
Track how common the image of the dragon was worldwide. It's unbelievably widespread

649
00:49:47,690 --> 00:49:52,309
it's crazily widespread and he thought that this was actually the category of

650
00:49:53,580 --> 00:49:55,580
Primate Predator and

651
00:49:56,220 --> 00:50:01,939
The Predator was so predator is a weird category right because like there's there's crocodiles in it, and there's lions

652
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:05,899
And they don't have much in [common] except they eat you so it's a functional category

653
00:50:05,900 --> 00:50:12,289
And so this is the this is the imagistic representation of the functional category of Predator and his predator

654
00:50:12,290 --> 00:50:17,509
Theory was well if you're a monkey, then a bird would pick you off like an eagle, and so that's this

655
00:50:18,930 --> 00:50:20,370
right and

656
00:50:20,370 --> 00:50:26,420
Then if it wasn't eagle it was a cat as they climb teary trees and give you a good chomping and then if it wasn't

657
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:31,309
a cat
And you go down to the ground and a snake would get you or maybe a snake would climb up the tree because snakes like?

658
00:50:31,310 --> 00:50:33,310
to do that and get you and so that's a

659
00:50:34,410 --> 00:50:35,910
pre cat

660
00:50:35,910 --> 00:50:37,140
snake

661
00:50:37,140 --> 00:50:38,220
basically

662
00:50:38,220 --> 00:50:40,729
Free cat snake bird, and that's the thing you really

663
00:50:41,340 --> 00:50:44,840
That's the thing [you're] really want to avoid you don't want to come across one of those and so

664
00:50:45,240 --> 00:50:47,600
[and] then you know the other thing it does is breathe fire

665
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:53,150
Which is quite [interested] [because] obviously fire was both greatest friend and greatest enemy of humanity

666
00:50:53,190 --> 00:50:57,289
And we've mastered fire for a long time it might be as long as [two] or [three] million years

667
00:50:58,050 --> 00:51:04,820
That's what Richard rang him. [I] think it's [rang] [ham]. He wrote a book recently on. I think it was ragan

668
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:11,260
who wrote a book on when human beings [learned] to cook that was about two million years ago and cooking increased the

669
00:51:12,410 --> 00:51:16,990
Increase the availability of calories you know how chimpanzees are sort of shaped like a big

670
00:51:17,510 --> 00:51:19,810
Like they're ugly. They're shaped like a big bowling ball

671
00:51:19,810 --> 00:51:23,079
You know they're really they look really fat, [and] it's and they're short

672
00:51:23,079 --> 00:51:29,199
and they're wide and that's because they have intestinal tracts that are like you know 300 miles long and the reason for that is because

673
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:34,629
they have to digest leaves and so you go out in the forest and like sit there and eat leaves for a whole day and

674
00:51:34,630 --> 00:51:40,630
See how that works out for you. You know yeah, they have no calories in them. So chimps spend about [inkless] I

675
00:51:41,630 --> 00:51:44,020
think it's eight hours a day chewing and

676
00:51:44,930 --> 00:51:47,290
It's because what they eat has no nutritional value

677
00:51:47,290 --> 00:51:48,800
And then they have to have this tremendous

678
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:52,989
Guts in order to extract anything at all out of it human beings at some point

679
00:51:52,990 --> 00:51:56,679
Just thought oh to hell [with] that we'll cook something and then we traded our guts for brain

680
00:51:56,930 --> 00:52:00,940
Which you know more or less has worked, and I think it's made us a lot more attractive as well

681
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:04,720
So okay well, so the idea here was that

682
00:52:05,450 --> 00:52:12,399
Well, that's the basic archetype [of] the unknown as such and then I like the st.. George version of this it's so cool because

683
00:52:13,130 --> 00:52:18,550
St.. George lives in a like a castle and the castle is partly falling down and it's partly because there's a dragon

684
00:52:18,550 --> 00:52:20,709
That's come up [to] like it's an eternal dragon

685
00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:23,649
It's come back to giver who in a rough time which always happens

686
00:52:23,869 --> 00:52:30,279
Because there isn't the eternal dragon is always given are giving our fallen down castles a rough time always

687
00:52:30,670 --> 00:52:32,050
And so then St.

688
00:52:32,050 --> 00:52:34,929
[George's] the Hero who goes out to confront the dragon and he

689
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:39,010
Frees the virgin from its grasp and I would say that's a pretty straightforward

690
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:45,250
Story about the sexual attractiveness of the masculine spirit that's willing to forthrightly encounter the unknown

691
00:52:45,619 --> 00:52:52,659
That's it looks just straight looks like a straight biological representation to [me], and it's a really really old story

692
00:52:52,910 --> 00:52:57,550
Right it's the oldest written story. We have and that's basically the mesopotamian creation myth

693
00:52:57,550 --> 00:53:04,389
The anu male ish, which which basically lays out precisely that story and so and it's replayed. I mean I bet you

694
00:53:05,420 --> 00:53:11,050
The movie Goers Among you especially the ones that [are] more attracted [to] the superhero. You know they're really flashy sort of

695
00:53:11,270 --> 00:53:13,659
Superhero type movies, you've probably seen the St.

696
00:53:13,660 --> 00:53:20,410
George story like 150 times in the last 10 [years] you never get tired of it because it's the central story of mankind so

697
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:22,930
you've got the unknown as such and

698
00:53:23,660 --> 00:53:29,289
That is what you react to with your body in the existential terror and extraordinary

699
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:34,870
Curiosity are gripping you and then it's like the unknown unknowns that

700
00:53:35,930 --> 00:53:37,930
Who's the politician under bush?

701
00:53:39,140 --> 00:53:43,509
Rumsfeld yeah, I think the reason that that phrase caught on so well is because he nailed an archetype

702
00:53:43,690 --> 00:53:46,269
There's unknown unknowns, and there's known unknowns

703
00:53:46,270 --> 00:53:52,450
and that's the unknown unknown and you have to be able to react [to] an unknown unknown because they can get you and

704
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:59,170
You can't just plead ignorance because then you're dead that doesn't work like human beings are the sort of creature who has to know what?

705
00:53:59,170 --> 00:54:04,239
To do when they don't know what to do, and that's very paradoxical and what we do is we prepare to do everything

706
00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:05,290
That's right

707
00:54:05,290 --> 00:54:10,090
We're on guard we prepare to do everything very very stressful and but also very engaging and very

708
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:12,670
Very much something that heightens consciousness

709
00:54:12,670 --> 00:54:14,390
and maybe those circuits are

710
00:54:14,390 --> 00:54:20,379
Permanently turned on in human beings because we also know that we're going to die and no other animal knows that and so sometimes I

711
00:54:20,380 --> 00:54:26,289
[think] that our that our stress circuits are just on all the time, and that's part of what accounts for our heightened consciousness

712
00:54:26,750 --> 00:54:29,830
so you have your unknown unknowns and then you have your

713
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:36,549
relatively you have the unknowns that you actually encounter in the world like the mystery of your of your

714
00:54:37,910 --> 00:54:39,880
Romantic partner when you have a fight [with] them

715
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:40,450
It's like [well]

716
00:54:40,450 --> 00:54:45,669
We're having a fight who the hell are you [I] mean you're not the absolute unknown because I know something about you

717
00:54:45,670 --> 00:54:51,519
but you're the unknown as its manifesting itself to me right now, right and and and then there's a

718
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:53,680
known that we inhabit

719
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:59,529
And then there's the knower and the known is given symbolic representation as far as I've been able to tell in

720
00:54:59,990 --> 00:55:05,170
Patriarchal form in the form of male deities and the unknown as you encountered

721
00:55:05,170 --> 00:55:07,170
it's given Feminine form so

722
00:55:07,370 --> 00:55:12,160
We won't get into that too much but but if you're interested in that you could look at my maps of meetings lectures

723
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:19,059
Or maybe take a look at the book but I think it's a good. I think it's a good schema for religious archetypes

724
00:55:19,060 --> 00:55:25,420
I've worked on a long time it seems to fit the union Criteria quite nicely. It maps nicely [onto] Joseph Campbell's ideas

725
00:55:25,420 --> 00:55:27,969
He got almost all has ideas from you however

726
00:55:28,700 --> 00:55:30,080
and

727
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:36,519
It also makes sense from a biological and an evolution a perspective as far as I [can] tell that's a lot of cross validation

728
00:55:36,680 --> 00:55:38,680
at least in my estimation

729
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:43,689
So okay so back to the hierarchy of dominance. Well, let's take a look at it a little bit, so

730
00:55:44,210 --> 00:55:47,020
I'm quite enamored of lobsters as some of you might know

731
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:52,240
Because I found out this just blew me away when I found it out. I mean

732
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:54,790
I I've done a lot of work in Neuro Chemistry

733
00:55:55,430 --> 00:56:00,100
Some similar chemistry because I used to study alcoholism and drug abuse and alcoholism

734
00:56:00,620 --> 00:56:01,780
to study alcohol

735
00:56:01,780 --> 00:56:03,850
You have to know a lot about the brain because alcohol goes

736
00:56:03,950 --> 00:56:06,790
Everywhere in the brain it affects every neural chemical system

737
00:56:06,790 --> 00:56:10,870
And so if you're going to study alcohol it kind of has to study, Neuro chemistry in General

738
00:56:11,060 --> 00:56:14,620
And so I did that [for] [quite] a long time. I really got in a [murud] of a book

739
00:56:15,140 --> 00:56:20,140
Called the Neuro psychology of anxiety by [Jeffery] Gray which is an absolute work of genius although extraordinarily?

740
00:56:20,690 --> 00:56:23,560
Did I don't know how many references that book has it's like?

741
00:56:24,410 --> 00:56:28,540
Must be a thousand and gray actually read them and worse

742
00:56:28,540 --> 00:56:31,269
he understood them and then and then he and then he

743
00:56:31,340 --> 00:56:38,229
integrated them [into] this book and so to read it you have to really master functional neural chemistry and animal Behaviorism and and

744
00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:42,310
Motivation and emotion and neural anatomy like it's a killer book

745
00:56:42,310 --> 00:56:42,730
but man

746
00:56:42,730 --> 00:56:47,469
It's really rich and it's taken psychologists about 40 years to really unpack that book

747
00:56:47,780 --> 00:56:51,340
But one of the things I learned about that was just exactly how much

748
00:56:51,530 --> 00:56:57,040
Continuity there was in the neural chemistry of human beings in the neural chemistry of animals. It's absolutely staggering

749
00:56:57,290 --> 00:57:02,229
It's the sort of thing that makes the fact of evolution something like [self] [evident]

750
00:57:02,230 --> 00:57:09,010
I do think it's self-evident for other reasons that I'll tell you about later. I think evolution or I think natural selection

751
00:57:09,590 --> 00:57:16,179
Random mutation and natural selection is the only way you can solve the problem of how to deal with an environment

752
00:57:16,180 --> 00:57:18,790
That's complex Beyond your ability to comprehend

753
00:57:18,790 --> 00:57:23,620
[I] think what you do is you generate endless variants because [God] only knows what the [hell's] going to happen next

754
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:27,730
They all almost all [of] them die because they're failures and a couple

755
00:57:27,890 --> 00:57:34,209
propagate and you know the environment keeps moving around like a giant snake you never know what it's going to do next and so the

756
00:57:34,210 --> 00:57:35,390
Best you can do is say well

757
00:57:35,390 --> 00:57:41,229
Here's thirty things that might work, and you know twenty-eight of them are going to perish if you're if you're an insect

758
00:57:41,230 --> 00:57:43,750
It's like the ratio is way way higher than that, so

759
00:57:44,450 --> 00:57:46,450
Anyways back to the lobsters

760
00:57:46,710 --> 00:57:50,000
In all of these so these creatures engage in in

761
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:55,910
Dominance disputes and and I think dominance is the right way to think about it because lobsters aren't very empathic

762
00:57:55,910 --> 00:57:59,479
And they're not very social and so it really is the toughest lobster that wins

763
00:57:59,640 --> 00:58:02,450
You know and what's so cool [about] the lobster is that?

764
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:08,749
When a lobster wins he flexes and gets bigger, so he looks bigger because [he's] a winner

765
00:58:08,750 --> 00:58:14,930
It's like he's advertising that and the biological the [neurochemical] system that makes him flex is serotonergic

766
00:58:14,930 --> 00:58:17,509
And you think well who cares what the hell does [that] mean?

767
00:58:17,510 --> 00:58:18,650
Well tell you what it [means]

768
00:58:18,650 --> 00:58:20,650
It's the same chemical that's affected by

769
00:58:20,820 --> 00:58:27,110
Antidepressants in human beings and so like if you're depressed you're a defeated lobster like you're like this. I'm small

770
00:58:27,110 --> 00:58:31,339
I'm not you know things are dangerous. I don't want to fight you give someone an antidepressant

771
00:58:31,350 --> 00:58:35,690
It's like up they stretch, and then they're ready to like take on the world again

772
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:41,779
Well if you give lobsters who just got defeated in the fight serotonin, then they stretch out and they'll fight again

773
00:58:41,780 --> 00:58:46,759
and that's like we separated from those creatures on the evolutionary timescale somewhere between

774
00:58:47,010 --> 00:58:54,200
350 and 600 million years ago, and the damn Neuro chemistry is the same and so that's another indication of just how

775
00:58:54,720 --> 00:58:59,930
important Hierarchies of Authority are I mean they've been conserved since the time of

776
00:59:00,180 --> 00:59:06,229
Lobsters right there weren't trees around when lobsters first first manifested themselves on the planet

777
00:59:06,230 --> 00:59:11,900
and so what that means is these hierarchies that I've been talking about those things are older than trees and

778
00:59:12,390 --> 00:59:18,379
So one of the truisms for what constitutes real from a Darwinian perspective?

779
00:59:18,750 --> 00:59:26,300
Is that which has been around the longest period of time right because it's had the longest period of time to exert selection pressure

780
00:59:26,610 --> 00:59:31,969
Well, we know we evolved and lived in trees something on the order of 60 million years ago

781
00:59:31,970 --> 00:59:35,570
we're talking [ten] times as far back as that for the

782
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:40,820
Hierarchy and so the idea that human beings that the hierarchy [is] something that has exerted

783
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:47,029
Selection pressure on human beings is I don't think that's a disputable. That's not a disputable issue

784
00:59:47,490 --> 00:59:51,979
How it's done it and exactly what that means we can argue about but like that sort of biological

785
00:59:52,530 --> 00:59:55,249
Continuity is just absolutely unbelievable [I]

786
00:59:55,950 --> 00:59:58,789
It was funny because I revealed this finding

787
00:59:59,460 --> 01:00:01,260
I didn't discover this I read about it

788
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:05,429
But [I] talked to my graduate students about I used to take them out for breakfast you know and they were very

789
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:07,920
contentious Snappy Bunch and

790
01:00:07,990 --> 01:00:10,229
And they're always trying to one-up each other

791
01:00:10,230 --> 01:00:13,649
And they're quite witty and for like six months until it got very annoying

792
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:17,910
Every time one of them went up the other they'd stretch themselves out like snap their hands like

793
01:00:19,270 --> 01:00:26,580
So [that] was that was very funny. It was really very funny. So you see this in Lobsters, and so that's pretty amazing so

794
01:00:27,310 --> 01:00:30,330
You know and one of the other thing that's really cool about lobsters

795
01:00:30,330 --> 01:00:35,849
Is that let's say you've been like talk lobster for a long time, but you're getting kind of old and some young

796
01:00:36,460 --> 01:00:42,689
Lobster just you know whales the hell out of you and and so you're all depressed, but thing is your brain is dominant

797
01:00:43,210 --> 01:00:45,570
But you don't have much of a brain because you're a lobster

798
01:00:45,570 --> 01:00:50,519
and so now what are you going to do because you just lost and the answer is while your brain will dissolve and

799
01:00:50,890 --> 01:00:52,890
Then you'll grow a subordinate brain

800
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:59,760
Yeah, so that's we're thinking about [two] right here for a couple of reasons first of all if any of you have ever been seriously

801
01:01:00,130 --> 01:01:04,109
Defeated in life. You know what that's like. It's like

802
01:01:04,110 --> 01:01:06,660
It's a death a descent a dissolution

803
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:09,000
and if you're lucky a regrowth

804
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:15,929
And and maybe not as the same person that's what happens to people with post-traumatic [stress] disorder right their brains undergo permanent neurological

805
01:01:16,270 --> 01:01:17,230
Transformation and

806
01:01:17,230 --> 01:01:18,130
they then

807
01:01:18,130 --> 01:01:23,790
Inhabit a world it's much more dangerous than the world that they inhabited to begin with but we also know - if you have post-traumatic

808
01:01:23,790 --> 01:01:27,149
Stress disorder or depression that your hippocampus shrinks

809
01:01:27,430 --> 01:01:34,680
Right it dies and shrinks and you can sometimes get it to grow back your hippocampus shrinks and your amygdala grows and the amygdala

810
01:01:34,930 --> 01:01:42,540
increases emotional sensitivity and the hippocampus inhibits emotional sensitivity and so if you've been badly defeated the hippocampus shrinks and the amygdala Grows

811
01:01:42,700 --> 01:01:44,700
now if you recover the

812
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:51,089
hippocampus will regrow and the antidepressants actually seem to help that but the damn amygdala never shrinks again and

813
01:01:51,610 --> 01:01:55,079
So well so that's another lesson from the lobster

814
01:01:55,080 --> 01:02:00,360
It's quite a terrifying one but but it's one like it's so interesting that [you] can relate to that, [right]?

815
01:02:00,360 --> 01:02:03,360
It's like I get what that poor crustacean is going through you know

816
01:02:05,200 --> 01:02:07,200
so

817
01:02:07,450 --> 01:02:12,629
Okay, here's the rats and this is from yak [bank] [steps] work rat. He was the first guy who figured out the rats giggle

818
01:02:14,380 --> 01:02:20,490
And you might think well, what kind of stupid thing is that to study is like [$50,000] research grant for giggling rats. You know [aside]?

819
01:02:21,369 --> 01:02:22,599
but

820
01:02:22,599 --> 01:02:28,469
He discovered the play circuitry in mammals. That's a big deal right? It's like discovering a whole new continent

821
01:02:28,470 --> 01:02:32,360
There's a play circuit in mammals

822
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:34,679
. It's built right in so it's not socially constructed. There's a there's a biological

823
01:02:35,230 --> 01:02:37,230
Platform for that and so what?

824
01:02:37,660 --> 01:02:43,410
[panksepp] would do with rats he found out if rats if you take a rat puff away from its mother it dies

825
01:02:43,690 --> 01:02:46,740
Even if you feed it even if you keep it warm it dies now

826
01:02:46,740 --> 01:02:50,520
you can stop it from dying by taking a pencil with an eraser on the end and

827
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:56,879
Massaging it right because rats won't live without love and the same thing happens to human babies

828
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,880
And we saw that Romania when there was that

829
01:02:59,020 --> 01:03:03,989
Catastrophe have to tell Chesco in the orphanages where the orphanages were full of unwanted babies because

830
01:03:04,119 --> 01:03:07,259
Ceausescu insisted that every Romanian woman was constantly pregnant

831
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:13,199
So the orphan is just stacked up with unwanted babies lots of them didn't even have names and they were warehoused warm

832
01:03:14,079 --> 01:03:16,079
shelter food

833
01:03:16,599 --> 01:03:22,379
Devastating lots of them died most of them died before the first year and the ones that didn't die were permanently

834
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:24,970
dysfunctional because

835
01:03:24,970 --> 01:03:30,750
You have to be touched if you're a human being it's not an option you have to be played with it's not an option

836
01:03:31,180 --> 01:03:33,599
It's it's part of Neural Developmental Necessity

837
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:38,909
And you have to also play fair, so because otherwise you produce a very disjointed

838
01:03:39,280 --> 01:03:42,809
Child who isn't able to engage in the niceties of social interaction?

839
01:03:42,809 --> 01:03:49,769
Which is continual play in some sense and reciprocity so what panksepp did with his [rat] he noticed that male rats?

840
01:03:50,200 --> 01:03:53,490
juveniles really liked to wrestle and they wrestle just like

841
01:03:53,740 --> 01:03:54,309
humans

842
01:03:54,309 --> 01:03:58,469
Beings wrestle they pinned each other for crying out loud with like that that rat has just lost

843
01:03:58,470 --> 01:04:03,179
He's down for a ten count right and so so what you do is you take Juvenile rats?

844
01:04:03,180 --> 01:04:05,180
And you can find out that they want to play

845
01:04:05,530 --> 01:04:07,030
because

846
01:04:07,030 --> 01:04:09,030
you can attach a spring to them and

847
01:04:09,549 --> 01:04:14,789
Then they'll try to run and you can measure how hard they're running by how hard they're pulling on the spring and then you can

848
01:04:14,790 --> 01:04:17,519
Estimate how motivated they [are] and so you can find out that?

849
01:04:18,060 --> 01:04:23,370
well Fed rat who doesn't have anything on his mind will still work hard to play if

850
01:04:24,130 --> 01:04:28,410
To enter an arena where he's been allowed to play before he'll work [for] that

851
01:04:28,410 --> 01:04:31,379
So that you think while the rats motivated, so the two rats

852
01:04:31,380 --> 01:04:31,950
Go out there

853
01:04:31,950 --> 01:04:32,890
and they play and

854
01:04:32,890 --> 01:04:39,569
And so they're playing like dogs play and everyone knows what that looks like if you're you know what you have any sense about dogs

855
01:04:39,640 --> 01:04:42,569
[they] kind of go like this and kids do that and

856
01:04:42,640 --> 01:04:48,779
maybe you do that with your [wife] if you're gonna play with her a little bit okay my poor my poor wife man when she

857
01:04:49,750 --> 01:04:51,340
Huh?

858
01:04:51,340 --> 01:04:53,340
she was a she was a

859
01:04:53,770 --> 01:04:59,189
Young she had older siblings and so she wasn't played with as much when she was little as she might have been and I

860
01:04:59,740 --> 01:05:02,310
Used to like you know what you take a pill away

861
01:05:02,310 --> 01:05:06,120
And you go like this three times right that means look out a pillow is coming your way

862
01:05:06,340 --> 01:05:08,969
So I go one two [three] wow

863
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:14,819
But she looked she was completely dismayed at me like what do you do that for and I thought well I?

864
01:05:16,300 --> 01:05:19,769
Eventually taught her that rule the other thing I used to do

865
01:05:23,740 --> 01:05:26,820
The only thing I used to do you know it said sometimes

866
01:05:26,820 --> 01:05:30,299
She'd come at me like this when we were playing round, and I grabbed her wrist

867
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:37,350
And I'd knock her for her for her hamsters heard not close together. She used to just get completely annoyed about [that] and I thought

868
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:43,739
Right that's what you do you just opened your hands well. She didn't know that either

869
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:47,280
So she hadn't been played [with] enough when she was a little [rat] and so

870
01:05:49,759 --> 01:05:51,759
anyways

871
01:05:51,859 --> 01:05:55,028
Anyway, so you let the route the little rats. Go out there, right?

872
01:05:55,029 --> 01:06:00,518
And so let's imagine one [of] them is 10% bigger than other and so that the 10% bigger rat wins

873
01:06:01,009 --> 01:06:07,269
Because 10% is enough in rat way to ensure that you're going to be the pinner rather than the penny, okay?

874
01:06:07,269 --> 01:06:08,589
So so that's fine

875
01:06:08,589 --> 01:06:14,048
so a knit net the rat the rat pins the big rat pins a little rat and now the big rat is the is the

876
01:06:14,450 --> 01:06:16,450
Authority Rat and so then

877
01:06:16,789 --> 01:06:18,710
the next time that the rats play

878
01:06:18,710 --> 01:06:24,249
The little Rod has to invite the big rat to play so the big rats out there being cool and a little that pops up

879
01:06:24,249 --> 01:06:28,539
And you know does the whole will you play with me thing and the big rat will deign to play with it

880
01:06:28,579 --> 01:06:30,579
but if you pair them repeatedly

881
01:06:30,619 --> 01:06:36,008
unless the big rat lets the little rat win 30 percent of the time so little rat will not invite him to play and

882
01:06:36,499 --> 01:06:39,759
Panksepp discovered that it's like I read that that just blew me away

883
01:06:39,829 --> 01:06:41,829
it's like that is so

884
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:46,989
amazing because you see well first of their there's an analogy to psays ideas about the emergence of

885
01:06:47,119 --> 01:06:50,288
Morality out of play and human being so that was very cool

886
01:06:50,299 --> 01:06:55,508
But the notion that that was built in to rats at the level of wrestling was and their social

887
01:06:55,509 --> 01:07:00,879
They're deeply social animals right they have to know how [to] get along with [one] another and most of their authority

888
01:07:01,190 --> 01:07:07,479
Disputes dominance disputes, you don't want them to end in bloodshed and combat because you know if your rat won

889
01:07:07,479 --> 01:07:09,479
And I'm rat [2] and we tear each other to shreds

890
01:07:09,710 --> 01:07:14,319
In a dominance dispute rat 3 is just going to move in it's really not a great

891
01:07:14,749 --> 01:07:17,589
Strategy and so be better if we could settle our differences

892
01:07:17,749 --> 01:07:23,769
You know somewhat peacefully and so while so rat anyway peg's had figured out that rats

893
01:07:24,799 --> 01:07:28,959
Play and not only [did] they play they play fair and they [seemed] to enjoy it he also figured out

894
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:32,049
This was really cool [to] that if you give juvenile rats

895
01:07:32,930 --> 01:07:34,930
attention deficit disorder drugs

896
01:07:35,660 --> 01:07:37,309
Ritalin

897
01:07:37,309 --> 01:07:39,309
suppresses prey play

898
01:07:39,529 --> 01:07:43,299
So that's worth thinking about. It's like well. Why do you have to give?

899
01:07:44,239 --> 01:07:46,239
Juvenile Human beings

900
01:07:46,609 --> 01:07:53,318
Amphetamines in school well because they need to play well, you know they don't get to play you know get to wrestle around

901
01:07:53,319 --> 01:07:59,649
I mean that's oppression as far as I can tell they don't get to wrestle around that's fine feed them some amphetamines man

902
01:07:59,660 --> 01:08:06,970
[that'll] shut down the old play circuits. Well is the other problem is panksepp found out that if you don't let Juvenile male rats play?

903
01:08:07,760 --> 01:08:09,760
Their prefrontal cortexes don't develop properly

904
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:12,699
Surprise surprise, you're not letting them [ensure]

905
01:08:12,700 --> 01:08:18,790
It's like what else would you expect so you know that's something to think about really hard, I would say so

906
01:08:19,609 --> 01:08:24,099
Well, so there's some wolves going at it, [and] [we're] all [hunting] not exactly there's some moves

907
01:08:27,980 --> 01:08:29,980
having an Authority dispute, but

908
01:08:31,430 --> 01:08:33,430
More technically speaking

909
01:08:34,430 --> 01:08:38,499
And a lot of [its] posturing you know they tend they tend [not] well

910
01:08:38,660 --> 01:08:44,349
Socialized wolves tend not to hurt each other during authority disputes because well for over obvious reasons

911
01:08:44,350 --> 01:08:49,839
It's too dangerous and so they have other ways of demonstrating who should be listen to authorities

912
01:08:49,839 --> 01:08:56,439
And there's chimps doing you have this particular house. I think if I remember correctly I think it's right

913
01:08:56,440 --> 01:09:00,370
This is a really cool picture because I think this chimp chimps don't like snakes by the way

914
01:09:00,710 --> 01:09:03,520
So for example if you take a chimp that's never seen a snake

915
01:09:03,520 --> 01:09:09,279
And you show it a snake it is not. Happy it will get the hell away from that snake if you bring a chimp

916
01:09:10,100 --> 01:09:14,649
Anesthetized into a roomful of chimps the chips will all get away from that and then look at the body

917
01:09:14,650 --> 01:09:16,460
they don't like that either and

918
01:09:16,460 --> 01:09:21,669
if you bring a big snake into a chimp cage even if the chimps have never seen it like they'll get away from it and

919
01:09:21,670 --> 01:09:26,140
Then stare at it and chimps out in the wild if they see a big snake

920
01:09:26,270 --> 01:09:31,899
They'll they'll stand there and they have a noise that means it's like holy crap. That's a big snake you know

921
01:09:33,109 --> 01:09:35,739
It actually means that technically, I'll tell you why in a minute

922
01:09:38,839 --> 01:09:41,109
But they get they stand away from it then they make this this

923
01:09:41,420 --> 01:09:43,629
Noise which means oh my [God] look at the snake

924
01:09:43,630 --> 01:09:50,440
and then they'll stand there for like 24 hours looking at the snake and so the snakes are really really they're super stimuli for

925
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:51,220
Chimpanzees

926
01:09:51,220 --> 01:09:55,209
So that's pretty interesting in this chimp seem to learn how to take this dead snake and go

927
01:09:55,490 --> 01:09:57,490
scare other chips with it and that was

928
01:09:57,980 --> 01:10:02,620
That was hardly how he established his authority and you know and [while] there?

929
01:10:02,620 --> 01:10:06,910
There's a there's a there's a threat, and you like if I was you, [and] I was around that chimp

930
01:10:06,910 --> 01:10:09,669
I would take that threat seriously because those things are no joke man

931
01:10:09,670 --> 01:10:14,290
And you see the same thing here with the I don't remember what kind of monkey that is but they're engaged in

932
01:10:14,420 --> 01:10:16,420
agonistic Behavior and so

933
01:10:17,030 --> 01:10:19,989
From so and there has been by the way there has been

934
01:10:20,420 --> 01:10:28,270
Recent research showing that in higher order primates that [there] is snake Detection circuitry that's built into them right so it's not learned

935
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:31,539
It's not learned deeper than that now for a long time

936
01:10:31,820 --> 01:10:36,849
Psychologist psychologist knew for a long time that I could make you afraid in a conditioning experience

937
01:10:37,220 --> 01:10:43,539
Experiment much faster using a snake or a picture of the snake than a gun or a picture of a gun

938
01:10:44,390 --> 01:10:49,450
So we can learn fear [to] snakes very rapidly spiders as well, and so then people thought well

939
01:10:49,450 --> 01:10:52,269
maybe we were prepared to develop fear to snakes or

940
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:54,380
spiders that sort of thing

941
01:10:54,380 --> 01:10:57,970
But the more recent research has indicated that it's more than just

942
01:10:58,250 --> 01:11:02,590
prepared is that we have the Detection circuitry built right into us and

943
01:11:03,320 --> 01:11:07,809
Well is because well why wouldn't we that's that's really the [issue]. It's like

944
01:11:07,810 --> 01:11:11,649
It's not really [that] much of a surprise unless you think of human beings as a blank slate

945
01:11:11,650 --> 01:11:16,750
And if you think that [been] I don't know you should crawl out of the 16th century

946
01:11:16,750 --> 01:11:21,609
That's that's all I would look I would look at it because I mean that's that's that's just go on that idea

947
01:11:22,760 --> 01:11:25,510
it's it's it's so wrong, so

948
01:11:27,710 --> 01:11:33,100
So maybe you can think about this as a dominance hierarchy, but wolves look for those wolves look for

949
01:11:34,190 --> 01:11:39,520
Credibility and competence as well and and chimpanzees don't like Brutal tyrants

950
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:45,430
And so we'll talk about it as the hierarchy of authority and so well. This is kind of how it starts to [develop]

951
01:11:45,430 --> 01:11:49,599
You know you see well these girls are negotiating the domestic environment here

952
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:53,350
and how to behave properly and how to share and all that and turn and take turns

953
01:11:53,350 --> 01:11:58,030
And so they're negotiating the hierarchy of authority and if you're good at reciprocity

954
01:11:58,030 --> 01:12:02,829
It's sometimes you're the authority and sometimes the other person is the authority that's fair play, right?

955
01:12:02,830 --> 01:12:06,550
And so these boys are doing the same thing and you see they're all smiling away

956
01:12:06,550 --> 01:12:10,929
And so it looks like aggressive behavior and people who are not?

957
01:12:11,679 --> 01:12:15,879
Very attentive and who are paranoid and who don't like?

958
01:12:17,150 --> 01:12:22,509
Human beings can confuse this with aggression and they forbid it at schools

959
01:12:22,510 --> 01:12:27,099
Which is you know I know when my kids were going to school for example. This was quite a while ago now

960
01:12:27,349 --> 01:12:31,509
They were forbidden to pick up snow on the off chance

961
01:12:31,579 --> 01:12:34,719
They might throw a snowball and we know how terrible that is

962
01:12:34,789 --> 01:12:40,779
So what I told my son was [that] he was perfectly welcome to pelt any teacher he wanted to in the back of the head

963
01:12:40,780 --> 01:12:42,969
with the snowball as long as he was willing to

964
01:12:43,579 --> 01:12:47,649
Suffer the consequences of doing it, and I don't know if he ever did

965
01:12:47,650 --> 01:12:52,209
But he was happy with he was certainly happy with the idea which made me very [happy] about him, so

966
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:58,959
Yeah, so so you know kids need to do this they really really

967
01:12:59,659 --> 01:13:01,360
Seriously need to do this

968
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:06,130
it's what civilize --is them and [they] that needs to happen [between] the ages of [two] and [four] because if they're not

969
01:13:06,199 --> 01:13:08,438
Civilized by the time they're [4] then you might as well

970
01:13:08,439 --> 01:13:11,439
Just forget it, and that's a that's a horrible statistic

971
01:13:11,439 --> 01:13:17,829
but it's unbelievably well borne out in the relevant developmental literature like there's lots of aggressive two-Year-olds most of them are male and

972
01:13:18,380 --> 01:13:24,339
If they stay aggressive past the age of four they tend to be lifetime aggressive. They make no friends. They're outcasts

973
01:13:24,340 --> 01:13:29,079
they're much more likely to end up antisocial criminal Delinquent and in jail and so

974
01:13:29,689 --> 01:13:32,379
Your kids need to be socialized between the ages of two and four

975
01:13:32,380 --> 01:13:39,880
And that's particularly true for the more aggressive males and most of the rest of two-year-olds are male and that isn't socialization by the way

976
01:13:40,579 --> 01:13:44,498
So there's a [more--not] more abstract representation of the same sort of thing

977
01:13:44,499 --> 01:13:49,958
And I'm trying to make the case [that] this that the that the hierarchy of authority emerges out of a [game-like]

978
01:13:50,719 --> 01:13:52,868
Matrix an Underlying Game-like Matrix

979
01:13:52,869 --> 01:13:57,489
And that's one of the things that one of the things that's so brilliant about Jean Piaget he figured that out

980
01:13:57,489 --> 01:14:05,198
it's so smart and he was interested in the biological origin of morality and he identified it he he he

981
01:14:05,959 --> 01:14:11,379
Traced the origin to play and the emergence of morality out of play, and that's it's so smart

982
01:14:11,380 --> 01:14:15,609
[it's] just I [just] can't believe how smart an idea that was because it's the [bottom-up]

983
01:14:16,760 --> 01:14:18,760
construction of of

984
01:14:18,769 --> 01:14:23,169
Morality now Piaget was [a] constructionist and to some degree social constructionist

985
01:14:23,170 --> 01:14:30,250
He underestimated the role of biology, but that doesn't invalidate his theory. It's really easy to put a biological underpinning underneath

986
01:14:30,770 --> 01:14:37,060
underneath pas theory, we know the biology well enough to do it quite quite nicely now so I mean we

987
01:14:37,730 --> 01:14:43,209
well the fact that tanks have for example [could] identify the play circuit is a really good start with that right because

988
01:14:43,610 --> 01:14:50,229
Play has been around so [long] that. We have a circuit. That's dedicated to it and so that's that's a very very ancient

989
01:14:50,480 --> 01:14:51,880
That's a very ancient issue

990
01:14:51,880 --> 01:14:57,279
And so you know this is this is very much of an abstraction of a game here, and then of course you get the ultimate

991
01:14:57,860 --> 01:15:01,449
abstraction in representation, what in a representation like

992
01:15:02,840 --> 01:15:04,130
like that

993
01:15:04,130 --> 01:15:11,619
Where even though even the landscape of the game is fictional and of course we've migrated to a large degree [into] those sorts of fictional

994
01:15:11,620 --> 01:15:12,890
landscapes

995
01:15:12,890 --> 01:15:14,890
fictional books movies

996
01:15:15,770 --> 01:15:16,670
video games

997
01:15:16,670 --> 01:15:21,879
so it's the same it's an extension of the same thing so practice for

998
01:15:22,250 --> 01:15:26,560
practice for real life the Shades in some cases into real life itself, so

999
01:15:30,140 --> 01:15:31,910
Alright

1000
01:15:31,910 --> 01:15:36,220
More representations of God the father I like these representations. I like the triangle

1001
01:15:37,160 --> 01:15:42,369
Idea I mean I [don't] know why God is wearing a triangular hat it's kind of a strange fashion choice

1002
01:15:42,370 --> 01:15:43,310
but I think it's

1003
01:15:43,310 --> 01:15:49,090
Associated with the idea of the pyramid and I think that's associated with the idea of the hierarchy of Authority and I think that's why

1004
01:15:49,090 --> 01:15:51,699
the Egyptians put their pharaohs inside pyramids

1005
01:15:51,700 --> 01:15:53,050
I know, there's more to it than [that]

1006
01:15:53,050 --> 01:15:58,869
But I think some of that has [to] do with the notion of this hierarchical structure you see this on that now

1007
01:15:58,870 --> 01:16:02,050
that's speculative obviously and I don't want to make too much [of] it, but

1008
01:16:02,570 --> 01:16:06,999
But I can't help but think that there's something to that see that's on the back of [the] American Dollar Bill

1009
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:08,240
I like that a lot

1010
01:16:08,240 --> 01:16:12,309
[that's] like the eye of horus from the egyptians and so the idea here is something like

1011
01:16:12,680 --> 01:16:16,689
At the top of the Hierarchy is something that is no longer part of the hierarchy

1012
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:24,039
Right, so if you move up the hierarchy enough what happens is [that] you develop the [ability] as a consequence of moving up that hierarchy

1013
01:16:24,040 --> 01:16:27,760
To be detached enough from the Hierarchy, so you're no longer really part of it

1014
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:33,010
And so [that] you can move in all sorts of different hierarchies and the thing the idea here is [that] the thing [that] you're really?

1015
01:16:33,200 --> 01:16:38,650
Developing is the capacity to pay attention, and I would say from a from

1016
01:16:39,410 --> 01:16:45,070
mythological perspective the the one thing that seems to compete with the idea of the spoken word as

1017
01:16:45,230 --> 01:16:47,530
the as the source of the

1018
01:16:48,230 --> 01:16:56,020
Extraction of habitable order from Chaos is the [I] is the capacity to pay attention so marduk for example the mesopotamian creator. God who?

1019
01:16:56,840 --> 01:16:58,840
emerged in the hierarchy of

1020
01:16:58,850 --> 01:17:02,379
Mesopotamian gods and came out at the top right he was the victor of the gods

1021
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:07,030
He had eyes all the way around his head and he could speak Magic words, and I really like that

1022
01:17:07,030 --> 01:17:12,009
I really like that idea and the egyptians developed that idea too because their God horus was the eye

1023
01:17:12,440 --> 01:17:17,890
Everyone knew was the eye of [horus] that that sense that image is so compelling that we still know [about]

1024
01:17:17,960 --> 01:17:21,669
everybody has seen the eye of [horus] with a really open pupil and

1025
01:17:22,100 --> 01:17:29,229
What the egyptians learned was that the open eye was what revivified the dead society it's so smart

1026
01:17:29,230 --> 01:17:34,419
So what do you do if your life? Isn't in order bloody well pay attention and that isn't the same as thinking

1027
01:17:34,420 --> 01:17:39,850
It's a different process paying attention thinking is like the imposition of structure in some sense

1028
01:17:39,850 --> 01:17:45,340
I know I'm oversimplifying but paying attention is something like watching for what you don't know and

1029
01:17:45,590 --> 01:17:50,619
So like one of the things I often recommend to my clinical clients if they're having trouble with a family member is

1030
01:17:50,900 --> 01:17:56,470
Number one, shut up. Don't tell them anything about yourself just and I don't mean in a rude way

1031
01:17:56,470 --> 01:17:58,629
It's just like no more personal information

1032
01:17:59,180 --> 01:18:04,240
number [two] watch them like a hawk and listen and if you do that long enough

1033
01:18:04,430 --> 01:18:06,310
They will tell you exactly what they're up to

1034
01:18:06,310 --> 01:18:13,030
And they will also tell you who they [think] you are and then you'll be shocked because they think you're something generally speaking

1035
01:18:13,030 --> 01:18:17,800
That's not like you what you are at all and when they tell you it's like a revelation to both of you

1036
01:18:17,830 --> 01:18:22,450
But attention [is] an unbelievably powerful force, and you see this in psychotherapy

1037
01:18:22,450 --> 01:18:24,459
Too because a lot of what you do and in any

1038
01:18:24,800 --> 01:18:28,419
Reparative relationship is really pay attention to another person

1039
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:29,890
pay attention and listen

1040
01:18:29,890 --> 01:18:30,410
and

1041
01:18:30,410 --> 01:18:37,329
you would not believe what people will tell [you] or reveal to you if you watch them as if you want to know instead of

1042
01:18:37,330 --> 01:18:39,330
watching them so that you'll have your

1043
01:18:39,470 --> 01:18:40,760
prejudices

1044
01:18:40,760 --> 01:18:45,909
Reinforced that's usually how people interact is like. I want to keep thinking about you the way

1045
01:18:45,910 --> 01:18:50,320
I'm thinking about you, and so I'm going to filter out anything that just proves my theory

1046
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:52,449
That's not what I'm talking about at all. It's like

1047
01:18:52,989 --> 01:18:56,768
I'm going to watch you and figure [out] what you're up to. [not] in a rude way none of [that]

1048
01:18:56,769 --> 01:19:00,399
I just want to see what's there and that'll be good for you

1049
01:19:00,920 --> 01:19:05,920
Probably and also be good for me, and so well, so that's the idea that

1050
01:19:05,920 --> 01:19:10,509
you know climbing up a hierarchy of authority can give you vision and that vision can

1051
01:19:11,119 --> 01:19:15,609
transcend the actual Hierarchy, and I think that's also the I think that's also the

1052
01:19:17,059 --> 01:19:23,229
That's the metaphysical space that an artist occupies because artists really aren't in a hierarchy there outside of hierarchies

1053
01:19:23,230 --> 01:19:26,259
You've watched the Lion king most of you yeah

1054
01:19:27,260 --> 01:19:29,139
That's that Zoo you know the little bird

1055
01:19:29,139 --> 01:19:35,229
that's the eye of the king that's the same thing there so and that's that's echoed in this idea as well, so

1056
01:19:35,960 --> 01:19:37,960
So well that's some more

1057
01:19:39,079 --> 01:19:42,909
More ideas of Hierarchies same idea. This is right gold

1058
01:19:44,239 --> 01:19:49,029
Silver Bronze, why gold gold is the sun [gold] is pure right?

1059
01:19:49,030 --> 01:19:55,780
So the idea is that the thing that's at the top of the hierarchy is incorruptible because gold doesn't mix with anything else, right?

1060
01:19:55,780 --> 01:19:59,320
It's this sort of metal that doesn't ever become corrupted. It's a noble metal

1061
01:19:59,320 --> 01:20:02,019
It doesn't become corrupted, and so it Shines like the sun

1062
01:20:02,019 --> 01:20:06,009
And it's associated with what's ever at the top of the [hierarchy] and the gold

1063
01:20:06,380 --> 01:20:10,359
The gold Medal is a disc like the sun, and it's awarded to those people who?

1064
01:20:11,329 --> 01:20:18,038
Occupied the top position and who are manifestations of the ideal and here's here's I can tell you a quick story

1065
01:20:18,349 --> 01:20:20,558
[so] imagine that you're watching an olympic contest

1066
01:20:20,679 --> 01:20:25,868
[I] found this happens to me very often with gymnastics because the gymnasts are so absolutely unbelievable you know

1067
01:20:25,999 --> 01:20:28,479
so you go watch the gymnastic performance and

1068
01:20:29,449 --> 01:20:31,449
the verse is out there bouncing around like

1069
01:20:33,769 --> 01:20:39,159
You know you can't even imagine doing it. They're so perfect at it. So you see this person they're going through this routine

1070
01:20:39,159 --> 01:20:40,190
They're just absolutely

1071
01:20:40,190 --> 01:20:43,059
Spectacular and flawless at it. You know at the [end]

1072
01:20:43,059 --> 01:20:48,489
They stop and everybody claps and and they're all excited to see what a human being can do and that's why we're in the audience

1073
01:20:48,489 --> 01:20:53,888
Watching because we want to see what a human being can do and the judges go like 9.8 9.8 9.8

1074
01:20:53,929 --> 01:20:57,609
Everybody's thrilled and then the next contestant comes out, and it's [like] well

1075
01:20:57,610 --> 01:21:01,239
They're just basically screwed right it's like this person came out there and was perfect

1076
01:21:01,239 --> 01:21:05,529
How are you going to top that that's an interesting question because this

1077
01:21:06,310 --> 01:21:09,249
Is a representation of what you do to top?

1078
01:21:09,770 --> 01:21:13,089
Perfection itself and you can do it [and] here's how you do it

1079
01:21:13,090 --> 01:21:17,770
And you know this even though you don't know you know it, so let's say the next contestant comes out

1080
01:21:17,770 --> 01:21:22,450
They're kind of shaky because it's like oh man the bar is being raised high so what they do is

1081
01:21:23,030 --> 01:21:25,899
they put themselves right on the edge of Chaos and

1082
01:21:26,630 --> 01:21:32,410
You can tell by watching them that they are one bloody fraction of a second from Catastrophe

1083
01:21:32,720 --> 01:21:37,030
[they're] pushing themselves farther than they've ever gone in the direction of their perfection [and]

1084
01:21:37,370 --> 01:21:42,609
Everyone in the room is so tense they can hardly stand it right you can hear a pin drop and that person is flipping around

1085
01:21:42,610 --> 01:21:47,050
It they're just it's just right on the edge of catastrophe [and] at the end

1086
01:21:47,050 --> 01:21:48,160
They go like this, you know

1087
01:21:48,160 --> 01:21:55,510
And there's that gesture of triumph that goes along with that and everybody rises in one instant and just claps like mad

1088
01:21:55,510 --> 01:22:00,039
It's like well, why what are you doing? What are you doing? When you're doing that right?

1089
01:22:00,040 --> 01:22:04,720
You can't even help it it grabs you right in the core of your being and you stand up

1090
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:08,079
And it's it's an act of worship. That's what it is and you saw someone

1091
01:22:08,630 --> 01:22:14,740
Go Beyond their perfection into the domain of Chaos and establish order right in front of your eyes

1092
01:22:14,740 --> 01:22:18,309
And you're so thrilled about that you know you're happy to be alive

1093
01:22:18,310 --> 01:22:25,300
And everyone's celebrating it all at the same time, and it's an absolutely amazing thing, and that's what well sometimes

1094
01:22:25,300 --> 01:22:28,239
That's what this represents and sometimes that's what this represents

1095
01:22:28,240 --> 01:22:33,550
And that's what we're trying to get at because that's at the pinnacle of the hierarchy right not only are you doing?

1096
01:22:33,550 --> 01:22:35,330
What you should be [doing]?

1097
01:22:35,330 --> 01:22:40,059
but you're doing it in a way that increases the probability that you'll do it better the next time you do it and

1098
01:22:40,250 --> 01:22:44,080
[then] you could say here's another thing to think about along the same lines

1099
01:22:44,840 --> 01:22:46,840
And I know we haven't got that [out] of an easy yet

1100
01:22:50,780 --> 01:22:56,530
You tell your kids to play fair right you say [Norman] it's not [whether] [not] you win. It's how you play the game and

1101
01:22:57,200 --> 01:23:00,819
You say that you don't really know what you mean you feel kind of stupid saying it even though

1102
01:23:00,820 --> 01:23:05,230
You know it's true and your kid looks at you like there's something wrong with you because he doesn't know what you're talking about either

1103
01:23:05,300 --> 01:23:07,300
but you know it's true [and]

1104
01:23:07,460 --> 01:23:09,460
So here's why it's true

1105
01:23:11,540 --> 01:23:14,830
Life isn't a game. It's a set of games and

1106
01:23:15,350 --> 01:23:20,409
The rule is never Sacrifice victory across the set of games for victory and one game

1107
01:23:21,350 --> 01:23:23,350
Right and that's what it means to play

1108
01:23:23,630 --> 01:23:28,540
Properly you want to play so that people keep inviting you [to] play because that's how you win

1109
01:23:29,090 --> 01:23:35,230
Right you win by being invited to play the largest possible array of games and the way you do that is by

1110
01:23:35,480 --> 01:23:40,989
Manifesting the fact that you can play in a reciprocal manner every time you play even if there's victory at stake

1111
01:23:40,989 --> 01:23:43,329
And that's what makes you successful across time

1112
01:23:43,330 --> 01:23:49,119
And we all know that and we even tell our kids that but we don't know [that] we know it and so we're not

1113
01:23:49,790 --> 01:23:52,239
adapting ourselves to the game and Victory in the game

1114
01:23:52,239 --> 01:23:58,839
We're adapting ourselves to the [metagame] and victory across the set of all possible games, and that's what that well

1115
01:23:58,840 --> 01:24:04,569
That's exactly what as far as I can tell that's exactly what this is aiming at to that. That's the same idea that

1116
01:24:04,570 --> 01:24:11,920
There's that there's a transit. There's a mode of being that transcends the particularities of [the] of the localized contests

1117
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:15,909
That's the other way to think about it and to act morally is not to win

1118
01:24:16,310 --> 01:24:21,129
today's contest at the expense of the rest of possible contests and

1119
01:24:21,710 --> 01:24:25,149
Again, I don't see that as something that's arbitrary it's not relativistic

1120
01:24:25,610 --> 01:24:31,029
there's an absolute Moral an absolute Moral stance there and everyone recognizes it and

1121
01:24:31,850 --> 01:24:33,850
And I also think it's the key to success

1122
01:24:33,850 --> 01:24:40,989
and I would also say it's very much akin in a strange way like the the the person who is the master at

1123
01:24:41,270 --> 01:24:46,719
Being invited to play the largest possible games number of games is also the same person

1124
01:24:46,719 --> 01:24:53,109
I haven't quite figured out the precise [relationship] between these two is also the same person that goes out

1125
01:24:53,360 --> 01:25:00,699
Forthrightly to conquer the unknown before it presents itself as the enemy at the door. They're the same thing now

1126
01:25:00,699 --> 01:25:03,908
I don't I can't haven't figured well. Why that is exactly but but

1127
01:25:04,790 --> 01:25:08,049
Well, I'll figure it out eventually and when I do I'll don't tell you well

1128
01:25:08,780 --> 01:25:10,780
if you're interested, so

1129
01:25:10,969 --> 01:25:13,599
okay, so here's the mother no ideas of

1130
01:25:14,300 --> 01:25:16,300
God as as

1131
01:25:16,520 --> 01:25:24,279
Hierarchical authority figures so strip the religious preconceptions off what you observe and just look at what you see well look there's primate

1132
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:26,570
looking upward Ad

1133
01:25:26,570 --> 01:25:29,199
Dominance figure, that's that's what you see there now

1134
01:25:29,449 --> 01:25:31,070
It's very interestingly

1135
01:25:31,070 --> 01:25:31,699
symbolically

1136
01:25:31,699 --> 01:25:33,040
Represented because you have gone

1137
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:38,709
The farther there with the cross and I think what that [means] as far as I can tell is [that] there's a recognition there in

1138
01:25:38,710 --> 01:25:45,490
the image that the person who's most dominant is the one who's or the most have the most [authority] is the one who's

1139
01:25:46,010 --> 01:25:50,530
Voluntarily accepted the suffering that's part of being and that's what that picture represents

1140
01:25:50,530 --> 01:25:58,479
It's like the authority holds that says this is what you have to accept and that that that that transfix is the viewer

1141
01:25:58,970 --> 01:26:03,909
Because of because of the fact that it's true, and you think well is that true, okay? Well think about it this way?

1142
01:26:04,120 --> 01:26:06,120
Do you like brave people or do you like cowards?

1143
01:26:06,530 --> 01:26:10,059
Well that that's pretty straightforward and what's the ultimate act of Bravery?

1144
01:26:10,340 --> 01:26:15,220
It's to come to terms with the fact that you're mortal and limited and to live forthrightly

1145
01:26:15,860 --> 01:26:23,140
Regardless well obviously that's at the core of what's of what's admirable and why would we presume that that's not the case

1146
01:26:23,390 --> 01:26:29,919
We act as if that's the case. It's what everyone dreams and wishes that they could they could do I mean assuming that?

1147
01:26:30,470 --> 01:26:33,429
You know you've dispensed with the idea that you're going to be immortal

1148
01:26:33,430 --> 01:26:38,680
I suppose that might be worth wishing for [too] or or perhaps not immortal is a very long time

1149
01:26:38,900 --> 01:26:42,069
But you certainly want this and that [image] says well

1150
01:26:42,070 --> 01:26:45,100
This is what you should be and you [know] we've got that same

1151
01:26:45,260 --> 01:26:49,239
Opening into the sky going on in that image that I showed you before it's like

1152
01:26:49,240 --> 01:26:56,919
This is a transcendent truth that constantly reman efest itself across time and space and jung would say it's built into your psyche that

1153
01:26:57,050 --> 01:27:03,370
Image now you know there are elements of it [that] are culturally constructed it wouldn't [necessarily] have to be the cross

1154
01:27:03,700 --> 01:27:09,909
Although the cross is a very old symbol. It's far older than then it's use in Christianity. It has been used in many many

1155
01:27:10,490 --> 01:27:11,960
religious

1156
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:16,569
representations, but that echoes the soul echoes with that you know and

1157
01:27:18,920 --> 01:27:22,270
Well, then there's moses up there on [the] on the mount

1158
01:27:22,820 --> 01:27:28,299
Receiving these the the law and so we'll talk a lot more about that when we get to exodus

1159
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:34,030
but if yeah yeah, yeah

1160
01:27:35,450 --> 01:27:42,849
If we get to exodus so well look where does it happen well on the mountain. Well, that's a pyramid

1161
01:27:42,850 --> 01:27:49,629
That's up right. That's optics up. It's it's up in stratosphere is up in the sky where where you look upward, okay?

1162
01:27:49,630 --> 01:27:52,180
And and then so what's happening to moses well here?

1163
01:27:52,180 --> 01:27:54,700
Here's a bit of a clue as far as I can tell [I]

1164
01:27:55,130 --> 01:28:00,040
Figured this out partly again by reading jean Piaget because one of the things that pSA said about kids was that

1165
01:28:00,620 --> 01:28:02,230
They first learned to play a game

1166
01:28:02,230 --> 01:28:07,270
But they don't know what the rules are meaning that if you have a bunch of kids together they can play a game

1167
01:28:07,400 --> 01:28:11,410
but if you take one of the kids out of the game when they're young say six, and you say

1168
01:28:11,410 --> 01:28:14,859
What the rule are what are the rules they can only sort of give you a representation?

1169
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:21,549
So you take six-year-old one and he'll tell you some of the rules and six-year-old two will tell you different rules and and you know

1170
01:28:21,890 --> 01:28:27,280
Six-year-Old three will tell you different rules, but if you put them all together they can play so they have the knowledge

1171
01:28:27,800 --> 01:28:31,510
Embodied either individually or [in] the group the knowledge is there

1172
01:28:31,910 --> 01:28:36,249
to be extracted well then they get a little older they can extract the rules and

1173
01:28:36,860 --> 01:28:40,960
Then they start to play by the rules [and] then the CSA's last step was well

1174
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:44,680
they didn't just the kids play by the rules that they learned that they can make the rules and

1175
01:28:44,840 --> 01:28:49,960
He thought about that as moral progression first you can play then you can play by the rules then you learn

1176
01:28:49,960 --> 01:28:56,140
Maybe because he didn't think everyone learned this that you're actually the master of the rules [that] [doesn't] mean the rules are arbitrary

1177
01:28:56,360 --> 01:28:58,100
But it means that

1178
01:28:58,100 --> 01:29:01,930
You could be the generator of the rule that's assuming that you know how to play the game

1179
01:29:01,930 --> 01:29:04,569
And he thought about that as a Moral Moral progression

1180
01:29:04,570 --> 01:29:10,600
And then I thought well that's exactly what happened [to] moses in in the story of exodus because moses is out there leading all those

1181
01:29:10,600 --> 01:29:14,350
Israelites around and like they don't have a law they don't have a lawgiver

1182
01:29:14,530 --> 01:29:19,599
They have a tradition, and they're all like crabby because both are in a desert. It's like

1183
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:23,739
They're in a tyranny, but now they're in a desert. It's like. That's no improvement

1184
01:29:23,740 --> 01:29:25,690
So they're really getting pretty bitchy about it

1185
01:29:25,690 --> 01:29:31,990
and so they're worshipping False idols and having one catastrophe after another and they get moses to judge their

1186
01:29:33,590 --> 01:29:40,299
Conflicts so he does that for God only knows how long forever crabby israelites come to moses and bitch at him

1187
01:29:40,300 --> 01:29:44,530
It's like wow he did this and she did that and and so then he has to figure out how

1188
01:29:44,810 --> 01:29:45,880
[to] make peace

1189
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:46,370
and

1190
01:29:46,370 --> 01:29:51,490
He does that so long that one of his I think it's his father-in-law tells him he has to stop doing it because he's going

1191
01:29:51,490 --> 01:29:55,119
To exhaust himself [well] then you think well, what's happening? Well?

1192
01:29:55,760 --> 01:30:01,059
And I'm not assuming that this is a like a literal historical story. I think again

1193
01:30:01,060 --> 01:30:06,009
It's a condensation. Well any group has a set of customs

1194
01:30:06,260 --> 01:30:13,150
Just like a wolf pack does and so then the customs are being manifest in someone. Who's a genius is watching and thinking okay?

1195
01:30:13,150 --> 01:30:20,020
Well, what's the rule in this situation? What's the rule in this situation? What's the rule in this situation and then in his imagination

1196
01:30:20,600 --> 01:30:26,529
[the] rules turn into a hierarchy and then he goes up on the mountain [just] bang and he thinks oh my God

1197
01:30:26,660 --> 01:30:33,129
Here's the rules that we've been living by all this time, and that's the revelation of the commandments well, and you think well

1198
01:30:33,130 --> 01:30:39,370
How else could it be you think the rules came first and baying them came second? It's like no the rules come first

1199
01:30:40,280 --> 01:30:44,259
Sorry the actions come first the obeying them comes first

1200
01:30:44,260 --> 01:30:49,180
And then you figure out what everybody's up to you say hey look this is what you've been up to all [along] everybody goes oh

1201
01:30:49,190 --> 01:30:53,680
Yeah, that seems to make sense peak and if it didn't who would follow them

1202
01:30:53,930 --> 01:31:00,939
no one was going to follow them if they don't match what's already there you just think about that is unjust and so that's that's

1203
01:31:01,250 --> 01:31:03,170
portrayed here as A

1204
01:31:03,170 --> 01:31:09,940
Cataclysmic human event it's like oh my God we've been chimpanzees. We've been in this hierarchy of authority for so long

1205
01:31:09,940 --> 01:31:14,290
we have no idea what we're doing and all of a sudden poof it bursts into

1206
01:31:14,930 --> 01:31:21,309
Revelatory consciousness, and we could say here is the law and you say well is it given by God well?

1207
01:31:21,590 --> 01:31:26,410
Hey it depends on what you [mean] [by] God we could start with [that] presupposition, but it's not like it

1208
01:31:26,410 --> 01:31:30,910
Just came out of nowhere it took it and this is something else Nietzsche observed

1209
01:31:30,910 --> 01:31:36,220
so interestingly, and he said you know that a moral revelation was the consequence of a

1210
01:31:36,950 --> 01:31:40,029
tremendously long process of initial

1211
01:31:40,670 --> 01:31:46,060
construction and then formulation thousands and thousands and thousands and thousands of years of

1212
01:31:46,640 --> 01:31:50,890
custom a building custom before you get the revelation of the

1213
01:31:51,320 --> 01:31:56,860
Articulated law and that's a description of the pattern [that] works. Let's say well. What's the pattern that works?

1214
01:31:57,470 --> 01:32:02,829
It's the game that you can [play] with everybody else day after day with no degeneration

1215
01:32:02,930 --> 01:32:08,469
And that's another thing piaget figured out. It's so brilliant, and that's his idea of the equilibrate state

1216
01:32:08,630 --> 01:32:16,270
it's an extension of the [menu'] accounts idea about the universe [Maksim] right act in a way so that each action could become a

1217
01:32:16,460 --> 01:32:23,740
Universal rule that was Kinda Mental Moral Maxim and PSa put a twist on that. He said no, no, that's not exactly yet. [it's]

1218
01:32:24,530 --> 01:32:27,369
Act in such a way that it works for you now

1219
01:32:27,370 --> 01:32:33,820
And next week and next month and next year and ten years from now and so that while it's working for you

1220
01:32:33,820 --> 01:32:37,539
it's also working for the people around you and for the broader society and

1221
01:32:37,700 --> 01:32:40,179
Then and that's the equilibrate estate

1222
01:32:40,180 --> 01:32:44,709
And you could think about that as an intimation of [the] [kingdom] of the city of God on Earth

1223
01:32:44,710 --> 01:32:45,850
It's something like that

1224
01:32:45,850 --> 01:32:49,149
And it's based on this idea that a morality has to be iterable

1225
01:32:49,150 --> 01:32:56,410
And you know there's lots of there's been lots of simulations online already artificial intelligence simulations of trading games

1226
01:32:56,720 --> 01:33:01,990
Right I mean the people who've been studying the emergence of Moral behavior say in artificial intelligence

1227
01:33:02,270 --> 01:33:08,649
Systems have already caught on to the idea that one of the crucial elements to the analysis of morality is inner ability

1228
01:33:08,860 --> 01:33:11,380
you can't play a degenerating game because

1229
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:13,910
Because it degenerates

1230
01:33:13,910 --> 01:33:20,439
Like obviously you want to play a game that at least [remains] stable across time and God if you could really get your act together

1231
01:33:20,630 --> 01:33:25,480
Maybe it would slowly get better and of course that's what you'd hope for your family, right?

1232
01:33:25,700 --> 01:33:30,760
That's what you're always trying to do unless you're completely hell-bent on revenge and destruction

1233
01:33:30,760 --> 01:33:36,309
It's like is there a way that we can continue to play together that will make playing together even better the next day

1234
01:33:36,770 --> 01:33:38,770
that's what you're up to and

1235
01:33:40,340 --> 01:33:43,629
Well, I don't see anything arbitrary about that [and] part of it. This is also

1236
01:33:43,630 --> 01:33:50,470
why I think that bloody post modernists are so incorrect because you know they say something like there's an infinite number of interpretations of

1237
01:33:50,750 --> 01:33:52,840
The world and that's actually true

1238
01:33:53,420 --> 01:33:55,990
But then they make a mistake and they say well, no

1239
01:33:56,690 --> 01:34:00,640
Interpretation is to be privileged over any other interpretation. It's like wrong

1240
01:34:01,520 --> 01:34:06,640
wrong that's that's where things go seriously off the rails because the

1241
01:34:06,950 --> 01:34:08,950
Interpretation has to be and this is the piagetian

1242
01:34:08,960 --> 01:34:13,240
Objection is like if you and I are going to play a game rule one is we both have to want to play

1243
01:34:13,790 --> 01:34:19,149
Rule two is other people are going to let us play rule 3 is we should be able to play it across a pretty long

1244
01:34:19,340 --> 01:34:25,309
Period of time without it degenerating and maybe rule 4 is well. We're playing the world shouldn't kill us

1245
01:34:25,830 --> 01:34:30,590
It's like there are not very many [gay] like you don't send your kids out to play on the superhighway, right?

1246
01:34:30,690 --> 01:34:35,539
So they're not playing hockey on the superhighway because the world kills them and so

1247
01:34:36,210 --> 01:34:38,449
There's an infinite [number] of interpretations

1248
01:34:38,450 --> 01:34:41,780
But there is not an infinite number of solutions [and] the solutions are

1249
01:34:41,940 --> 01:34:48,019
Constrained by the fact of the world and are suffering in the world and then also constrained by the fact that we constrain each other

1250
01:34:48,020 --> 01:34:52,999
And so that's that's where. I think that's gone like dreadfully dreadfully wrong, so

1251
01:34:54,150 --> 01:34:56,150
All right

1252
01:35:05,040 --> 01:35:09,800
It's really fun to look at these old pictures once you kind of know what they mean, you know the leaf

1253
01:35:09,800 --> 01:35:14,179
That's what I've discovered. Is that once I kind of understand the underlying

1254
01:35:14,970 --> 01:35:20,449
Rationale for I mean someone worked hard on that that's an engraving right they took a long time making that picture

1255
01:35:20,450 --> 01:35:23,269
They're serious about it and when you understand what it means

1256
01:35:25,110 --> 01:35:32,299
You know all those people there their prostate prostrate at the at the at the revelation of the law?

1257
01:35:32,660 --> 01:35:33,680
It's like well, no wonder

1258
01:35:33,680 --> 01:35:38,360
It's like break the law and see what happens breaks the universal Moral law man and see what happens

1259
01:35:38,550 --> 01:35:40,440
You know I see people in that situation

1260
01:35:40,440 --> 01:35:44,599
Well as you all do all the time perhaps me more than you because I'm a clinical psychologist

1261
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:48,049
you know and if the people I'm seeing haven't broken the

1262
01:35:48,150 --> 01:35:52,909
Universal law then you can bloody well be sure that people around them have it's no joke

1263
01:35:53,190 --> 01:36:00,139
Like you make a mistake and things will go seriously wrong for you, and so it's no wonder that. You'd be

1264
01:36:01,410 --> 01:36:07,610
Terrified at the revelation of the structure that governs our being one of the things that's so remarkable about the old testament

1265
01:36:07,610 --> 01:36:13,099
This is another thing Nietzsche commented on: he was a real admirer of the old testament not so much of the new testament

1266
01:36:13,100 --> 01:36:17,720
He thought it was a sin for Europe to have glued the new testament on to the old testament

1267
01:36:18,090 --> 01:36:20,299
[because] he thought the old testament was a really accurate

1268
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:24,740
representation of the phenomenology of Being. It's like

1269
01:36:25,470 --> 01:36:28,729
stay awake speak properly be honest or

1270
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:30,300
Watch the hell out

1271
01:36:30,300 --> 01:36:35,929
Because things will come your [way] that you just do not want to see at all and it might not [just] be you it might

1272
01:36:35,930 --> 01:36:42,589
Be everyone you know and everything about your culture that is demolished for for generation after generation. It's like

1273
01:36:43,170 --> 01:36:44,840
Stay awake and be careful

1274
01:36:44,840 --> 01:36:50,420
And I like I think that people only don't believe that when they're being hubristic

1275
01:36:50,460 --> 01:36:53,720
And I think that most people know that deep in their hearts

1276
01:36:53,720 --> 01:36:58,909
You know when you get high on your horse that happens fairly often if you have any sense you think geez I better be careful

1277
01:36:59,490 --> 01:37:02,929
[top] myself down and fare a bit because if I get too puffed up man

1278
01:37:03,030 --> 01:37:08,509
Something's going to come along and take me out at the knees and everyone knows that pride comes before a fall

1279
01:37:08,510 --> 01:37:12,889
It's like if you have any that's why it says in the old [testament] that fear of God is the beginning of wisdom

1280
01:37:13,170 --> 01:37:19,190
[it's] like I've never in all my years as a clinical psychologist, and this is something that really does terrify me

1281
01:37:19,220 --> 01:37:26,720
I have I have never seen anyone ever get away with anything at all even once you [know]

1282
01:37:26,720 --> 01:37:31,339
There's that old idea that. God has a book you know and keeps track of everything in heaven. It's like okay

1283
01:37:31,340 --> 01:37:33,470
Okay, [you] know maybe it's not a book

1284
01:37:34,080 --> 01:37:35,100
fine

1285
01:37:35,100 --> 01:37:39,740
But that is a really useful thing to think about because well, maybe you disagree

1286
01:37:39,750 --> 01:37:41,959
Maybe you think people get away with things all the time

1287
01:37:41,960 --> 01:37:44,689
I tell you I've never seen it what I see instead

1288
01:37:44,690 --> 01:37:49,069
is [that] thing happens right they someone twists the fabric of reality and

1289
01:37:49,440 --> 01:37:55,190
They do it successfully because it doesn't snap back at them that moment and then like two years later something

1290
01:37:55,410 --> 01:38:00,289
Unravels, and they get walloped and they think oh my God that's so unfair and then we track it

1291
01:38:00,290 --> 01:38:07,370
It's like but what happened before that this and then what this and then what this and then what oh?

1292
01:38:07,980 --> 01:38:14,299
Oh this well that's where it went wrong. It's yeah, because you can't twist the fabric of reality

1293
01:38:15,240 --> 01:38:17,240
without having it snap back

1294
01:38:17,340 --> 01:38:22,160
It doesn't work that way, [and] why would it because what are you going to do twist the fabric of reality?

1295
01:38:22,230 --> 01:38:23,600
I don't think so

1296
01:38:23,600 --> 01:38:25,879
I think it's bigger than you. You know

1297
01:38:25,880 --> 01:38:30,500
And I think that one of the things that really tempts people is the idea that well, I can get away with it

1298
01:38:30,500 --> 01:38:33,290
It's like yeah you try you see. Oh, well that works

1299
01:38:33,510 --> 01:38:39,889
It's like you get away with nothing and that is the beginning of wisdom and I it's something that deeply terrifies me

1300
01:38:39,890 --> 01:38:41,670
And you know err ever since?

1301
01:38:41,670 --> 01:38:43,200
last September when I

1302
01:38:43,200 --> 01:38:45,200
Came to Board like broader public

1303
01:38:45,240 --> 01:38:51,109
attention one of the thing I'd be terrified [of] making [mistake] because I certainly know I'm more than capable of making a mistake and

1304
01:38:51,560 --> 01:38:55,999
Going so far either. I haven't made [one] or no one found out about it, so

1305
01:38:56,670 --> 01:39:00,680
But it's like you know we walk on a very thin and narrow Edge

1306
01:39:00,680 --> 01:39:04,819
and we're very lucky when things aren't degenerating into Chaos around us or

1307
01:39:05,340 --> 01:39:07,550
Rapidly moving too far too much order

1308
01:39:07,550 --> 01:39:10,189
and it's not an easy thing to stay on that line and

1309
01:39:10,350 --> 01:39:16,249
You can tell when you say you're on that line because the things are deeply meaningful and engaging when you're on that line

1310
01:39:16,250 --> 01:39:17,790
but if you're not

1311
01:39:17,790 --> 01:39:23,240
Existentially terrified about the consequences of wavering off that then you are truly, not awake

1312
01:39:23,820 --> 01:39:26,360
So and that's what I see in this picture

1313
01:39:26,360 --> 01:39:32,030
You know it's like look out man, because there are rules and if you break them

1314
01:39:32,580 --> 01:39:34,580
God help you

1315
01:39:43,320 --> 01:39:48,620
so one of the things that seems to me the case with regard this in the question period A bit last time is that

1316
01:39:48,900 --> 01:39:51,680
one of the things that seems to be actually one of the

1317
01:39:51,900 --> 01:39:59,030
Advantages to gluing the new testament on to the old testament is the idea of a transformation and morality that is analogous to the pia

1318
01:39:59,030 --> 01:40:00,540
Jetty an idea that

1319
01:40:00,540 --> 01:40:06,589
After you learn to play [by] the rules you can learn to make the rules because I think that's actually what happens to some degree

1320
01:40:06,590 --> 01:40:09,410
in the transition between the [old] testament and the new testament

1321
01:40:10,290 --> 01:40:12,709
Because in the old testament most morality is prohibition

1322
01:40:13,230 --> 01:40:17,540
Here are things you shouldn't do. It's like no fair enough. That's a lot of what you do with your kids

1323
01:40:17,850 --> 01:40:19,850
Don't do this don't do this don't

1324
01:40:20,310 --> 01:40:25,370
Especially when they're happy you're always going around telling them to stop being so happy because all they're doing is causing trouble

1325
01:40:25,370 --> 01:40:29,720
It's quite painful if you're a parent and you notice that but the first morality is prohibition

1326
01:40:30,390 --> 01:40:31,410
right

1327
01:40:31,410 --> 01:40:35,720
Control yourself so you don't cause too much trouble and then maybe if you get that down

1328
01:40:35,720 --> 01:40:38,629
And you're good at it, then the next thing is well once you're disciplined

1329
01:40:39,300 --> 01:40:46,489
then you can start working [toward] something that's a positive good, and that's the transformation that seems to me to [be] fundamentally characteristic of the

1330
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:54,019
Juxtaposition of the new testament on to the old testament, but in these images is still something like serve tradition serve the father

1331
01:40:56,940 --> 01:40:59,990
psychologically speaking support the tradition because

1332
01:41:00,930 --> 01:41:01,970
You live on it

1333
01:41:01,970 --> 01:41:08,389
they're in an old mesopotamian story the enumeration you can which you can read about if you're interested [in] the

1334
01:41:08,700 --> 01:41:14,059
Original gods who are really badly behaved? They're like two year [old] in fact. They're a lot like two year olds

1335
01:41:14,550 --> 01:41:17,689
They kill the primordial gone absolute

1336
01:41:18,480 --> 01:41:21,320
Pea tree oracle God they kill him and try to live on his corpse

1337
01:41:22,020 --> 01:41:25,550
Well, that's what we all do right because we live on the corpse of our ancestors

1338
01:41:25,550 --> 01:41:27,320
You could say we live on the corpse of our culture

1339
01:41:27,320 --> 01:41:27,890
It's dead

1340
01:41:27,890 --> 01:41:32,329
And that's not a great place [to] live [so] you have to keep revivifying it so the damn thing

1341
01:41:32,490 --> 01:41:33,840
You know stays

1342
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:40,639
Active and awake you you stay [on] the carbs for too long and then the devil or the Demon of Chaos comes back

1343
01:41:40,640 --> 01:41:42,620
And that's what happens in the mesopotamian story

1344
01:41:42,620 --> 01:41:48,140
It's like don't be thinking that you can stay on the corpse of your ancestors for too long without

1345
01:41:48,750 --> 01:41:55,490
Contributing to the revivification of the system because the Chaos that all of that holds that that all that

1346
01:41:55,620 --> 01:41:59,930
holds that bay will definitely come and visit you you [see] that in stories like

1347
01:42:00,630 --> 01:42:06,890
The Hobbit you know hobbits. They're nice they like to eat. [they're] kind of fat. They're shorts are not very bright you know

1348
01:42:06,890 --> 01:42:10,129
They're hubristic. They have no idea. What's out there in the broader world

1349
01:42:10,320 --> 01:42:15,320
They're protected if you remember by the striders who are the sons of great Kings who look like?

1350
01:42:15,480 --> 01:42:20,930
Tramps they have nothing but contempt for them they patrol the borders and keep the Bloody hobbits safe

1351
01:42:21,120 --> 01:42:26,570
But out there out there in the periphery all hell is brewing and Chaos is is is

1352
01:42:27,300 --> 01:42:30,169
Generating and forming and that's an archetypal story

1353
01:42:30,170 --> 01:42:32,170
And that's why people like that story so much

1354
01:42:32,340 --> 01:42:36,049
Because that's exactly right [like] we're the hobbits and there are we are

1355
01:42:36,210 --> 01:42:42,500
Protected from Chaos by the spirits of our dead Ancestors, and we're too damn stupid to know it, and we think oh well

1356
01:42:42,500 --> 01:42:45,169
We don't need them anymore and that to me that's post-Modernism

1357
01:42:45,170 --> 01:42:50,750
That's what the bloody universities are doing with the humanities [to] absolutely appalling and we will pay for it

1358
01:42:50,970 --> 01:42:51,780
so

1359
01:42:51,780 --> 01:42:57,320
Unless we wake up, and hopefully we'll wake up because that would be better than paying for it even [though] being awake as well

1360
01:42:57,320 --> 01:42:58,650
[they're] painful

1361
01:42:58,650 --> 01:42:59,850
so

1362
01:42:59,850 --> 01:43:05,059
so then I had this vision one time and I kind of portrayed it in this in this image of

1363
01:43:05,460 --> 01:43:08,810
What the world was like and I thought well, it's not a pyramid

1364
01:43:08,970 --> 01:43:12,409
It's not a single Hierarchy of authority that's not what it is

1365
01:43:12,410 --> 01:43:18,680
It's it's an array of hierarchies of Authority so you imagine this sort of infinite plane and the the infinite plane

1366
01:43:19,010 --> 01:43:23,030
There's nothing but pyramids and inside the pyramids there are strata of people

1367
01:43:23,400 --> 01:43:28,310
Everywhere far as you can look some of the pyramids are tall some of them are short they overlap

1368
01:43:28,470 --> 01:43:33,949
it's endless the [plain] is endless and those are all the positions to which you could rise and

1369
01:43:34,350 --> 01:43:41,539
everybody's inside the pyramid sort of crammed up trying to move towards the top and then there's the possibility of sailing across over top of

1370
01:43:41,540 --> 01:43:44,689
all [of] them and seeing how the structure itself works

1371
01:43:44,690 --> 01:43:47,390
and that's and that's the eye that floats above the

1372
01:43:47,550 --> 01:43:48,600
pyramid and it sees the

1373
01:43:48,600 --> 01:43:54,589
structure itself and the highest order of being is [not] to be at the top of the pyramid it's to use the

1374
01:43:54,660 --> 01:44:02,389
discipline that you attain by striving towards the top of the pyramid to release yourself from the pyramid and move one step up and

1375
01:44:02,550 --> 01:44:07,639
That's I [think] that's one of the things that's instantiated in the idea of the for example of the holy ghost

1376
01:44:08,160 --> 01:44:10,160
so

1377
01:44:11,280 --> 01:44:17,059
And I think that's akin to that that's sisyphus and needs a set of sisyphus if I remember correctly that one has to

1378
01:44:17,370 --> 01:44:19,370
[Imagine] him happy well

1379
01:44:19,500 --> 01:44:21,480
If there's a rock at the bottom of the Hill

1380
01:44:21,480 --> 01:44:24,560
Then you might as well push it up the hill and if it rolls back [down] well

1381
01:44:24,560 --> 01:44:29,030
then you've got something else to do don't you can push the damn rock back up the hill and there's no shortage of

1382
01:44:29,280 --> 01:44:33,079
Rocks to put up to push up the hill and that's what we're built for anyways

1383
01:44:33,080 --> 01:44:38,479
And so let's go out and like push some damn boulders up the hill and then maybe we could have enough self-confidence

1384
01:44:38,790 --> 01:44:42,410
And enough enough respect for ourselves that we wouldn't have to turn to

1385
01:44:42,570 --> 01:44:46,459
Hatred and revenge and try to take everything down because I think that's the alternative

1386
01:44:47,100 --> 01:44:48,360
so

1387
01:44:48,360 --> 01:44:51,080
He's not weak. That's one thing you can say about him

1388
01:44:53,640 --> 01:44:58,280
The same idea represented there right that's outlets who voluntarily takes the world on his shoulders

1389
01:44:58,380 --> 01:45:01,880
It's like the idea of christ taking the sins of the world on his shoulders

1390
01:45:02,040 --> 01:45:08,450
[it's] exactly the same notion which is the notion that you should be able to recognize in yourself all the horror of

1391
01:45:08,730 --> 01:45:15,530
Humanity and take responsibility [for] it because that's what that means and the thing that's so interesting about that is that if you can recognize

1392
01:45:15,720 --> 01:45:20,479
Yourself in yourself all the horror of humanity [you] [will] instantly have a hell of a lot more

1393
01:45:20,550 --> 01:45:25,639
Respect for yourself than you did before you did that because there's some real utility and knowing that you're a monster

1394
01:45:26,220 --> 01:45:32,300
Now on just because you're a monster doesn't mean you have to be a monster, [but] it's really useful to [know] that you are one

1395
01:45:32,820 --> 01:45:34,999
so then and one of the things that Jung

1396
01:45:35,190 --> 01:45:42,109
Knew and this is something that I find so [amazing] about his writing [is] I think something that really distinguishes him for example from Joseph

1397
01:45:42,110 --> 01:45:44,299
Campbell who talked about following your bliss is like

1398
01:45:44,370 --> 01:45:51,320
Jung said very clearly that the first step to enlightenment is the encounter with the shadow and what he meant by that was

1399
01:45:51,840 --> 01:45:56,360
Everything horrible that human beings have done was [done] by human beings

1400
01:45:56,360 --> 01:45:58,549
and you're one of them [and]

1401
01:45:58,890 --> 01:46:02,809
So if you don't understand that and to understand that really means to know

1402
01:46:02,910 --> 01:46:09,829
how it was that you could have done it and that's a shattering thing to try to imagine that to try to imagine yourself as

1403
01:46:09,990 --> 01:46:14,840
Someone who's engaged in medieval torture to see how you could in fact do that

1404
01:46:14,840 --> 01:46:20,029
You're never the same after you learn that but being never the same after learning that is

1405
01:46:20,280 --> 01:46:25,400
Unbelievably useful because when you understand that that's what you're like, then you're a whole different creature

1406
01:46:25,400 --> 01:46:27,110
And I don't think and this is something

1407
01:46:27,110 --> 01:46:31,339
I did learn from jung is that you cannot be a good person until you know

1408
01:46:31,770 --> 01:46:37,550
How much evil you contain within you it is not possible, and it's partly because you just don't have any potency

1409
01:46:38,130 --> 01:46:43,609
like if you're just naive if you're just nice if you'd never hurt anyone you'd never hurt a fly you don't have the

1410
01:46:43,740 --> 01:46:47,179
Capability [for] any of that, why would anyone ever take you seriously?

1411
01:46:47,700 --> 01:46:50,420
You're you're just you're a domestic animal at best

1412
01:46:50,430 --> 01:46:52,639
You know and a rather contemptible one at that?

1413
01:46:52,640 --> 01:46:58,430
and it's a very strange thing because you wouldn't think that the revelation of the capacity for evil is a

1414
01:46:58,740 --> 01:47:00,920
precondition [for] the realization of good

1415
01:47:00,920 --> 01:47:06,109
But I believe first of all why [would] you be serious enough to even attempt [to] pursue the good?

1416
01:47:06,180 --> 01:47:10,280
Unless you had some sense of what the consequence was of not doing it

1417
01:47:10,950 --> 01:47:16,789
You have to be serious about these sorts of things. It's not it's not it's not the game of a child, right

1418
01:47:16,790 --> 01:47:22,040
It's the game of [a] fully developed adult and you have learned this in part when I had little kids

1419
01:47:22,040 --> 01:47:27,470
I wrote a chapter from my new book called never let your children do anything that makes you dislike them and

1420
01:47:27,930 --> 01:47:32,300
Why was that and I read I read that wrote that after [I] knew I was a monster

1421
01:47:32,300 --> 01:47:35,659
And I thought I'm going to make sure I [liked] my kids

1422
01:47:36,360 --> 01:47:41,389
I'm going to make sure they behave around me so that I like them because I'm way bigger than them

1423
01:47:41,390 --> 01:47:48,829
and I'm way more cruel than they are and I've got tricks up my sleeve that they cannot even possibly imagine [and] if if they

1424
01:47:49,470 --> 01:47:51,240
Irritate me. [I]

1425
01:47:51,240 --> 01:47:52,290
will absolutely

1426
01:47:52,290 --> 01:47:57,080
Take it out on them, and if you don't think that you're the sort of person that would do that

1427
01:47:57,080 --> 01:48:00,410
Then you are the sort of person [who] is doing it?

1428
01:48:14,720 --> 01:48:16,040
you know

1429
01:48:16,040 --> 01:48:18,040
We're not going to get to Adam and Eve ha ha

1430
01:48:19,040 --> 01:48:21,860
Aria I watched this great documentary once

1431
01:48:22,410 --> 01:48:28,880
Called Hitman hart and was about Bret hart and who was the most famous Canadian in the world for a while and he?

1432
01:48:29,040 --> 01:48:33,830
was a worldwide wrestling federation wrestler you know and he was a good guy and

1433
01:48:34,680 --> 01:48:38,360
He came from this famous family of wrestlers who all came from Alberta?

1434
01:48:38,360 --> 01:48:43,880
I think there were seven brothers who were wrestlers and seven sisters and all the sisters married wrestlers, and they were all

1435
01:48:44,940 --> 01:48:46,940
offspring children of Stu hart who

1436
01:48:47,490 --> 01:48:50,630
Was a wrestling impresario like 40 years ago

1437
01:48:50,630 --> 01:48:57,529
and it was it was such a cool documentary because I was always wondering why in the world did people watch wrestling and

1438
01:48:58,260 --> 01:49:04,219
And then believe it you know believe it. Do you believe movies when you go watch them? It's like

1439
01:49:04,950 --> 01:49:10,010
That's a hard question to answer while you're there you do and so if you're watching wrestling, and you're a wrestling fan

1440
01:49:10,010 --> 01:49:12,559
Do you believe it? Well it is a matter of belief?

1441
01:49:12,560 --> 01:49:18,950
It's a matter of being engaged in a drama and there are different levels of drama right so let's say worldwide wrestling

1442
01:49:19,320 --> 01:49:23,869
Federation drama is not the most sophisticated form of drama, okay?

1443
01:49:23,870 --> 01:49:27,650
But I'm not being a not being a smart aleck when I'm saying that

1444
01:49:28,080 --> 01:49:34,370
There is drama of different sophistication for different people, and that's also why religious truths exist at multiple levels simultaneously

1445
01:49:34,680 --> 01:49:39,019
Right it is got to [be] something in it for everyone, and that's a hard belief system

1446
01:49:39,020 --> 01:49:41,360
that's a hard system to put together something for the

1447
01:49:42,090 --> 01:49:45,799
Unbelievably sophisticated and something for the common person okay?

1448
01:49:45,800 --> 01:49:50,389
So we have wrestling and bret hart was a good guy, and he fell into the archetype of being a good guy

1449
01:49:50,390 --> 01:49:54,890
And that's partly what [the] what the story's about. It was a bit too much for him, but um

1450
01:49:55,500 --> 01:49:57,500
One of the things that he he laid out

1451
01:49:57,500 --> 01:50:03,589
So carefully where because he figured that 120 million people knew him something like that and that everywhere he went

1452
01:50:03,590 --> 01:50:08,960
he was treated like a hero and he found out quite a bit of quite a burden as you could imagine if you think about

1453
01:50:08,960 --> 01:50:11,930
It but he portrayed. What was happening in the wrestling ring as

1454
01:50:12,660 --> 01:50:14,660
classic good against evil but not

1455
01:50:15,390 --> 01:50:19,640
Conceptualized and discussed right embodied thought out acted out

1456
01:50:19,640 --> 01:50:25,010
You know like like the like thor and the hulk except like right in front of you and so

1457
01:50:26,100 --> 01:50:27,510
well

1458
01:50:27,510 --> 01:50:33,229
That's exactly this sort of thing. I mean we could consider hockey more sophisticated than wrestling perhaps and

1459
01:50:33,780 --> 01:50:36,919
As I said I'm not being a critic of these, I'm not being

1460
01:50:37,440 --> 01:50:43,040
Critically minded about these things I understand their purpose, and I would highly recommend that documentary it's a brilliant documentary

1461
01:50:43,500 --> 01:50:49,010
But this is it's the same thing. It's a silver cup right. It's like there's the hero of the team

1462
01:50:49,010 --> 01:50:52,579
That's the hero of the team's you know here's something cool

1463
01:50:53,490 --> 01:50:55,609
if you're the fan of the

1464
01:50:56,070 --> 01:50:56,700
Toronto

1465
01:50:56,700 --> 01:51:02,269
blue Jays are the Toronto maple leafs of course this hardly ever happens to you if you're the fan of the Toronto maple leafs because

1466
01:51:02,270 --> 01:51:05,870
they always lose, but haha but but if

1467
01:51:06,510 --> 01:51:10,729
You're watching a game and your team wins and we take your testosterone

1468
01:51:10,980 --> 01:51:12,560
Levels then they went up

1469
01:51:12,560 --> 01:51:18,979
And if you watch the Toronto maple leafs and they lost, and you're a fan then your testosterone levels go down

1470
01:51:19,110 --> 01:51:25,549
So that's pretty damn funny. You know. I mean really don't you see how deeply instantiated. This is in people

1471
01:51:25,550 --> 01:51:31,850
I mean it bloody well alters your biochemistry like your your your testosterone levels. It's all more my team loss

1472
01:51:32,130 --> 01:51:37,100
You know it's like ah do. We know there'll be nothing in it for the wife tonight. You know

1473
01:51:42,580 --> 01:51:44,580
Yeah

1474
01:51:54,880 --> 01:52:01,830
Well, this is the cosmos I think from from the phenomenological perspective and one of the things that that that has come

1475
01:52:02,889 --> 01:52:06,179
To my realization is that this is real?

1476
01:52:07,030 --> 01:52:09,090
This is real. It's not a metaphor

1477
01:52:09,159 --> 01:52:16,979
[it's] [way] deeper than a metaphor the most real things about life are the place you don't know and the place you know and

1478
01:52:17,320 --> 01:52:24,330
You could say well that's explored territory and unexplored territory that's real and it's been around forever back to the lobsters

1479
01:52:24,330 --> 01:52:26,369
You know if you put lobsters in their new place the first thing

1480
01:52:26,369 --> 01:52:31,739
They do is go around their territory finding places to hide and also making a burrow so the first thing

1481
01:52:31,739 --> 01:52:33,739
They do is establish what they know?

1482
01:52:34,900 --> 01:52:38,879
Against what they don't know and [that's] real it's real from the Darwinian perspective

1483
01:52:39,010 --> 01:52:45,360
And we're going to say that what's real from the Darwinian perspective is plenty real enough because we're alive [and] everything and so that sort

1484
01:52:45,360 --> 01:52:51,150
Of thing matters like well, that's what this is the taoist symbol. That's what it says. Is that what way it says?

1485
01:52:51,150 --> 01:52:53,150
What is experience made of?

1486
01:52:53,860 --> 01:52:55,860
Eternally that's easy

1487
01:52:56,320 --> 01:52:58,239
Chaos and order and

1488
01:52:58,239 --> 01:53:01,979
In every bit of Chaos. There's the possibility of order and in every bit of order

1489
01:53:01,980 --> 01:53:06,029
There's the possibility of Chaos, and that's the way right. That's the path of life

1490
01:53:06,130 --> 01:53:10,949
That's life itself and where you're supposed to be is right on the border between the two of those and why is that?

1491
01:53:11,619 --> 01:53:13,210
stable enough

1492
01:53:13,210 --> 01:53:15,030
Engaged enough, right?

1493
01:53:15,030 --> 01:53:20,849
So not only are you doing what you should be doing you're doing [in] a way that increases the probability that you'll do it better

1494
01:53:20,849 --> 01:53:23,369
tomorrow and you can tell when you're doing that because

1495
01:53:24,340 --> 01:53:31,830
You're engaged you're in the right time and place and your your neurology tells you that that's what

1496
01:53:32,139 --> 01:53:38,069
meaning is that's what transcendent meaning is and that's so cool because I also think [that] that is the antidote to

1497
01:53:38,830 --> 01:53:45,239
Existential suffering the antidote to existential suffering is to be at the right place at the right time and you know?

1498
01:53:45,610 --> 01:53:48,719
You want to get technical about it okay anxiety and pain?

1499
01:53:49,150 --> 01:53:53,670
That's the cause that's the reality of the existential [so] suffering okay

1500
01:53:53,670 --> 01:53:57,690
So let's say you're in the right place at the right time what happens to you, biochemically?

1501
01:53:58,270 --> 01:54:00,720
Dopaminergic activation, what does that do?

1502
01:54:01,480 --> 01:54:04,739
Suppresses anxiety and it's analgesic now

1503
01:54:04,739 --> 01:54:10,589
it's more than that because also produces positive emotion and the desire [to] move forward and it underlies creativity and

1504
01:54:11,020 --> 01:54:14,669
And so so not only do you get the positive engagement from a neurochemical?

1505
01:54:15,040 --> 01:54:22,680
Perspective you get the analgesia and you get the anti end and you get the reduction of [anxiety] so it's not hypothetical

1506
01:54:22,680 --> 01:54:29,039
It's and it is the case that the dopaminergic systems those are the exploratory systems unbelievably ancient and archaic are

1507
01:54:29,620 --> 01:54:32,399
activated when you're optimally positioned to be

1508
01:54:32,920 --> 01:54:34,920
To be what?

1509
01:54:35,410 --> 01:54:41,579
Incorporating new information, which is what human beings do because we're information foragers, and so we want to be secure

1510
01:54:41,580 --> 01:54:46,499
But building on [our] security at the same time and then we want to do it for ourselves

1511
01:54:46,570 --> 01:54:49,350
We want to do it for other people we want to do it for our families

1512
01:54:49,350 --> 01:54:51,989
We want to do it for broader Society we want to bring the whole world

1513
01:54:52,150 --> 01:54:55,560
Together in alignment to do that, and that's meaningful

1514
01:54:55,560 --> 01:55:00,660
And God only knows what we could do about the suffering of the world if we did that you know we have no idea

1515
01:55:01,120 --> 01:55:06,989
What we could do if [we] started doing things properly and maybe so many of the things that dismay us about life

1516
01:55:06,989 --> 01:55:08,100
We could we could stop

1517
01:55:08,100 --> 01:55:09,030
I mean

1518
01:55:09,030 --> 01:55:13,890
We stopped a lot of them in the last hundred years you [know] things are a lot better than they were a hundred years ago

1519
01:55:14,470 --> 01:55:16,799
Obviously, they're not perfect, but [a] hundred years ago

1520
01:55:17,800 --> 01:55:23,820
120 years ago man, you know the average person in the western world lived on less than a dollar a day in today's dollars

1521
01:55:23,890 --> 01:55:26,819
It's like you just try that for a week and see how much fun that is

1522
01:55:27,370 --> 01:55:29,370
so the daoists

1523
01:55:30,190 --> 01:55:31,530
Well, what is this well?

1524
01:55:31,530 --> 01:55:37,530
This is the pre cosmogonic Chaos out of which the [word] of [God] extracted habitable order at the beginning of time

1525
01:55:37,720 --> 01:55:41,189
It's the same thing. It's the [same] thing and [that] Chaos

1526
01:55:41,980 --> 01:55:43,620
We'll talk a bit more about [that] later

1527
01:55:43,620 --> 01:55:48,930
I guess because it's a very complicated thing to to describe, but it's certainly the thing that when you encounter

1528
01:55:49,690 --> 01:55:52,560
The Chaos is what you encounter when the twin towers fall?

1529
01:55:53,800 --> 01:55:56,370
right you remember what that was [like] right, so

1530
01:55:56,980 --> 01:56:03,629
It was it was september 10th. Well that was the world everyone knew what the world was like and then it was september 11th

1531
01:56:03,630 --> 01:56:07,379
and everyone walked around day for three days because

1532
01:56:07,899 --> 01:56:09,899
the [Building's] [failed]

1533
01:56:10,359 --> 01:56:16,499
But so what you can see a building fall, you can understand what it's what happens when a building falls

1534
01:56:16,499 --> 01:56:18,989
So then what's going on with the being dazed well?

1535
01:56:18,989 --> 01:56:25,708
it's the Chaos that underlies our habitable order manifested itself in those buildings [collapse] was a Brilliant act of Terrorism and

1536
01:56:25,869 --> 01:56:32,578
Everyone was frozen and curious because that's how we react to that sort of thing the it's like

1537
01:56:32,579 --> 01:56:34,579
It's like the shark. You know remember that famous

1538
01:56:35,050 --> 01:56:40,050
That famous movie poster for jaws with the woman swimming on the top of the water and that terrible

1539
01:56:40,959 --> 01:56:45,569
Leviathan shark underneath coming up to to take her out. Well that's life man

1540
01:56:45,570 --> 01:56:51,119
That's the world and now and then you see [that] [and] when something falls like the twin towers fall you

1541
01:56:51,369 --> 01:56:56,878
remember that the Ocean below you the abyss right the primordial abyss that bloody thing is deep and

1542
01:56:57,099 --> 01:57:01,498
Then you're fragile, and that happens when [someone] betrays you and it's happened

1543
01:57:01,499 --> 01:57:06,749
It happens to you when your dreams fall apart you encounter that Chaos again from which the world is extracted

1544
01:57:06,749 --> 01:57:08,999
And then you're called upon to act out

1545
01:57:10,059 --> 01:57:13,858
attention and the word in order to bring the world back into order and none of that is

1546
01:57:14,769 --> 01:57:16,769
none of that is

1547
01:57:17,260 --> 01:57:21,749
Superstitious none of that is superstitious none of that's even metaphorical. It's real

1548
01:57:22,329 --> 01:57:26,699
Its ribs more real than anything else, and I [think] the reason for that in part is that

1549
01:57:27,309 --> 01:57:29,518
This has been it's been this way forever

1550
01:57:30,820 --> 01:57:32,820
Right as long as there's been life

1551
01:57:33,189 --> 01:57:35,699
this has been the rule of life and

1552
01:57:36,429 --> 01:57:39,929
That's the cosmos that's reality. That's what we inhabit

1553
01:57:39,929 --> 01:57:44,429
And so one of the things you know the the so-called new atheists

1554
01:57:44,429 --> 01:57:50,429
And I they don't want to go on a tangent about new atheists because I think atheists are often remarkably honest and very

1555
01:57:50,649 --> 01:57:52,679
consistent in their analysis, so

1556
01:57:55,059 --> 01:57:59,759
But I just don't think they're taking the problem seriously that like I don't think they take their evolutionary

1557
01:58:00,280 --> 01:58:02,199
theorizing nearly

1558
01:58:02,199 --> 01:58:07,678
With the seriousness that it that it necessitates, and I don't think that I

1559
01:58:11,019 --> 01:58:17,789
Don't think that you can dispute the proposition that the longer something has had a selection effect

1560
01:58:19,000 --> 01:58:22,770
Life the more real it [is] it's the fundamental

1561
01:58:23,260 --> 01:58:25,349
axiom of Darwinian biology

1562
01:58:25,350 --> 01:58:31,590
And I think the Darwinian world is more real than the [physical] world that was the argument that I was trying to have with

1563
01:58:31,810 --> 01:58:37,710
with Sam Harris, and I didn't do the world's best job with that although it went not too bad the second time, but it's

1564
01:58:38,740 --> 01:58:41,670
It's not something to be taken lightly. [it's] a very

1565
01:58:42,520 --> 01:58:44,520
serious Profound and meaningful

1566
01:58:45,190 --> 01:58:46,630
proposition and

1567
01:58:46,630 --> 01:58:49,380
People [act] [it] out and want to act it out whether they know it or not

1568
01:58:51,190 --> 01:58:53,190
That's Marduk

1569
01:58:54,100 --> 01:58:57,300
So the story of Marduk, I'll just give it to you very briefly

1570
01:58:59,230 --> 01:59:05,069
Time at an apse who are locked in embrace at the beginning of time goddess of [saltwater]. God of freshwater?

1571
01:59:05,590 --> 01:59:09,090
Together Chaos an order right they give rise

1572
01:59:09,670 --> 01:59:14,099
Masculine feminine they give rise [to] the world of the elder gods and those are to me their primordial

1573
01:59:14,380 --> 01:59:16,409
motivational forces or something like [that] and

1574
01:59:17,560 --> 01:59:22,050
Their rage and their lust and their love and all these things that possess us that are there forever

1575
01:59:22,050 --> 01:59:27,960
and they're out in the world acting and they carelessly slay absolu their father and

1576
01:59:28,540 --> 01:59:30,540
they're making a racket and then they

1577
01:59:30,820 --> 01:59:32,820
Collapse ooh and then time at

1578
01:59:33,160 --> 01:59:38,610
gives wind of [that], and that's a [timeout] right there by the way she's kind of a rough looking creature and

1579
01:59:39,220 --> 01:59:45,179
She's a mother of all things and so she's not very happy about this. They said though these her children have destroyed

1580
01:59:45,850 --> 01:59:47,790
structure itself Plus

1581
01:59:47,790 --> 01:59:50,910
They're noisy and Careless and so she thinks all right, just like Noah

1582
01:59:51,040 --> 01:59:56,310
Just like the God that brings the flood to know what exactly the same idea time ad comes back

1583
01:59:56,310 --> 02:00:01,050
It says yeah, okay enough is enough. I'm going to take you out and she makes this

1584
02:00:01,870 --> 02:00:07,620
Battalion of monsters and puts the worst monster there is at the head of the Battalion. His name is King

1585
02:00:07,620 --> 02:00:12,570
He's like a precursor to the idea of Satan and she lets the gods know hey

1586
02:00:13,180 --> 02:00:18,180
I'm coming for you, and so they're not very happy about this because their gods, but like yeah

1587
02:00:18,730 --> 02:00:23,879
She's Chaos itself right she gave birth to everything. This is no joke and so they send one

1588
02:00:23,880 --> 02:00:28,049
God out after another to confront her and they all come [back] with the tails between their legs

1589
02:00:28,450 --> 02:00:30,330
There's no hope and then one day

1590
02:00:30,330 --> 02:00:35,979
There's a new God that emerges in that marduk and the gods know as soon as he pops up they know he's something new

1591
02:00:36,440 --> 02:00:42,100
Remember and this is happening [while] the mesopotamians are assembling themselves into one of the world's first great

1592
02:00:42,469 --> 02:00:48,879
Civilizations so all the gods of all those tribes are coming together to [organize] themselves into a hierarchy to figure out

1593
02:00:48,880 --> 02:00:55,869
What proposition rules everything and so marduk is elected by all the gods and he says look I'll go out there

1594
02:00:55,869 --> 02:01:01,389
And I'll take on time at but here's the rule from here on you follow me. I determine destiny

1595
02:01:01,389 --> 02:01:08,049
I'm the top God I'm the [thing] at the top of the hierarchy and all the other gods say hey look no problem you get

1596
02:01:08,050 --> 02:01:09,800
rid of Chaos

1597
02:01:09,800 --> 02:01:15,190
We do exactly what you say now marduk. [he] [has] eyes all the way around his head and he speaks Magic words

1598
02:01:15,340 --> 02:01:16,690
Those are his primary attributes

1599
02:01:16,690 --> 02:01:22,600
and so he takes a net and he goes out to confront time out and and he he

1600
02:01:22,940 --> 02:01:24,909
He encloses her in a net which

1601
02:01:24,909 --> 02:01:32,499
I think is so cool because it's an encapsulation right? It's a conceptual encapsulation. He encloses Chaos itself in a conceptual structure

1602
02:01:32,500 --> 02:01:37,239
he puts it in the net and then he cuts her into pieces and he makes the world and

1603
02:01:38,000 --> 02:01:40,000
then

1604
02:01:42,469 --> 02:01:45,669
Then he creates human beings to inhabit [that] world and to serve the gods

1605
02:01:45,670 --> 02:01:50,529
and he creates human beings out of the blood of king of the worst of the demons and

1606
02:01:50,840 --> 02:01:56,469
That took me to call into young as the student might help me figure that out. I thought that's pretty damn pessimistic

1607
02:01:56,469 --> 02:02:03,069
It's like you know what exactly it sounds like a fall metaphor. It's like the idea of original sin, but but our

1608
02:02:04,100 --> 02:02:06,100
joint Conclusion

1609
02:02:06,409 --> 02:02:13,359
With regards to that with it human beings are the only creatures in creation that can truly deceive

1610
02:02:14,090 --> 02:02:17,380
Right we have the capacity for evil. Just like it says in the Adam and Eve story

1611
02:02:17,380 --> 02:02:18,610
We can actually do that

1612
02:02:18,610 --> 02:02:21,940
and that's why we're made out of the blood of king of the king of the demons the

1613
02:02:22,159 --> 02:02:26,319
We are the thing that can deceive that can twist the structure of reality?

1614
02:02:26,929 --> 02:02:33,339
well, so marduk now the mesopotamians had an emperor right and the emperor was the

1615
02:02:35,090 --> 02:02:38,319
Avatar of Marduk that's what made him emperor. He was only at emperor

1616
02:02:38,320 --> 02:02:43,750
if he was going to be marduk he had to be a good marduk which Mantia do confront time at Chaos and

1617
02:02:44,030 --> 02:02:49,000
Cut her off and make or out of her pieces and what the method name is used to do at the New Year's celebration

1618
02:02:49,340 --> 02:02:54,489
They go outside the walled city, and that's explored territory versus unexplored territory

1619
02:02:54,489 --> 02:02:59,109
They go outside their walled city into [Chaos] and they bring all the statues that represented the gods

1620
02:02:59,110 --> 02:03:04,210
And they'd act this out because they're trying to figure something out right you're trying to figure [out] what this means

1621
02:03:04,210 --> 02:03:09,759
They're acting it out, and then they take their emperor and the priest would make them kneel, and [they'd] take all his king

1622
02:03:10,670 --> 02:03:14,140
equally all his king uniform off his emperor uniform off and

1623
02:03:14,480 --> 02:03:18,189
Make him kneel and humiliate him and nail him with a glove and say okay

1624
02:03:18,739 --> 02:03:25,029
How were you not a good [marduk] this year right? And then he'd recount all the ways that he was inadequate in

1625
02:03:25,580 --> 02:03:32,289
confronting Chaos, and then they do the celebration and marduk would win and and the king would go sleep with a royal prostitute and and

1626
02:03:32,900 --> 02:03:37,299
The reason for that was it's the same [idea] st.. George pulling the virgin from the dragon

1627
02:03:37,300 --> 02:03:40,690
it's exactly the same idea that if you call if you encounter the

1628
02:03:41,210 --> 02:03:47,469
Reptilian Chaos you can extract something out of it with which if you unite, you produce creative order

1629
02:03:47,469 --> 02:03:54,129
That's what they were acting out, and that was the basis for the mesopotamian idea of sovereignty. It's so smart

1630
02:03:54,130 --> 02:03:59,080
it's so unbelievably smart and you know the mesopotamians had a massive influence on the

1631
02:03:59,330 --> 02:04:06,189
civilizations that then had a massive influence on assets one of the stories of how the notion of sovereignty itself came to be it's the

1632
02:04:06,190 --> 02:04:09,700
Evolution of the idea of God that's one way of thinking about it

1633
02:04:09,700 --> 02:04:15,339
But even more importantly it's the evolution of the idea of the redemptive human being right?

1634
02:04:15,340 --> 02:04:19,299
And that's taken - it's one of its conclusions following the story of buddha

1635
02:04:19,300 --> 02:04:23,770
But also in the story of christ the idea of the perfect individual and the notion is well

1636
02:04:23,770 --> 02:04:29,770
That's the word that speaks truth into Chaos at the beginning of time to generate habitable order that is good

1637
02:04:30,200 --> 02:04:32,950
That's the story and so with that

1638
02:04:38,130 --> 02:04:39,690
Let's See oh

1639
02:04:39,690 --> 02:04:46,040
Sure, I'll just show you these [pictures] because they're so interesting once you know what they mean, they're so cool. That's a symbol of infinity

1640
02:04:46,739 --> 02:04:51,799
[let's] Hercules and Hydra. What's life like cut off one head what happens?

1641
02:04:52,410 --> 02:04:57,589
Seven more grow right, what do you do run hold well? No, that's not what you do it

1642
02:04:57,590 --> 02:04:59,810
This is what you do you fight it

1643
02:05:00,750 --> 02:05:03,109
It's the it's the Chaos that generates

1644
02:05:05,040 --> 02:05:08,390
Partial Chaos, it's the ultimate Chaos that generates partial Chaos

1645
02:05:08,390 --> 02:05:12,169
But that Chaos also is what Revista finds life because otherwise it would just be static

1646
02:05:17,790 --> 02:05:19,590
Mercury

1647
02:05:19,590 --> 02:05:26,509
The head of the Hydra right freeze of you, I'd [saint] George. He's doing it peacefully which is so interesting right?

1648
02:05:26,510 --> 02:05:32,630
He's got a beatific look on his face in that particular representation another [Saint] George right the virgin in the background

1649
02:05:32,630 --> 02:05:34,630
I think that's say dan if I remember correctly

1650
02:05:39,300 --> 02:05:41,300
St.. George is the Patron Saint of England

1651
02:05:43,320 --> 02:05:48,739
Here's an interesting one this actually sheds light on on the human proclivity for Warfare St.. George

1652
02:05:48,980 --> 02:05:50,980
That's a Muslim soldier

1653
02:05:51,000 --> 02:05:57,830
It's really easy to transform the enemy into the dragon right because the enemy is often the predator and we do that instantaneously

1654
02:05:57,830 --> 02:06:03,379
Right without a second thought and so then we can go to war morally because why not take out the snakes?

1655
02:06:03,929 --> 02:06:11,119
well, you know the problem is where are the snakes or maybe they're outside and maybe they're not maybe they're in this room and even

1656
02:06:11,120 --> 02:06:14,989
Worse maybe they're in you and that's wisdom when you know that they're  in you.

1657
02:06:19,290 --> 02:06:25,399
Why wouldn't she be happy about that especially [if] she had a especially if she had a child right seriously?

1658
02:06:32,700 --> 02:06:36,529
and that's [horace] right the god of vision and he was a

1659
02:06:38,460 --> 02:06:45,529
He was a falken because Falcons have great vision and they fly above everything and they can see everything so that was the egyptian created

1660
02:06:45,530 --> 02:06:48,440
God horus, and I'll tell you the story about horus at some points well

1661
02:06:52,170 --> 02:06:54,890
Now here are some pictures that demonstrate what I had

1662
02:06:55,650 --> 02:06:59,240
Described as the emergence of let's say the meta hero out of the hero

1663
02:06:59,250 --> 02:07:03,200
So there's the person you [admire], and then there's the set of people that you admire

1664
02:07:03,200 --> 02:07:10,249
[and] then there's the meta set of admirable people and the extraction of that ideal as far as I can tell that's just what's portrayed

1665
02:07:10,470 --> 02:07:12,470
in these images

1666
02:07:20,550 --> 02:07:25,970
That's a great one. It's very sophisticated image you see that the two sides of Christ's face are not

1667
02:07:27,900 --> 02:07:29,220
symmetrical

1668
02:07:29,220 --> 02:07:36,319
One is God in ones man. That's what that icon means and so the fully developed person in this representation. [it's] one of the oldest

1669
02:07:36,900 --> 02:07:40,220
representations of this sort that we know the idea is that

1670
02:07:41,370 --> 02:07:43,370
There's a there's a human person

1671
02:07:43,950 --> 02:07:51,679
In his ordinariness let's say, and then there's this this kinship with the divine that's associated with the willing

1672
02:07:52,320 --> 02:07:57,650
adoption of the responsibilities of Moral Mortal being and that produces this union

1673
02:07:57,650 --> 02:08:04,700
And then it's manifest in a book right because that's speech, and it's associated with the son right it's the proper way of being

1674
02:08:09,690 --> 02:08:17,120
And that's a perfect example. I think of the emergence of the archetype out of the multitude. That's what it looks like to me

1675
02:08:26,880 --> 02:08:31,940
and so I guess now we're done with Genesis one and took three lectures, but

1676
02:08:32,760 --> 02:08:35,060
[God's] complicated you know, that's the thing

1677
02:08:35,910 --> 02:08:37,910
so

1678
02:08:47,650 --> 02:08:49,650
so thank you and

1679
02:08:50,470 --> 02:08:55,409
Next week by all appearances. That's where we are so we've got

1680
02:08:56,530 --> 02:08:58,530
20 minutes for questions

1681
02:08:58,570 --> 02:09:02,489
So in the past I've done some work with blog big brother big sister and whatever

1682
02:09:03,160 --> 02:09:09,030
[that] being said that the most common story I tend to hear from pacific youth is that they write they're raised in a single family

1683
02:09:09,030 --> 02:09:13,949
Home usually [with] a mom daddy's there on a picture in alcoholic, whatever whatever the writer

1684
02:09:14,170 --> 02:09:17,550
So we have this child who is trying to?

1685
02:09:18,610 --> 02:09:23,819
Seek ways to make himself healthy and Empower himself in a ways that a healthy father should have done

1686
02:09:23,820 --> 02:09:27,989
So you know between the formative years [of] like 1 to 4 so I think you know I'm going with this

1687
02:09:28,840 --> 02:09:34,380
How let's say for someone who born without like a good father figure where would they go out in the world or like what?

1688
02:09:34,570 --> 02:09:37,799
for series of incidents where they try to expose themselves to to like

1689
02:09:38,380 --> 02:09:40,380
gain access to that

1690
02:09:40,510 --> 02:09:42,460
balancing of health and

1691
02:09:42,460 --> 02:09:45,870
Knowledge that a father though a good father figure should have provided to in the first place

1692
02:09:46,230 --> 02:09:47,190
[ok] well partly

1693
02:09:47,190 --> 02:09:52,470
I mean certainly to some degree a good mother can provide that right to some degree although

1694
02:09:52,470 --> 02:09:57,780
it's hard for one person to be everything right you know and I think one of the conundrums that face women and this is [a]

1695
02:09:57,780 --> 02:10:02,189
Tough one and this is why I think women are higher in trade agreeableness and higher and trade negative emotion

1696
02:10:02,190 --> 02:10:04,290
Is that you know the primary?

1697
02:10:04,720 --> 02:10:09,869
Problem that a woman has with an infant is why not throw it out a window because it's very annoying right?

1698
02:10:09,870 --> 02:10:12,300
I mean, it's there all the [time]. It's constant demand

1699
02:10:12,300 --> 02:10:18,929
It's absolutely constant amount tremendous dependency and so a woman has to be tilted Towards Mercy

1700
02:10:19,060 --> 02:10:20,290
That's how it looks to me

1701
02:10:20,290 --> 02:10:26,100
Right and especially during it's so important during the especially the first year when children are so unbelievably vulnerable

1702
02:10:26,230 --> 02:10:32,880
And so I think it's very difficult for women to be merciful like that and to make the shift to encouraging

1703
02:10:33,460 --> 02:10:36,510
Disciplinarian I think that's a very difficult thing for people to do

1704
02:10:37,330 --> 02:10:38,590
simultaneously although

1705
02:10:38,590 --> 02:10:45,569
You know people people. I'm not saying that women are always only merciful and men are always only encouraging disciplinarians

1706
02:10:45,570 --> 02:10:50,489
But things do sort themselves out to some degree [like] that, and I think also the biochemical transformations

1707
02:10:51,130 --> 02:10:56,639
That accompany pregnancy and childbirth and lactation also tilt a mother towards that as well

1708
02:10:56,680 --> 02:11:00,450
We have to really love that little thing right it's it's number one

1709
02:11:00,450 --> 02:11:05,039
No matter what it demands, and then telling it what to do and making sure it's behaving properly

1710
02:11:05,040 --> 02:11:09,930
That's that's a whole [different] issue now, but the kids who Lack fathers. I mean

1711
02:11:10,570 --> 02:11:13,110
first of all they can find that to some [degree] in their friends

1712
02:11:13,110 --> 02:11:19,799
And that's often what father boys do in particular they go into gangs and they generate the missing men

1713
02:11:20,050 --> 02:11:23,699
Masculinity in the game well that's not so good because like what the hell do they know

1714
02:11:24,460 --> 02:11:26,010
Well, they don't know anything, right?

1715
02:11:26,010 --> 02:11:27,000
They're just stupid kids

1716
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:31,830
And they're like [fifteen] years old and the testosterone is pumping and they're trying to get the hell [away] from their mother

1717
02:11:31,830 --> 02:11:38,010
Which is what they're supposed [to] do and and they're not in the right position [to] exercise any authority over themselves

1718
02:11:38,010 --> 02:11:43,079
So that's that's not good. They can find it in education. They can find it in books they can find it in movies

1719
02:11:43,080 --> 02:11:50,070
They can find it in sports heroes and so forth because the image of the father is fragmented and distributed among the community

1720
02:11:50,070 --> 02:11:51,700
But it's very very difficult

1721
02:11:51,700 --> 02:11:52,870
To not have a father

1722
02:11:52,870 --> 02:11:57,120
[right] and you know one [of] the things that we're doing in our society which I think is I think it's absolutely

1723
02:11:57,640 --> 02:12:04,079
Appalling is that we're making the case that all families are equal. It's like sorry no wrong

1724
02:12:04,780 --> 02:12:08,009
Then there's no empirical data supporting that proposition by the way

1725
02:12:08,010 --> 02:12:13,019
It's much better for kids to have two parents know who those parents are that's a whole different issue, okay?

1726
02:12:13,020 --> 02:12:13,660
and if I could just

1727
02:12:13,660 --> 02:12:19,349
[add] one [more] thing of how would you ask that question so let's see a daughter [was] raised not a father because [she] would all

1728
02:12:19,350 --> 02:12:25,440
See have different ways to find those fragments of her missing [father] than like a boy would instead because obviously they're raised differently at least

1729
02:12:25,440 --> 02:12:31,919
They should have been well. I think it's the same issue. You know. I mean. I think that another danger that emerges Mrs.

1730
02:12:31,920 --> 02:12:38,519
Freud's of course famous observation is that you know if there's mom and child were father and child that

1731
02:12:38,680 --> 02:12:41,159
relationship can get a little closer than it should and

1732
02:12:41,290 --> 02:12:45,810
Then the lines get blurry and mixed and I'm not saying that that happens to everyone

1733
02:12:46,090 --> 02:12:50,190
Obviously, but but it's still a danger that that's inherent in the situation

1734
02:12:50,190 --> 02:12:52,769
They're thrust together too tightly without

1735
02:12:53,140 --> 02:12:54,220
sufficient resources

1736
02:12:54,220 --> 02:13:00,449
and so the responsibility has to be distributed more and like I really do think that it's the sign of the degeneration of the

1737
02:13:00,550 --> 02:13:08,190
Society when that when when single parenthood becomes anything approximating the norm it's not a good idea

1738
02:13:08,620 --> 02:13:12,630
then the and part of the reason I believe that and I [think] this has to do with the

1739
02:13:13,980 --> 02:13:15,980
overwhelming selfishness of

1740
02:13:17,160 --> 02:13:19,970
Modern life is that marriage isn't for the people who are married

1741
02:13:20,640 --> 02:13:28,460
It's for the children [obviously] [and] like if you can't handle that grow the hell up see right now. I mean seriously yeah seriously

1742
02:13:30,150 --> 02:13:31,710
Thank you

1743
02:13:31,710 --> 02:13:35,779
Once you once you have kids it is not about you

1744
02:13:36,780 --> 02:13:40,909
period Now that doesn't mean it isn't about you at all but

1745
02:13:42,450 --> 02:13:48,230
That just seems so self-evident to me. I can't believe that anybody would even would even question it. Oh, it's [dino] larson

1746
02:13:48,230 --> 02:13:54,679
Oh, yes, well, I'm certainly aware of that yes. It's questioned. It's almost illegal to question it now you know [to] to or

1747
02:13:55,320 --> 02:13:58,610
illegal to make the set of propositions [that] I'm making so

1748
02:14:01,080 --> 02:14:03,290
That's the best. I can do guys excellent. Thank you

1749
02:14:09,750 --> 02:14:15,349
The question is going in part two the first part of first up here lecture, but it's also something that's been on my mind

1750
02:14:16,680 --> 02:14:19,880
Listening to your lectures over the past few months, and that's when we talk about

1751
02:14:20,550 --> 02:14:22,080
the

1752
02:14:22,080 --> 02:14:29,900
Psychological truth or significance of the Bible to what extent does that psychological psychological truth has to be embodied in specific?

1753
02:14:30,360 --> 02:14:36,409
Historical events or people and so for instance the thing that sort of been bugging on my mind

1754
02:14:37,020 --> 02:14:41,479
There's there's a part that st.. Paul is talking about in the new testament somewhere

1755
02:14:42,180 --> 02:14:47,300
In one of his letters, and he's talking to the resurrection, and he says if it didn't happen

1756
02:14:47,970 --> 02:14:52,970
Then if this whole thing just means the [faith] is meaningless like for him there had to be that

1757
02:14:53,520 --> 02:14:55,280
Embodiment of that his capital. Yes

1758
02:14:55,280 --> 02:14:56,580
The nor event in that case

1759
02:14:56,580 --> 02:15:02,420
Well the best answer I have to that at the moment is that I'm really happy that I'm not at that point yet in this

1760
02:15:02,420 --> 02:15:04,390
lecture series

1761
02:15:04,390 --> 02:15:11,999
you know because because that there's a there's a crucial issue there, and I don't know exactly what to make of it and

1762
02:15:13,180 --> 02:15:18,689
My approach at the moment as I said is to approach this as rationally as I possibly can and I hope I know a hell

1763
02:15:18,690 --> 02:15:23,970
of a lot more about what I'm doing by the time I get to that particular [question] [and]

1764
02:15:24,910 --> 02:15:26,740
I do have

1765
02:15:26,740 --> 02:15:33,899
The beginnings of ways to answer that but I'm not going to answer that at all right now because it's so bloody complicated that would

1766
02:15:33,900 --> 02:15:38,460
Just burn me to a frazzle and I'm already mostly bird to a frazzle after that lecture, so I

1767
02:15:39,100 --> 02:15:41,579
Couldn't attempt to even start to sketch it out

1768
02:15:41,580 --> 02:15:47,879
I don't know. [I] mean part of it is to be just rational about it just to be rational about it

1769
02:15:47,880 --> 02:15:53,850
There is something about the idea that continual death and rebirth is a necessary precondition to proper human adaptation

1770
02:15:54,730 --> 02:16:00,480
every time you learn something new that's important part of the stupid old you [has] to die and

1771
02:16:00,880 --> 02:16:05,880
Sometimes that can be an awful lot of you and in fact it can be so much of you sometimes that you just die

1772
02:16:06,100 --> 02:16:07,680
Right you just can't handle it

1773
02:16:07,680 --> 02:16:13,200
And so there is there is a real idea that you have to identify with the part of [yourself] that

1774
02:16:13,570 --> 02:16:17,159
Transcends [your] current personality that can constantly die and be reborn

1775
02:16:17,740 --> 02:16:24,959
Now then I could say well that means that all of this is psychological and symbolic, and that's the simplest answer

1776
02:16:25,990 --> 02:16:29,340
But I'm not satisfied with that answer even though

1777
02:16:29,340 --> 02:16:36,150
I think it's coherent and complete because the [world] [is] a very weird place and there are things about it that we don't understand so

1778
02:16:37,000 --> 02:16:40,709
so I can't go I can't go any farther than that at the moment, so

1779
02:16:41,650 --> 02:16:43,650
Yeah

1780
02:16:47,290 --> 02:16:50,639
Hi, Dr.. Peterson. I just recently watched

1781
02:16:51,190 --> 02:16:55,770
One of your videos of you debating with transgendered protesters at uoft

1782
02:16:56,590 --> 02:16:58,590
free speech Rally in October and

1783
02:16:59,320 --> 02:17:01,030
one of the

1784
02:17:01,030 --> 02:17:07,469
Protesters one of the comments one of the protesters said to you which [isn't] particularly very like very chilling was

1785
02:17:08,469 --> 02:17:13,769
Why do you have the right to determine whether an individual is worthy of you using their pronouns?

1786
02:17:14,740 --> 02:17:19,889
The scary thing to me is how common this type [of] view is among Radical Left-Wing?

1787
02:17:20,889 --> 02:17:24,358
[protesters] on University campuses who feel they have the right to tell other people

1788
02:17:24,729 --> 02:17:31,589
What they [can] think what words they can use and what speakers they can or cannot listen to?

1789
02:17:32,620 --> 02:17:37,410
The even scarier part is that our government is creating legislations to back up their ADl?

1790
02:17:38,019 --> 02:17:39,130
ideologies

1791
02:17:39,130 --> 02:17:41,759
which is evident through [Bill] C16

1792
02:17:42,670 --> 02:17:44,670
M103 and Bill 89

1793
02:17:45,490 --> 02:17:50,999
So my question is what do you think the [endgame] is in all this because it seems?

1794
02:17:51,460 --> 02:17:54,120
Every year or we're in the process of finding that out?

1795
02:17:54,880 --> 02:17:57,000
You know and I'm sorry. I'm sorry

1796
02:17:57,760 --> 02:18:00,000
Okay, we're in [the] [process] of finding that out

1797
02:18:00,550 --> 02:18:07,200
I don't I mean I think the endgame that underlies all of that in my estimation

1798
02:18:07,570 --> 02:18:09,809
Is best summed up by jacques?

1799
02:18:09,849 --> 02:18:16,319
Derrida's [Christiane] [her] criticism [of] western Civilization its Fal logo centric now

1800
02:18:16,320 --> 02:18:18,320
We've already talked about what the logos means

1801
02:18:18,580 --> 02:18:23,249
Right and so and and so for for Derrida that was a sign of its utter

1802
02:18:24,099 --> 02:18:30,268
What would you call it utter despit the dot early despicable dominant nature of Western Culture

1803
02:18:30,670 --> 02:18:35,849
Well that that's what animates the post modernists now. They may not know that because

1804
02:18:36,639 --> 02:18:38,639
an Indie ology gets fragmented

1805
02:18:39,280 --> 02:18:40,590
across its Adherents

1806
02:18:40,590 --> 02:18:47,219
And then it only acts as the coherent ideology with all those adherents come together in a mob and then you see the animating spirit

1807
02:18:48,099 --> 02:18:50,099
So I

1808
02:18:50,800 --> 02:18:55,920
Said I think that there's a battle going on. That's a battle exactly at the level that Derrida

1809
02:18:56,859 --> 02:19:00,629
Described and that's a theological battle with a philosophical

1810
02:19:02,649 --> 02:19:04,649
With it with the philosophical implications

1811
02:19:06,399 --> 02:19:13,529
And out of those philosophical implications come political implications, but it's not primarily political and it's not primarily philosophical

1812
02:19:13,530 --> 02:19:17,159
It's deeper than that and the post modernists are out

1813
02:19:17,500 --> 02:19:21,719
There their criticism was designed to be

1814
02:19:22,240 --> 02:19:28,709
Fundamental and it also emerged out of Marxism and let's not forget that the Marxist Criticism was not only fundamental

1815
02:19:28,710 --> 02:19:35,199
But just about resulted in the nuclear annihilation of the [girl] these are not trivial issues, and we're back in the same

1816
02:19:36,439 --> 02:19:41,108
Insane boat and so what do I think should be done about that well?

1817
02:19:41,109 --> 02:19:45,488
I thought about that way before any of this happened, and I think that what?

1818
02:19:46,429 --> 02:19:48,938
We [should] do about it is we [should] tell the truth

1819
02:19:50,090 --> 02:19:52,179
Because there isn't anything more powerful than that

1820
02:19:52,180 --> 02:19:58,659
And that's the right theological answer because the spoken truth brings good into being

1821
02:19:59,270 --> 02:20:02,050
Well, that's the [Fal] logo centric idea

1822
02:20:02,050 --> 02:20:09,550
And I'm trying to revisit that to explain to people what it means and to see if they think that's a good idea. [I] mean

1823
02:20:11,239 --> 02:20:17,198
that's what we have to figure out is it is that an idea worth adhering to or not the alternative [is] the

1824
02:20:19,069 --> 02:20:25,118
[C4] the post Modernists the world is that landscape of pyramids that I described, but there's no

1825
02:20:25,819 --> 02:20:33,698
Transcendent vision that's over above that and all of those pyramids are equally valid and it's a war [of] everyone against everyone

1826
02:20:34,039 --> 02:20:40,929
It's like it's like the nightmare of hobbes thomas hobbes except that it's not individuals. It's groups and everyone's that group

1827
02:20:40,930 --> 02:20:45,970
You're a group. [you're] whatever your group is it's like that's death as far as I'm concerned

1828
02:20:46,039 --> 02:20:50,319
it's it's it's utterly reprehensible and

1829
02:20:51,079 --> 02:20:52,279
and

1830
02:20:52,279 --> 02:20:57,578
We better sort it out because if we don't sort it out. We are bloody well going to pay for it, so

1831
02:20:58,249 --> 02:21:00,249
Thank you

1832
02:21:05,979 --> 02:21:11,969
Hey, how's it going? I just want to say thank you for doing all this and I really appreciate that's Bob and doug mcKenzie

1833
02:21:11,970 --> 02:21:14,069
Right yeah, hey how's it going? Yeah?

1834
02:21:14,619 --> 02:21:18,779
I'm glad you caught that yeah yeah, yeah, well I did a Facebook poll

1835
02:21:19,090 --> 02:21:24,420
Yeah, people who are familiar with where your work and a question kind of rose to the top like just?

1836
02:21:24,999 --> 02:21:26,619
Right out of their lives

1837
02:21:26,619 --> 02:21:31,799
Spectacular and what it was you didn't really touch it here, but you touched it a bit in your lectures

1838
02:21:31,800 --> 02:21:37,109
It was about integrating the shadow yep, and one of [the] main questions was how does one

1839
02:21:37,779 --> 02:21:40,469
Go about that, especially in the Modern world. You know like

1840
02:21:41,260 --> 02:21:47,849
Really sheltered from anything resembling that kind of concept you know we don't engage like the unknown we don't

1841
02:21:48,189 --> 02:21:53,429
Come into life-or-death situations most of us [must] [rework] is like an ambulance. [you] know

1842
02:21:54,130 --> 02:21:58,409
Well, that's one thing you can do with that is one thing you can do. You know well?

1843
02:21:58,510 --> 02:22:01,559
Yeah, you can search out experiences that put you there

1844
02:22:02,140 --> 02:22:06,269
That's that's that's you know because well, you can do that as a volunteer for example

1845
02:22:06,270 --> 02:22:09,329
I mean, you can one of the things I saw once

1846
02:22:10,090 --> 02:22:13,739
[Within] montreal I was in this outdoor mall in Montreal on St.. Hubert and

1847
02:22:15,189 --> 02:22:17,879
saw this great big 17 year old kid you know and

1848
02:22:18,699 --> 02:22:20,879
He had a mohawk and he was dressed in leather

1849
02:22:20,880 --> 02:22:24,089
And he with you know studs and like he was he was

1850
02:22:24,189 --> 02:22:27,809
He was doing the water and Barbarian thing and he had it really down

1851
02:22:27,810 --> 02:22:30,989
And [you] know he's standing on the corner with two pink shopping bags

1852
02:22:30,989 --> 02:22:32,670
Hey, because look into him

1853
02:22:32,670 --> 02:22:35,549
And I thought you know if someone offered him the ID

1854
02:22:35,859 --> 02:22:42,479
The opportunity to drop those goddamn sleeping bags or shopping bags and go fight with isis

1855
02:22:42,670 --> 02:22:44,670
He'd be there in a second

1856
02:22:44,829 --> 02:22:50,969
Yeah, right, because what the hell is some monster like that doing standing on the corner of St.. Hubert alden [-] pink shopping bags

1857
02:22:53,619 --> 02:22:59,219
So I mean so some of it is that it you need you need to find out where you can push where you could you?

1858
02:22:59,220 --> 02:23:02,399
Can need to find out that edge that you can push yourself against the tree

1859
02:23:02,399 --> 02:23:04,399
It's going to be different for different people

1860
02:23:04,680 --> 02:23:07,889
But there's there's that's the call to adventure and heroism

1861
02:23:07,890 --> 02:23:14,309
And there are life and death situations everywhere around you if you want to involve yourself in them

1862
02:23:14,310 --> 02:23:14,851
you know

1863
02:23:14,851 --> 02:23:16,851
an idiot sometimes that might be

1864
02:23:16,870 --> 02:23:22,589
like to put yourself together to the degree that you can say physically or spiritually or intellectually it could be an

1865
02:23:22,690 --> 02:23:25,319
intellectual Battle it could be a Moral battle like the

1866
02:23:25,540 --> 02:23:27,011
Frontier is everywhere

1867
02:23:27,011 --> 02:23:33,240
the Frontier is just the Edge between what you know and what you don't know you want to put yourself on that damn edge and

1868
02:23:33,400 --> 02:23:39,720
Then make yourself into something and and you can retreat into comfort in the modern world, and I think that is a problem

1869
02:23:39,761 --> 02:23:41,761
You know I mean I've noticed that

1870
02:23:42,580 --> 02:23:46,919
It's one of the pathologies of wealth I would say because one of the problems with [being]

1871
02:23:47,141 --> 02:23:48,840
Relatively wealthy if you're a parent

1872
02:23:48,840 --> 02:23:56,100
is that you cannot provide your children with necessity, and that's a big problem, because they need necessity to call them into being and

1873
02:23:57,130 --> 02:24:02,040
You know if you don't have a lot of material resources and your children ask you for something you?

1874
02:24:02,290 --> 02:24:04,560
Can say no because no is the [answer] it's like

1875
02:24:04,561 --> 02:24:11,011
No, you can't do that, but if you can say yes, then it's really hard to say no because then you're just arbitrary well

1876
02:24:11,011 --> 02:24:11,761
I don't know

1877
02:24:11,761 --> 02:24:12,400
it's like

1878
02:24:12,400 --> 02:24:17,459
Kierkegaard said you know there will come a time when we have so much security and comfort that what we'll want more than anything else

1879
02:24:17,460 --> 02:24:19,061
is part

1880
02:24:19,061 --> 02:24:21,990
deprivation and challenge, and I think I think that's

1881
02:24:22,811 --> 02:24:24,811
particularly, what young men want

1882
02:24:25,120 --> 02:24:27,600
Now I think that that's partly because young women

1883
02:24:27,610 --> 02:24:34,050
they're stuck with that anyways because they have to it's it's it's the necessity of living in the world and

1884
02:24:34,601 --> 02:24:40,590
The responsibility of infant care in particular [like] that occupies them men have to do it voluntarily

1885
02:24:41,620 --> 02:24:45,690
Women now - because of the birth control pill, but you know that's [what] thirty years ago

1886
02:24:45,690 --> 02:24:48,329
We hardly have to talk [about] that at all yes, so

1887
02:24:49,061 --> 02:24:51,061
Then you have so much

1888
02:24:55,979 --> 02:25:02,299
Hi, Dr.. Peterson, so I'm actually a coptic orthodox and egyptian, so I found [you're] [talking] [a] incredibly interesting

1889
02:25:02,550 --> 02:25:08,269
I've also taken a deep interest in the old church fathers and as if you're talking about Iraqis I [arkin] back to St.

1890
02:25:08,340 --> 02:25:14,000
Athanasius when the idea feels is that you brought up last time that God became man so that man can become like God

1891
02:25:14,279 --> 02:25:19,639
So I was thinking about the systems of the hierarchies and is that an example [of] at the top of the pyramid the Hierarchy?

1892
02:25:19,739 --> 02:25:21,540
sort of gets inverted or

1893
02:25:21,540 --> 02:25:27,229
descends to the bottom and brings it up and to the top and that sort of an attraction to of Christianity that sort of

1894
02:25:27,359 --> 02:25:30,109
Made Christianity such a powerful idea. What are your thoughts on that? Oh?

1895
02:25:30,630 --> 02:25:37,460
well, it's certainly one [of] the I mean it's certainly one of the things that we not just Christianity a powerful idea because one of

1896
02:25:37,460 --> 02:25:40,040
the things that happened this was called the democratization of

1897
02:25:40,500 --> 02:25:45,620
Osiris if I remember correctly and like what happened see if I can answer this question

1898
02:25:45,930 --> 02:25:48,260
Using this approach for sex is that going to work?

1899
02:25:59,541 --> 02:26:01,541
Hmm, I

1900
02:26:02,211 --> 02:26:05,200
don't know if I can answer that [question] that way the the

1901
02:26:05,990 --> 02:26:07,990
part of the attraction of

1902
02:26:08,120 --> 02:26:15,250
Christianity, but this was something that emerged across time was the notion that even if you were in a lowly position that there was something

1903
02:26:15,251 --> 02:26:20,200
About you that was akin to the divine and now you might say well, that's just wish fulfillment

1904
02:26:20,230 --> 02:26:23,230
That's what freud would say that's what Marx would say right the opiate of the masses

1905
02:26:24,051 --> 02:26:26,770
Tweeted yesterday something. I thought was pretty funny which was that

1906
02:26:28,251 --> 02:26:30,110
like religion was the opiate of the masses

1907
02:26:30,110 --> 02:26:34,779
but that marxism was the methamphetamine of the max of the masses, so

1908
02:26:35,150 --> 02:26:40,239
So so I think the attraction was that it it [it]

1909
02:26:40,730 --> 02:26:46,779
Allowed people to recognize their intrinsic dignity and one of the things I've been thinking about is the juxtaposition

1910
02:26:47,030 --> 02:26:52,420
Between Genesis 1 and Genesis 2 because what I was in genesis 2 is that human beings collapse and fall?

1911
02:26:52,641 --> 02:26:58,060
right and then were these fallen creatures that no evil, but in the beginning in Genesis 1

1912
02:26:58,061 --> 02:27:00,761
It's really [an] optimistic story because it says well

1913
02:27:00,761 --> 02:27:04,990
we're the sorts of creatures that partake in the calling forth of being from Chaos and

1914
02:27:05,120 --> 02:27:12,190
Then that's in our essential nature and to some degree if you juxtapose both of those it's as if that's the entire biblical story

1915
02:27:13,041 --> 02:27:15,100
rammed Together in the first two chapters

1916
02:27:15,101 --> 02:27:18,101
Which is partly why we're taking so long to get through this by the way is that

1917
02:27:18,501 --> 02:27:25,660
to return to genesis 1 is the antidote to genesis 2 it's like to continue to Act out the

1918
02:27:25,851 --> 02:27:27,971
Doctrine that you're made in God's image

1919
02:27:27,971 --> 02:27:34,631
And that means that you're you're capable of speaking good being into existence through truth

1920
02:27:34,631 --> 02:27:38,530
And that that's also the antidote to the fall which I think is actually the fundamental

1921
02:27:39,860 --> 02:27:45,760
narrative message of the entire Biblical structure, and I also think of [western] civilization for that matter, so

1922
02:27:46,580 --> 02:27:48,790
There's a nobility and this is also

1923
02:27:48,791 --> 02:27:54,791
I think Nietzsche was fundamentally wrong in his [criticism] with Christianity because he thought about it and slaves morality you know the

1924
02:27:54,980 --> 02:27:56,980
vengeance of the bottom against the talk

1925
02:27:57,801 --> 02:28:01,810
That's more historical than theological so it gives dignity it

1926
02:28:03,771 --> 02:28:06,490
illuminates the dignity [of] the human being and

1927
02:28:08,001 --> 02:28:09,280
and

1928
02:28:09,280 --> 02:28:11,949
Requires responsibility so it's not just wish fulfillment

1929
02:28:11,950 --> 02:28:16,150
It's not freudian wish fulfillment the freudian theory which I thought about a lot is

1930
02:28:16,431 --> 02:28:23,471
Not tenable in my estimation it also doesn't account for the [existence] of hell because if it's only wish fulfillment, why bother with hell

1931
02:28:23,990 --> 02:28:25,431
It means a lot more

1932
02:28:25,431 --> 02:28:29,500
If you're really going to just fulfill a wish it's like everybody gets to go to Heaven no matter what they do

1933
02:28:29,500 --> 02:28:36,640
You don't have hell which was of course something absolutely terrifying to medieval Christians and then to plenty of people now for that matter

1934
02:28:37,011 --> 02:28:38,601
so

1935
02:28:38,601 --> 02:28:45,011
It's the nobility it's the idea of the nobility that I thinks deeply attractive to people, and that's all there is I mean

1936
02:28:45,530 --> 02:28:48,010
What you have to fight against your worm-like?

1937
02:28:48,681 --> 02:28:52,390
Fragile Mortal existence is the possibility of

1938
02:28:52,971 --> 02:28:59,920
Transcending that with nobility of speech and act. That's what you have and who can hear that without feeling

1939
02:29:01,130 --> 02:29:07,150
Ennoble by that now you might say well you might shudder and say well, I don't I can't bear the responsibility

1940
02:29:07,150 --> 02:29:14,199
[it's] like well fair enough, man. You know I mean that that's a reasonable criticism, but the consequence of not bearing the [responsibility] is

1941
02:29:14,750 --> 02:29:18,250
That's hell really so thank you

1942
02:29:24,660 --> 02:29:30,259
And thank you very much beautiful um I don't know feel familiar with the words of Nasan Talib

1943
02:29:30,870 --> 02:29:36,559
I'm reasonably familiar with them, so I think it's sad [to] say that he has

1944
02:29:37,470 --> 02:29:39,679
He talked about the idea that

1945
02:29:40,680 --> 02:29:43,700
People and especially modern people have a failure to recognize

1946
02:29:44,460 --> 02:29:46,460
the Unknown Unknowns

1947
02:29:46,650 --> 02:29:50,659
Yeah, such yes, right. That's a good way of thinking about it

1948
02:29:50,760 --> 02:29:55,639
Can you move the mic up a bit so that people can hear you a little better? Thanks gary. Yes um

1949
02:29:57,120 --> 02:30:00,950
Well, I was wondering do you think that that failure might?

1950
02:30:02,130 --> 02:30:05,990
Might be in some way related to the way that modern people

1951
02:30:07,170 --> 02:30:12,020
fail [to] relate to the idea of God so in the sense that

1952
02:30:14,521 --> 02:30:16,290
your people can't

1953
02:30:16,290 --> 02:30:19,099
Really grapple with the notion of God

1954
02:30:19,100 --> 02:30:24,950
I think as much as you can give a rational [argument] or you can't feel God in the way that perhaps a more religious person

1955
02:30:24,950 --> 02:30:26,010
or more

1956
02:30:26,010 --> 02:30:28,010
[an] older person might have

1957
02:30:28,860 --> 02:30:31,940
Felt God do you think that that inability to?

1958
02:30:32,580 --> 02:30:33,720
recognize

1959
02:30:33,720 --> 02:30:35,990
the Unknown Unknowns might play into

1960
02:30:36,690 --> 02:30:42,859
That yeah, well they're okay so that seems to be related to this idea of the absence of necessity

1961
02:30:43,410 --> 02:30:48,799
That's something like that. Is that no because I think that I think that what you're you're making a claim?

1962
02:30:49,050 --> 02:30:53,840
Maybe tell me if I've got it wrong that if you're sheltered too much

1963
02:30:54,720 --> 02:30:56,430
Then it also

1964
02:30:56,430 --> 02:30:59,090
It also separates you from anything that's divine

1965
02:30:59,090 --> 02:31:03,139
[I] guess that might be right because there's not enough intensity of the experience and something like that

1966
02:31:03,140 --> 02:31:08,000
is that is that part of the is that part of the issue it might be more related [to] the idea of

1967
02:31:09,000 --> 02:31:10,710
like

1968
02:31:10,710 --> 02:31:17,059
realizing the absolute infinite root of what you don't know like the like the mysterium tremendum that that kind of

1969
02:31:17,820 --> 02:31:24,049
You know if you believe that through statistical analysis you can get everything under control and you genuinely believe that at some point

1970
02:31:24,050 --> 02:31:29,630
You'll get it or wonder you know. Yeah, okay? Well, so okay, so so well, that's also

1971
02:31:29,630 --> 02:31:32,059
I think part of the danger of

1972
02:31:33,180 --> 02:31:37,940
Rationality that the Catholics have been implicitly warning again forever

1973
02:31:37,940 --> 02:31:43,789
Is that rather rational mind tends to fall in love with its own productions and then to worship them as absolutes?

1974
02:31:43,921 --> 02:31:46,130
Which is I think what [Melville] was trying to represent?

1975
02:31:46,381 --> 02:31:52,940
by his Satanic figure in Paradise lost [I] think about as like a precursor a prophetic precursor to the emergence of

1976
02:31:53,190 --> 02:31:57,499
Totalitarian states in the Modern world and so yeah, I think that you can believe that

1977
02:31:58,320 --> 02:32:00,320
What you know is?

1978
02:32:00,900 --> 02:32:05,119
Sufficient to Banish permanently what you don't know and I do think that that does

1979
02:32:06,240 --> 02:32:12,530
Paradoxically although you think that that would make you secure it also does destroy your relationship with with with with

1980
02:32:12,960 --> 02:32:19,160
With the spirit that might help you deal [with] what it [is] that you really don't know with the unknown unknowns, so [yeah]

1981
02:32:19,160 --> 02:32:23,240
I mean, we don't know to what degree extreme experience is necessary

1982
02:32:23,940 --> 02:32:26,119
to bring Forth extreme

1983
02:32:26,671 --> 02:32:30,950
Experience right what do you have to be through before you encounter a religious revelation?

1984
02:32:30,980 --> 02:32:35,810
Well people might say well, you can't because there's no such thing. It's like well. Don't be so sure about that

1985
02:32:36,261 --> 02:32:42,320
I mean people have reported them [to] row history, but they don't generally occur when your that's my favorite tropen

1986
02:32:42,320 --> 02:32:46,550
You're eating [cheesie's] [and] playing you know and playing Mario brothers, right?

1987
02:32:47,700 --> 02:32:52,850
So yeah, so that's the best I can do with that engine yes. Yeah

1988
02:32:57,900 --> 02:33:00,020
This has to be the last question [all] right

1989
02:33:00,021 --> 02:33:02,570
I'll make it quick yeah earlier when you talked about

1990
02:33:03,061 --> 02:33:09,950
Criminality and creativity trends in that in men peaking at 14 it reminded me of something. You said, I think it was Joe Rogan

1991
02:33:10,681 --> 02:33:12,681
[talking] about Sjw's and

1992
02:33:13,021 --> 02:33:18,381
Kind of and how they create their own Chaos talking about how adolescents have this drive to change the world

1993
02:33:18,570 --> 02:33:24,470
And I was wondering if if those three the criminality creativity drive to change the world are

1994
02:33:24,750 --> 02:33:28,580
linked and if so if they manifest differently in men and women

1995
02:33:29,190 --> 02:33:33,020
And if they [kind] of come from the same, era well, I think they are linked

1996
02:33:33,570 --> 02:33:36,409
But I'm going to concentrate more on the net second part of your question

1997
02:33:36,601 --> 02:33:41,060
So I'm going to ask you two guys some think about something, so I talked to a friend of mine the other day

1998
02:33:41,061 --> 02:33:43,971
He's a very very smart guy and we've been talking about

1999
02:33:44,641 --> 02:33:50,091
While all the sorts of things that we've been [talking] about tonight for a long time and we were talking about the relatively

2000
02:33:50,580 --> 02:33:55,340
relative evolutionary roles of men and women this is speculative obviously and and

2001
02:33:56,040 --> 02:34:01,820
Because our research did indicate it's tentative research so far that that the the sgs

2002
02:34:02,431 --> 02:34:07,820
Sjw Sort of equality above all else Philosophy is more prevalent among women

2003
02:34:08,790 --> 02:34:15,980
Well, it's predicted by the personality factors that are more common among women so agreeable this and high negative emotion

2004
02:34:16,710 --> 02:34:19,160
primarily agreeableness, but in addition

2005
02:34:19,160 --> 02:34:20,990
It's also predicted by being female

2006
02:34:20,990 --> 02:34:27,020
And that's interesting because in most of the personality research that I've done and as far as I know in the literature at

2007
02:34:27,570 --> 02:34:32,060
you know in more broadly speaking most of the time you can get rid of the

2008
02:34:32,341 --> 02:34:36,560
attitudinal differences between men and women or at least reduce them [by] controlling for personality

2009
02:34:36,601 --> 02:34:41,721
so if you take a feminine man, and a masculine woman then you know that the [polls]

2010
02:34:42,690 --> 02:34:48,529
reverse but that didn't seem to be the case with political correctness, and so I've been thinking about that a lot because

2011
02:34:49,230 --> 02:34:51,949
well men [are] bailing out of the humanities like mad and

2012
02:34:52,261 --> 02:34:56,120
Pretty much out of the universities except for stem the women are moving in like mad

2013
02:34:56,120 --> 02:34:59,480
And they're also moving into the political sphere like math

2014
02:34:59,480 --> 02:35:02,810
And this is new right we've never had this happen before and we do know [no]

2015
02:35:02,811 --> 02:35:06,351
do not know what the significance of it is it's only 50 years old and

2016
02:35:06,631 --> 02:35:13,790
So we were thinking about this and so, I don't know what you think about this proposition, but imagine that that historically speaking

2017
02:35:14,910 --> 02:35:16,680
it's something like

2018
02:35:16,680 --> 02:35:20,479
Women were responsible for distribution and men were responsible for production

2019
02:35:21,540 --> 02:35:27,589
Something like that, and maybe maybe that's only the case really in the tight confines of the immediate family

2020
02:35:27,590 --> 02:35:31,399
But that doesn't matter because that's most of the evolutionary landscape for human beings anyways

2021
02:35:31,399 --> 02:35:34,759
What the women does it did was make sure that everybody got enough?

2022
02:35:35,820 --> 02:35:43,039
okay, and that seems to me to be one of the things that's driving at least in part the Sjw demand for for equity and

2023
02:35:43,040 --> 02:35:47,540
Equality it's like let's make sure everybody [has] enough. It's like both look fair enough

2024
02:35:47,540 --> 02:35:49,820
You know I mean you can't you can't argue with that

2025
02:35:50,149 --> 02:35:56,719
But there's there's an antipathy between that and the [the] reality of differential productivity

2026
02:35:56,720 --> 02:35:59,990
[you] know because people really do differ in their productivity, so

2027
02:36:00,960 --> 02:36:07,070
All right, so to answer your question fully. I do think that the rebellious tendency of adolescence is

2028
02:36:07,590 --> 02:36:12,049
Associated both with that criminality spike, especially among men and with creativity. Yes

2029
02:36:12,050 --> 02:36:15,469
I think that the sJw phenomena is different

2030
02:36:15,470 --> 02:36:20,420
and I think it is associated at least in part with the rise of women to political power and and

2031
02:36:21,090 --> 02:36:26,030
We don't know what women are life when they have political power because they've never had it

2032
02:36:26,030 --> 02:36:27,050
I mean

2033
02:36:27,050 --> 02:36:31,219
There's been [queens] obviously and that sort of thing [just] being female authority figures and females have

2034
02:36:31,560 --> 02:36:35,090
Wielded far more power historically than feminists generally like to admit

2035
02:36:35,100 --> 02:36:42,229
But this is a different thing and we don't know what [a] truly female political philosophy would be like but it might be

2036
02:36:42,810 --> 02:36:47,810
Especially if it's not been well examined and it isn't very sophisticated conceptually it could easily be well

2037
02:36:47,810 --> 02:36:50,540
Let's make sure things are distributed equally well yeah

2038
02:36:50,610 --> 02:36:56,059
But sorry that's that's just not going to do you fly do you think in terms of the rest of this?

2039
02:36:56,220 --> 02:37:01,460
Jw's and you talked about last lecture as well creating Chaos when there is none otherwise. It'd be static

2040
02:37:01,470 --> 02:37:07,849
Do you think there would be any validity in saying that in a country [like] Canada were pretty gender equal is

2041
02:37:08,100 --> 02:37:11,360
There any merit to thinking Sjw's are trying to create Chaos

2042
02:37:12,360 --> 02:37:16,669
Even when they're arguably is none on the mass level obviously there's still problems

2043
02:37:16,680 --> 02:37:22,910
Why would they do that otherwise it would be static and that well doesn't if it wouldn't for them

2044
02:37:22,910 --> 02:37:26,840
So I read this I read this quote once and I don't remember who

2045
02:37:27,391 --> 02:37:32,750
Who said it it might have been robert heinlein for crying out loud science fiction author that Springs to mind

2046
02:37:32,750 --> 02:37:34,620
But a problem it probably wasn't

2047
02:37:34,620 --> 02:37:40,880
And his the proposition was that men tested ideas and that women tested men, and I kind of like that

2048
02:37:41,700 --> 02:37:47,630
There's something about that. You know and now it obviously it's an [over] [generalization], but we also don't know to what degree

2049
02:37:48,660 --> 02:37:50,660
women test men Cheerilee through

2050
02:37:51,360 --> 02:37:55,369
Provocation it's a lot because like if you want to test someone you don't have a like little

2051
02:37:55,591 --> 02:37:57,770
Conversation [with] them like you [poke] the hell out of them

2052
02:37:57,771 --> 02:38:03,080
And you say okay like I'm going to let go after you and see where your weak spots are and it seems to me that

2053
02:38:03,080 --> 02:38:05,960
This it seems to me that in this constant

2054
02:38:06,780 --> 02:38:14,390
protest and use of shame and all of that that goes along with this with this sort of radical movement towards egalitarianism that there's a

2055
02:38:14,610 --> 02:38:16,610
Tremendous amount of provocation and

2056
02:38:17,790 --> 02:38:19,641
God, I'm going to say this too even though

2057
02:38:19,641 --> 02:38:24,500
I shouldn't but it but we mean how I don't believe this, but I'm trying trying to figure it out

2058
02:38:24,711 --> 02:38:26,750
You know I thought it was absolutely

2059
02:38:27,030 --> 02:38:33,470
Comical when [fifty] [Shades] of [Grey] came out a not just I [just] thought that was just so insanely comical that at the same time

2060
02:38:33,811 --> 02:38:39,620
there's this massive political demand for like radical equality and and

2061
02:38:40,351 --> 02:38:45,711
And say with regards to sexual behavior and the fastest-selling novel the world had ever seen

2062
02:38:46,141 --> 02:38:52,790
Was S&M domination right? It's like. Oh, well. We know where the unconscious is going with that one don't leave and

2063
02:38:53,671 --> 02:38:57,860
and sometimes I think like because one of the things that I've really tried to puzzle out and

2064
02:38:57,931 --> 02:38:59,931
It's not like I believe this right

2065
02:38:59,931 --> 02:39:05,030
I'm just telling you what I wear the edges of my thinking of being going is that you have this crazy

2066
02:39:05,311 --> 02:39:10,131
Alliance between the feminists and the radical islamist that I just do not get it's like the [feminists]

2067
02:39:10,131 --> 02:39:13,700
[it's] like why they aren't protesting non-stop about Saudi

2068
02:39:13,771 --> 02:39:15,181
Arabia is just

2069
02:39:15,181 --> 02:39:16,910
Completely Beyond me

2070
02:39:16,910 --> 02:39:17,820
like I do not

2071
02:39:17,820 --> 02:39:24,800
Understand it in the least and I wonder - I just wonder bloody well is this is the [freudian] means that is there an attraction?

2072
02:39:24,931 --> 02:39:29,931
You know the is there an attraction that's emerging among the female radicals for that

2073
02:39:30,570 --> 02:39:34,550
Totalitarian male dominance that they've chased out of the [west]

2074
02:39:34,551 --> 02:39:38,190
And I mean that's a hell of a thing to think but I after all I am

2075
02:39:38,740 --> 02:39:45,510
[psychoanalytically] [minded] and I do think things like that because like [I] just can see no rational reason for it the only other

2076
02:39:45,641 --> 02:39:52,590
Rational reason is that well the west needs to fall and so the enemy of my enemy is our [yeah]

2077
02:39:52,590 --> 02:39:58,049
It's a guy exactly now. What is it? I thought that wrong with the enemy of enemy is my friends

2078
02:39:58,110 --> 02:40:01,230
Yes, exactly [so] Elements tend to vote liberal as well. Yes

2079
02:40:01,230 --> 02:40:02,641
Well, so that that could be the case

2080
02:40:02,641 --> 02:40:10,261
but I am not going to shake my suspicions about this unconscious balancing because as the demand for

2081
02:40:10,990 --> 02:40:13,919
egalitarianism and the eradication of masculinity

2082
02:40:14,980 --> 02:40:22,859
Accelerates there's going to be a longing in the unconscious for the precise opposite for the [problem] of that right the more you want you?

2083
02:40:22,900 --> 02:40:26,699
Scream for equality the more your unconscious is going to admire

2084
02:40:27,311 --> 02:40:28,601
Dominance and

2085
02:40:28,601 --> 02:40:29,681
so

2086
02:40:29,681 --> 02:40:34,170
Well, that's that's that's well. That's how you think if your cycle analytically minded

2087
02:40:34,181 --> 02:40:36,480
And you know I'm a great admirer of freud

2088
02:40:36,480 --> 02:40:41,399
he knew a hell of a lot [more] than people like to think and and so which is partly why everyone still hates him even

2089
02:40:41,400 --> 02:40:46,289
Though it's late a hundred years since he's you know really really being around so all right. We should stop
