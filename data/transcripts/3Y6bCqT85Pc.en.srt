[Music]

00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:16,800
[Applause]

3
00:00:13,839 --> 00:00:18,000
hello everyone hello it's been a very

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,080
strange

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,680
day so I'm going to tell you about what

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:28,039
happened and then I'll start the lecture

7
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:31,599
so I got up this morning and

8
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:35,079
uh started to put my together and then I

9
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:38,360
tried to sign into my Gmail

10
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:41,960
account and it said that it had been

11
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:44,079
disabled because I violated the terms of

12
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,520
service with

13
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:48,960
Gmail and I

14
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:52,320
thought well I didn't violate any terms

15
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:54,199
of service that I know of now I set up a

16
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,840
new YouTube channel yesterday called

17
00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:58,760
Jordan B Peterson clips and so we made

18
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,719
some technical changes and so I thought

19
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:03,440
maybe it had something to do with with

20
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:07,600
that and I had been shout out of Google

21
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:09,240
one other time years ago so when you get

22
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,119
shut out like

23
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:14,759
that there's a little form you can fill

24
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:18,320
out and so I filled out the form and I

25
00:01:14,759 --> 00:01:21,560
said that I had been shut out and uh

26
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:25,000
that I didn't know why and I sent it off

27
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:27,840
and then I realized one of my staff

28
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,200
members called me and said that she was

29
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,960
locked out of the YouTube account and I

30
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:34,159
thought oh yeah the YouTube account is

31
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:35,799
hooked to the Gmail account so that

32
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,479
meant that I couldn't get access to any

33
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:39,320
of my YouTube videos they were still up

34
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:40,759
and online but I couldn't get access to

35
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:44,360
them I couldn't post last week's

36
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:47,040
biblical lecture for for for example and

37
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:50,680
so that was worrisome and made me

38
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,560
suspicious and then about two hours

39
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:55,759
later something like that I got an email

40
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:59,439
from Google and they said that they had

41
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:02,119
reviewed the my request to be reinstated

42
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:04,719
and that I had violated Google's terms

43
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:06,240
of agreement or terms of service and

44
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:07,080
they weren't going to turn my account

45
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,360
back

46
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:11,599
on and I

47
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,520
thought and they didn't say why they

48
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,040
didn't say anything I got there was no

49
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,879
warning whatsoever about any of this

50
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,680
they didn't tell me why and they didn't

51
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:21,920
say why in the email response and so I

52
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:25,319
wrote them back and I said because they

53
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:28,760
said I could I wrote them back and I

54
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:31,000
said this might not be a good idea

55
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:33,160
basically

56
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,400
and you might want to think about it and

57
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:37,080
then I tweeted tweeted what had happened

58
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,120
right I took screenshots and I tweeted

59
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:41,319
and I contacted a whole bunch of

60
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,879
journalists because it turns out that I

61
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:47,200
know a whole bunch of journalists and

62
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:51,519
so and so then what happened then was

63
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:54,319
that um I got a call from The Daily

64
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,879
Caller in the United States I had done

65
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:58,760
an interview with them last week which

66
00:02:55,879 --> 00:03:01,519
isn't posted yet and they interviewed me

67
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:03,760
and within 20 minutes posted it online

68
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:05,280
and so they have a fairly big audience

69
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,120
and so that was good and then somebody

70
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,040
phoned me from Ottawa and I did a live

71
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:12,120
radio show about that and that was good

72
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:13,680
and then a number of other journalists

73
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:17,000
contacted me and I sent them the

74
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:19,159
information but another one of my staff

75
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,640
actually my son emailed me and he said

76
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:22,560
look you should hold off because maybe

77
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,680
there's still a mistake here and I

78
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,599
thought yeah there might be it might be

79
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:29,879
just a mistake but then why in the world

80
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:31,439
did I email Google and they contacted

81
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:33,319
and they said they would not reinstate

82
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:36,439
it and they didn't provide me with any

83
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:37,959
information so I contacted the other

84
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:40,000
journalists and I said well you never

85
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:42,799
know maybe this is just a mistake so

86
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
let's hold off and then while I was

87
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,519
about half an hour later while I was

88
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,400
trying to get into my I use this AdWords

89
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,599
account that's linked to Google I don't

90
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,840
run ads on my videos but I need the

91
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,799
AdWords account because it helps me add

92
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,519
some little gadgets to the videos that I

93
00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:00,200
wouldn't otherwise be able to and I was

94
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:03,720
I was playing with that the system came

95
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:05,720
back online I thought well that's

96
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,799
interesting and lots of people had

97
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,400
emailed me and twittered me and some

98
00:04:07,799 --> 00:04:11,200
people within Google and some people

99
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,720
elsewhere and they were doing whatever

100
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,680
they were going to do to help me get all

101
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,560
this material back up and running and so

102
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:20,160
something worked my suspicions are that

103
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:23,160
what worked was the publicity now so but

104
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,759
maybe not you know and it's very weird

105
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:28,880
being in this situation because there

106
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:31,080
has been a number of recent episodes

107
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:34,320
where these larger companies Facebook

108
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:35,720
Google patreon not that it's a massive

109
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:39,560
company but it's starting to become

110
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:41,520
reasonably significant have decided on

111
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:44,039
rather arbitrary grounds to shut down

112
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:47,720
their users and this is very ominous to

113
00:04:44,039 --> 00:04:49,759
me partly because we've we've turned our

114
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,680
Communications over to very large

115
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,520
systems or very large systems have

116
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,960
emerged to mediate our communication

117
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,320
right I mean there's lots of benefit to

118
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,400
it so you don't want to get too cynical

119
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:03,240
about it but we're blind with regards to

120
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:05,199
the policies that regulate the the the

121
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:06,840
actions the regulatory actions of these

122
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:08,600
large organizations and that's really a

123
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,440
bad thing and something else is even

124
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:14,199
more ominous really ominous you know

125
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,800
it's highly probable that we're going to

126
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:18,520
build political algorithms into our

127
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,280
artificial intelligence and this sort of

128
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:22,600
thing will be regulated by machines that

129
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:25,759
no one understands and that's a really

130
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:28,240
bad idea and that's a really likely

131
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,880
possibility so anyways I was all

132
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,080
confused about this I thought Jesus

133
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:34,680
maybe I flew off the handle you know

134
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:37,280
because I was sort of it was stressful

135
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:38,919
man you know because I have like 150,000

136
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:41,720
emails in that account like that's a lot

137
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:43,360
of emails and it's all my correspondence

138
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:46,680
for the last 10 years you know so it's

139
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:48,479
an archive as well as an ongoing email

140
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,680
system I have a commercial email system

141
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,440
that I just set up three weeks ago with

142
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:54,240
like six different email addresses now

143
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,240
to try to organize my correspondent so I

144
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,319
wasn't completely unable to communicate

145
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:59,960
but my calendar was gone and that's a

146
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,000
bloody disaster because because like

147
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,840
I've got things scheduled out forever

148
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,840
and I don't remember what they are I

149
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:09,199
can't even remember what I'm doing in a

150
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,800
day so much less in a month but I

151
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,120
thought maybe I flew off the handle and

152
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:14,360
I was worried that I contacted the

153
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:18,080
journalist too soon and you know but

154
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:20,199
anyways it all worked out so then what

155
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,759
happened well just as I was coming to

156
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:24,960
this lecture I stepped outside and there

157
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:27,840
was a little package outside luckily it

158
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,599
wasn't a bomb there's a there's a

159
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,039
package outside nice little package we

160
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:32,360
looked my wife and I looked inside it

161
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,280
and there was a couple of bottles of

162
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,680
wine in there so that was nice and there

163
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,120
was a little note and so I'm going to

164
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,400
read you the little note because it's

165
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:41,400
actually pretty

166
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,400
interesting

167
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,840
so so this person said that they had

168
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:49,639
finally tackled the self-authoring suite

169
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:52,440
so they seem to be happy about that but

170
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:54,759
that's not so interesting except

171
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:56,479
peripherally a friend on Twitter has

172
00:06:54,759 --> 00:07:00,039
contact with Google

173
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:02,680
Engineers she said quote I spoke with

174
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:04,960
some friends inside Google who offered

175
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:06,680
to help and I did get contacted by quite

176
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:08,319
a few people at Google who said that

177
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:10,759
they had been you know watching my

178
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,919
lectures and so on and were happy about

179
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:14,360
what I was

180
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:16,639
doing anyways I spoke with some friends

181
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:19,599
inside Google who offered to help but

182
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:21,560
they suggest he set up a backup plan the

183
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:23,360
teams are feeling significant pressure

184
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:27,599
from advocacy

185
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:29,599
groups and quote I have at least four

186
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:32,240
Google Engineers who offered to speak up

187
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:33,800
on his behalf but they know the Team

188
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:37,319
Dynamics and

189
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:40,039
unfortunately especially YouTube is an

190
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:42,360
sjw

191
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:44,759
Cesspool I hope this information is

192
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:48,599
useful to you it's like yeah it's kind

193
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:53,039
of useful all right so that was that was

194
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:55,319
part of what happened today and so

195
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:57,319
anyways I still don't really understand

196
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:59,759
it right because I don't know why it got

197
00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:01,599
shut down and I don't know if anything I

198
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,360
did got it turned back on and I don't

199
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:07,840
know the reasons for it and that's also

200
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:11,560
rather ominous it seems to me that when

201
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:13,280
I was thinking it through and was that

202
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:15,960
you know I have a

203
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,879
fairly what would you call it

204
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,159
respectable YouTube following I don't

205
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:21,639
know if you'd necessarily call it

206
00:08:19,159 --> 00:08:24,720
respectable it's fairly large YouTube

207
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:28,080
following and it seems to me that it

208
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:30,159
would have been appropriate for Google

209
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:34,159
if they were going to shut down my

210
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:36,880
account to tell me why I would think and

211
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:39,120
also maybe look me up maybe especially

212
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,919
after I emailed them and then maybe not

213
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:43,159
to have emailed me back and said no

214
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:44,760
we're not going to reinstate you but

215
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:46,080
we're not going to tell you any reasons

216
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:48,080
they didn't say they wouldn't tell me

217
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,399
any reasons they just didn't tell me any

218
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,760
reasons and then it also seems very

219
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:58,200
strange to me that it just all of a

220
00:08:52,760 --> 00:09:00,760
sudden went back on after two hours and

221
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:02,079
so well so I don't know what to make of

222
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:05,519
that maybe

223
00:09:02,079 --> 00:09:07,279
more information will come to light over

224
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:11,120
the next few days I hope that I didn't

225
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:13,640
jump the gun but it's very a very

226
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:16,399
peculiar set of circumstances I thought

227
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:18,079
it was kind of amusing actually that the

228
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,519
video that they stopped me from posting

229
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:21,880
today was the last biblical lecture you

230
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:23,240
wouldn't necessarily think that that

231
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:26,079
would be the sort of thing that people

232
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:29,920
would want to stop from being posted but

233
00:09:26,079 --> 00:09:33,279
um we're in very very strange times

234
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,680
so that was my adventure for today and

235
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:37,120
so I

236
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:38,920
didn't you know I hate speakers who

237
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,800
apologize to the crowd before they talk

238
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:43,640
to them because you

239
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:45,160
know if you're speaking to people and

240
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:46,240
they've put all this effort into coming

241
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:48,560
then you shouldn't tell them what a

242
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,880
sorry and useless creature you are

243
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,880
before you talk to them you know and ask

244
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,880
for their forbearance and forgiveness

245
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,040
it's like it's a little you're a little

246
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,959
late for that but I'm still going to do

247
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,200
that a little bit today because you know

248
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:03,200
I wanted to spend all day preparing this

249
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,839
lecture I mean I've prepared it a lot

250
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,120
beforehand but that rattled me up a lot

251
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:11,160
and so I didn't prepare as much as I

252
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:15,440
could have anyways we'll stumble forward

253
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:18,399
and see how it goes I I'm I'm I'm

254
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:19,279
reasonably familiar with the stories now

255
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,720
and

256
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:24,560
so onward and

257
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:26,880
upward so I'm going to reiterate this

258
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:30,000
you know I've learned

259
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:32,120
something I have this idea that it would

260
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,920
be a good idea for young people and and

261
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:37,360
older people citizens of the West let's

262
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:40,040
say to learn more about their

263
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,920
culture and their civilization right

264
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:44,240
because it's a great civilization and

265
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,639
it's it's it's taken a lot of work to

266
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:48,880
put together but I don't think that we

267
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:50,399
really know I mean I know a fair bit

268
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,399
about it although I wouldn't consider

269
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:56,160
myself nearly as educated as a person

270
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:59,839
should be but I'm not too badly educated

271
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:02,399
and but I tell you going through these

272
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:04,399
biblical lectures verse by verse just

273
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:07,279
makes me even more aware of how

274
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:09,639
unbelievably ignorant I am you know and

275
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:11,040
partly for two two reasons like one is

276
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:13,680
because I've been using this

277
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:15,680
biblehub.com place and I think I told

278
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:18,079
you last week but I wanted to reiterate

279
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,120
it because it's important it's so

280
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,760
interesting the way that they've set it

281
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:25,120
up because you can go through the

282
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:27,720
biblical stories verse by verse and then

283
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:30,040
for each verse there's a whole small

284
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:32,320
font page of comment from multiple

285
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:34,959
sources and so you know not only is the

286
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,480
Bible hyper hyperlink in the way that I

287
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,120
discussed in the first lecture with all

288
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:40,480
the verses referring to not all the

289
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:43,519
other verses but lots of them but it's

290
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:45,880
un it's got its tendrils out into

291
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:48,360
literature you know direct commentaries

292
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:50,279
on the text but also all the all the

293
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:52,120
literature that's been influenced by it

294
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:54,639
so it's it's it's an unbelievably

295
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:58,000
Central and core text and it's so

296
00:11:54,639 --> 00:12:00,440
interesting to read a book where every

297
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,320
sentence has been commented on well

298
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:04,399
really in volumes and then just to get a

299
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:06,399
sense of that volume of material you

300
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:09,800
know how much power brain power there's

301
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:11,959
been put into this and and to also

302
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:14,720
understand how Bloody ignorant like I'm

303
00:12:11,959 --> 00:12:17,240
so ignorant about this there's all this

304
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:19,199
work and and it seems that we've left it

305
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:21,120
to decay in the dust and it's a big

306
00:12:19,199 --> 00:12:22,959
mistake man it's a big mistake because

307
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,720
the people who were writing these

308
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:26,720
commentary it's like you know a lot of

309
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,000
it's from the 14th and 15th and 16th

310
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,800
century it's kind of archaic and it's

311
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,040
it's some of it's outdated and some of

312
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,399
it you wouldn't agree with but if you

313
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:36,079
read all the commentaries side by side

314
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,399
you know you get a pretty good blast of

315
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:40,079
wisdom coming at you and like the thing

316
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,880
about wisdom is it stops you from

317
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:45,680
running face first into walls you know

318
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,680
it's not just there to to so that you

319
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,880
can talk to people at parties about what

320
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,680
university you graduated from you know

321
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:54,639
and it it's there because the the

322
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,800
information is unbelievably useful you

323
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:57,199
know one of the things that I've

324
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,639
realized that I want to return to

325
00:12:57,199 --> 00:13:00,639
tonight because I've been thinking a lot

326
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:02,199
about this idea of the Ark you know and

327
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:04,720
I I think I mentioned to you last week

328
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:06,399
that I'd figured out that there was this

329
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,920
idea that Noah was perfect in his

330
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,519
generations and that meant that he had

331
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:11,399
set his family in order it wasn't just

332
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,959
him but he had set his family in order

333
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:15,600
and because of that when when the

334
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:17,839
catastrophe came like it comes to

335
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:19,959
everyone he was able to withstand it

336
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,959
because he had the support of the people

337
00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:23,760
who were near and dear to him and that's

338
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:26,279
really important when things come along

339
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:29,120
to lay you low like if you're alone and

340
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:31,560
and the flood comes it's like man

341
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:33,440
goodbye to you if you've got 10 or 15

342
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:35,360
people supporting you in a tight Network

343
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,040
you know and and your your inter

344
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,839
relationships with them are pristine and

345
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:41,040
you can tell them the truth and they can

346
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:43,079
tell the truth back to you it's possible

347
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,920
that you might be able to find that thin

348
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:49,000
way that will preserve you when when

349
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:51,680
when when you know the Terrible Things

350
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,600
come knocking at your door and so

351
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,720
there's this the the idea of the Ark is

352
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:59,240
very very Concrete in Noah it's actually

353
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,360
a structure that that he and habits you

354
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:04,000
know it's a concretized almost like a

355
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,399
child story and I'm not being cynical

356
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,000
about that because there are some bloody

357
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:09,480
brilliant child children's stories but

358
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,399
you know it's really concretized but

359
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:14,000
then Abraham comes along and instead of

360
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:16,160
an ark there's a covenant right now it

361
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:17,880
says in the story of Noah that Noah

362
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:20,120
walked with God and and of course

363
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:22,000
Abraham it isn't clear exactly that he's

364
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:24,440
walking with God or before God which

365
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,000
we'll get into later but you see I see

366
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:29,800
this as part of the increasing psych

367
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:33,040
psychologization of the sacred ideas

368
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:35,399
that were acted out by archaic people so

369
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:38,120
first of all it's concretized in the

370
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:40,040
form of a a ship that actually sustains

371
00:14:38,120 --> 00:14:41,639
you when the floods come right it's it's

372
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:44,079
very concrete imagery the sort of thing

373
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:46,040
you might see in a movie but then with

374
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:47,680
Abraham it turns into a psychological

375
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:49,920
Covenant in some sense it's like a

376
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,399
contractual agreement now it's a cont

377
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:54,279
it's a contractual agreement between

378
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:56,279
Abraham and God but but that doesn't

379
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:59,480
really matter that I mean obviously it

380
00:14:56,279 --> 00:15:01,320
matters but it's that it's it's only

381
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:03,279
it's only half of what's important about

382
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:06,720
that the other half is that it's a

383
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:08,800
contract and you know one of the things

384
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,560
that you do with your ideal let's say is

385
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,320
you establish a contract with it you

386
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,000
also establish like a social contract

387
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:16,360
with other people right that that's what

388
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,639
keeps society organized and so there's

389
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:21,079
this idea that emerges in the Abraham

390
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:24,240
stories of a sacred contract and that

391
00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:25,600
has the same function as the arc and

392
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:27,360
what it does because what happens in

393
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,319
Abraham we'll see more of this today is

394
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,839
that he

395
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:32,519
you know God tells him to go forward

396
00:15:30,839 --> 00:15:33,839
into the world and we we talked about

397
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:35,600
that last week and he does that he

398
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:37,319
encounters famine and he encounters

399
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,440
tyranny and he encounters powerful

400
00:15:37,319 --> 00:15:41,759
people who want to take from him what is

401
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:43,079
his I mean God sends him out in the

402
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:45,040
world but it's not like he has an easy

403
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:47,160
ride of it it isn't easy at all it's as

404
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,880
hard as it can be but there's this

405
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:51,199
consistent emphasis in the text and I

406
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:53,880
think it's something really worth

407
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:56,120
attending to that if you maintain your

408
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:58,120
contract which and that has that has to

409
00:15:56,120 --> 00:16:00,279
do with honesty and trust and truth and

410
00:15:58,120 --> 00:16:02,079
all of those things if you maintain your

411
00:16:00,279 --> 00:16:03,839
contract then you have a good

412
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:05,880
possibility the best possible

413
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:08,360
possibility of making your way through

414
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:10,800
the catastrophy in the chaos and I I

415
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:13,319
don't want to be naive about this you

416
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,319
know when I read Jung and I started to

417
00:16:13,319 --> 00:16:16,240
understand the idea of the hero

418
00:16:14,319 --> 00:16:19,079
archetype you know the idea that the

419
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:21,120
human being is a is a force a logos

420
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:23,720
force that can stand up against chaos

421
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:26,000
and catastrophe and tragedy and evil and

422
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:28,079
Prevail I never did think that that

423
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,199
meant that if you did stand up and and

424
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:31,800
tell the truth that you would

425
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:33,800
necessarily Prevail right it's not it's

426
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,880
not it's not a magic trick it's your

427
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:39,319
best bet that's the thing you don't have

428
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:41,000
a better option and so and that's what's

429
00:16:39,319 --> 00:16:43,279
that's what that see the idea is

430
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,800
emerging in in the abrahamic text it's

431
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:46,519
like people are figuring this out that

432
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:48,199
would be progressive revelation that's

433
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:50,399
one way of thinking about it and you can

434
00:16:48,199 --> 00:16:52,199
think about that religious terms but you

435
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:54,800
can also think about it as Humanity

436
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:56,480
Consulting itself right each individual

437
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:58,440
talking to themselves which is what we

438
00:16:56,480 --> 00:17:00,399
do when we when we think and each indiv

439
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:03,279
idual communicating with every other

440
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:06,319
individual and Gathering a body of

441
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:08,160
wisdom that helps people or Orient

442
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:10,679
themselves in the toughest conditions

443
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,160
and it it's an incremental process and I

444
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:15,959
think that I really do believe that

445
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:17,720
that's speaking purely secularly I do

446
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:19,319
believe that that's what manifests

447
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:21,480
itself in the biblical stories right

448
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:23,880
it's the dawning Enlightenment of

449
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:25,959
mankind something like that as we start

450
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:27,640
to understand the principles by which we

451
00:17:25,959 --> 00:17:29,520
have to live in order to orient

452
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:33,880
ourselves properly in the

453
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:36,240
world so and I also do believe and this

454
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:38,679
is this is the thing that's the unspoken

455
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:42,960
question is like you don't you don't

456
00:17:38,679 --> 00:17:46,400
have any idea how rich and fulfilling

457
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:49,360
your life could be despite its tragedy

458
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:51,080
and limitation if you stop doing the

459
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:53,320
things that you know to be wrong it's a

460
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:55,360
really Grand experiment and you know one

461
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:57,880
of the things that God tells Abraham

462
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:59,600
constantly as as the story progresses

463
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:02,960
especially every time Abraham makes a

464
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:05,480
sacrifice is God says walk with me and

465
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:09,440
be perfect it's something like that and

466
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:11,039
and so the injunction is well aim high

467
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,880
establish this relationship with the

468
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:15,039
highest thing that you can conceive of

469
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:16,280
which you might as well do that because

470
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:18,600
well what are you going to do establish

471
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:20,200
a relationship with the most mediocre

472
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,440
thing you can conceive of or you're

473
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:23,480
going to establish a relationship with

474
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:26,080
the lowest thing you can conceive of

475
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:28,679
people do that and I wouldn't recommend

476
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:30,840
it it's a really bad thing and there's a

477
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:33,480
lot of pain associated with that and

478
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:36,480
maybe you know there's there's pain that

479
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:38,039
can expand into a world destroying Force

480
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,919
down that route and there's absolutely

481
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:42,120
no doubt about that so what is there

482
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:44,240
something superstitious and foolish

483
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:46,880
about attempting to establish a

484
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:50,480
contractual relationship with the source

485
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:54,200
of all being I mean I I I just don't see

486
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:57,600
that as a as an erroneous conception and

487
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:59,919
you know it's not necessary perhaps to

488
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:01,840
get lost in the details we can argue

489
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:04,320
forever about what God might or might

490
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:07,080
not be but we could at least say that

491
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:09,400
the concept of God is an embodiment of

492
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:11,320
Humanity's highest ideal right we could

493
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:13,799
at least agree on that and then you

494
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:16,480
might say well is that real and the

495
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:17,840
first thing I would say about that is ah

496
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:19,799
there's a lot of things about the world

497
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:22,720
we don't understand and the second thing

498
00:19:19,799 --> 00:19:24,840
I would say is it depends bloody well on

499
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:26,159
what you mean by real that's for sure

500
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:30,240
and that turns out to be a very

501
00:19:26,159 --> 00:19:30,240
complicated question

502
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:38,520
so okay so we left Abram remember at the

503
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:40,320
end last time he had just gone off to

504
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:42,000
fight a bunch of kings and get his

505
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:44,280
nephew back which seemed to be a pretty

506
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:46,559
courageous act and so that that brought

507
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:48,600
a story to an end and it's interesting I

508
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:51,039
think what happens in The Narrative is

509
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:52,480
that there's a story so Abraham is

510
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,600
somewhere and he goes somewhere else

511
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,640
right that's a story and he has

512
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:57,679
Adventures along the way and those

513
00:19:55,640 --> 00:20:00,000
Adventures are usually the typical kind

514
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:02,400
of Adventure which is a a rift in the

515
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,919
structure of the story an exposure to a

516
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:07,720
kind of chaos and Novelty and then a

517
00:20:04,919 --> 00:20:09,799
reconstitution of the of the mode of

518
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:11,559
being so that's That's a classic story

519
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:13,360
right you are somewhere you're a certain

520
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:14,919
way you're moving forward something

521
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:17,320
happens that you don't expect it blows

522
00:20:14,919 --> 00:20:19,520
you into pieces it introduces chaos

523
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:21,120
right you you face the dragon you get

524
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,520
the gold or maybe the bloody thing eats

525
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,039
you and the story is over and then and

526
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:26,400
then you get to where you're going but

527
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:27,640
then the question is well what happens

528
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,520
when you get to where you're going and

529
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:32,679
that's a really important issue

530
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:34,320
because one of the things that happens

531
00:20:32,679 --> 00:20:36,440
to people all the time in their life is

532
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:38,640
that they get to where they're going and

533
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:40,679
then they don't know what to do right so

534
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:44,720
for example you graduate from University

535
00:20:40,679 --> 00:20:49,080
it's like okay story over who Are You

536
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:50,760
Now who are you the next day and so so

537
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:53,520
what happens is when you succeed then

538
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:55,960
there's a success crisis and the success

539
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:59,400
crisis is well I've run this story to

540
00:20:55,960 --> 00:21:01,440
its end now what and that's exactly what

541
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:04,159
happens in in the abrahamic stories and

542
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:05,960
they're punctuated by a a period of

543
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:09,200
contemplation and sacrifice so every

544
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:12,919
time an abrahamic story comes to its end

545
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:14,400
then Abraham makes another sacrifice and

546
00:21:12,919 --> 00:21:16,600
communes with God and then he figures

547
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:19,440
out what to do next and that seems that

548
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:21,320
seems right it it seems psychologically

549
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,760
right because what you should do when

550
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:24,080
your story comes to an end when you've

551
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:25,960
achieved what it is that you want to

552
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:28,200
achieve or perhaps when you're in

553
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:29,559
terribly Dire Straits but we won't talk

554
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,880
about that at the moment when you've

555
00:21:29,559 --> 00:21:33,159
achieved what you need to achieve then

556
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:36,360
the next question is okay well now I'm

557
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:38,880
that person or I have that character

558
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:40,440
what what do I need to do next and some

559
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,360
of that is always well what do I need to

560
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:44,279
give up now what do I need to let go of

561
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:46,840
so I can move to the next Plateau right

562
00:21:44,279 --> 00:21:49,880
assuming that your life is a hopefully a

563
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:52,080
a sequence of upward moving what would

564
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:53,679
you call them it's like sopus except

565
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:55,440
you're actually each time you climb up

566
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:57,440
the mountain you get a little higher on

567
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:00,919
the mountain it's something like that so

568
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:02,600
it's SI with an optimistic bent and and

569
00:22:00,919 --> 00:22:04,440
and maybe if you push the rock up the

570
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:06,559
mountain properly and let it roll down

571
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:08,520
then and if you do that right then it's

572
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:10,799
okay every time you roll it back up it's

573
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:13,880
it's better in some sense I don't think

574
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:16,919
that's unrealistic either and

575
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:19,919
so Abraham goes and rescues his nephew

576
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:21,240
from this this these T tyrannical Kings

577
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,080
that's very brave and he doesn't take

578
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:24,720
any reward for it because as far as he's

579
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:28,440
concerned it's just a manifestation of

580
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:30,760
the right thing and then he has another

581
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:32,279
Vision after these things that's the

582
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:34,799
battle the word of the Lord came unto

583
00:22:32,279 --> 00:22:36,840
Abram in a vision saying fear not Abram

584
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:39,559
I am thy shield and thy exceeding great

585
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:41,279
reward and Abram said Lord God what will

586
00:22:39,559 --> 00:22:43,400
thou give me seeing I go childless and

587
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:46,320
the steward of my house is this elier of

588
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:48,919
Damascus and Abram said behold to me

589
00:22:46,320 --> 00:22:51,120
thou Hast given no seed and lo no one

590
00:22:48,919 --> 00:22:52,760
born one one born in my house is mine

591
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:55,039
Heir and behold the word of the Lord

592
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:56,760
came to him saying this shall not be

593
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:58,840
thine Heir but he that shall come forth

594
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:01,240
out of th own thine own bowels shall be

595
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:03,440
thine hair and he brought him forth

596
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:05,600
abroad and he said now look to heaven

597
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,840
and tell the Stars if you're able to

598
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:10,880
numble them number them and he said unto

599
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:12,360
him so shall thy seed be and Abram

600
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:14,159
believed in the Lord and he counted it

601
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:16,279
to him for righteousness and he said

602
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:19,159
unto him I am the Lord that brought thee

603
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:21,159
out of er the chelis to give this land

604
00:23:19,159 --> 00:23:23,080
to you to inherit it and he said Lord

605
00:23:21,159 --> 00:23:25,559
God whereby shall I know that I shall

606
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:28,120
inherit it and then he does this

607
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:30,360
sacrifice take me an eer a heer of 3

608
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:32,640
years old and a she goat and a ram and a

609
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:35,120
turtle do and a young pigeon and then

610
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:37,360
God comes down and well Abraham goes

611
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:39,960
into a trance that's what it appears to

612
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:44,799
be in the story um and has a great

613
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:47,279
Terror and then God Appears to him

614
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:49,120
and I'll just review this commentary

615
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:50,720
again this is from Joseph Benson and

616
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:52,159
when the sun was going down that's about

617
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:55,080
the time when you wash up for the

618
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:56,760
evening and he's he's he's praying and

619
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:59,080
waiting towards evening a deep sleep

620
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:00,600
fell upon Abraham not a common sleep

621
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:02,960
through weariness or carelessness but a

622
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:04,520
Divine ecstasy that being wholly taken

623
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:06,320
off from things sensible he might be

624
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:09,720
wholly taken up with a contemplation of

625
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:12,000
things spiritual very strange very very

626
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:13,400
strange series of interpretations

627
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:15,080
because it does seem that what happens

628
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:18,480
to Abraham that he falls into some sort

629
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:21,840
of revelatory trance and so

630
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:23,520
um when as I've taken some pains to

631
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:27,360
explain we don't really understand such

632
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:28,919
things and and we can't rule out their

633
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:31,520
existence because there's too much

634
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:33,159
evidence that they do in fact occur uh

635
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,159
perhaps it's a technology that we no

636
00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:36,960
longer possess that's one possibility

637
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:39,000
perhaps we no longer know how to access

638
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:40,200
these sorts of states of Consciousness

639
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:42,760
it's certainly

640
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:45,399
possible and lo a horror of great

641
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:47,559
Darkness fell upon him this was designed

642
00:24:45,399 --> 00:24:49,399
to strike awe upon the spirit of Abram

643
00:24:47,559 --> 00:24:52,399
and to possess him with holy reverence

644
00:24:49,399 --> 00:24:55,039
holy fear prepares the soul for Holy Joy

645
00:24:52,399 --> 00:24:57,520
God humbles first and then lifts lifts

646
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:59,200
up yeah well I think that's right too

647
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:02,480
like you know one of the experiences

648
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:04,360
I've had in my life fairly commonly in a

649
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,720
variety of different ways this is

650
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:07,880
especially true when I was paying a lot

651
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:09,960
of attention to my dreams which I did

652
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:12,159
for about 15 years I guess something

653
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:14,080
like that now and then I would feel like

654
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:16,360
I'd learned some things and had sort of

655
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:18,559
Consolidated them and then before I went

656
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:21,399
to sleep I'd think okay

657
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:23,200
I'm ready to learn something else it's

658
00:25:21,399 --> 00:25:25,480
like and I didn't say that without

659
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:27,480
trepidation and you because usually when

660
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:30,039
you learn something you know it's not

661
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:32,120
that Pleasant because you usually learn

662
00:25:30,039 --> 00:25:33,960
something about why you're wrong and the

663
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:35,799
deeper the thing that you learn the more

664
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:37,399
you learn about why you're wrong and

665
00:25:35,799 --> 00:25:38,960
there's a death that's associated with

666
00:25:37,399 --> 00:25:42,000
that because then you have to let that

667
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:44,480
part of you that's wrong die and that's

668
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,039
that's that's the sacrifice right and so

669
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:47,520
you have to make a sacrif you have to be

670
00:25:46,039 --> 00:25:50,120
willing to make a sacrifice before

671
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:54,960
you're going to learn something and the

672
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:57,000
and perhaps your what you'll learn is in

673
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:59,600
proportion to your willingness to make a

674
00:25:57,000 --> 00:26:01,480
sacrifice and I really do believe that I

675
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,919
do believe that as well

676
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:07,480
because I also think

677
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:09,200
that if you commit to something that

678
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:11,320
means that you don't do a bunch of other

679
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:13,120
things right so that's the sacrifice of

680
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:15,679
all those other things you commit to it

681
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:17,279
and you set your SS on it if you really

682
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:19,679
commit to it and you get the sacrifice

683
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:21,240
right so to speak then the probability

684
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:23,600
that that thing will be successful

685
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:27,799
vastly increases and I think that that's

686
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:29,600
also not a naive or or a naive way of

687
00:26:27,799 --> 00:26:31,200
thinking or a foolish way of thinking I

688
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:35,120
my experience has been that that's the

689
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:37,200
case and so back to the dream I mean I

690
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:39,679
do think that we learn in trepidation

691
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:43,399
and that most of the time if if you have

692
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:45,480
to be laid low before the new revelation

693
00:26:43,399 --> 00:26:47,039
can make itself manifest and I think

694
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:48,679
that's also what happens to people often

695
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:50,919
in psychedelic experiences when they

696
00:26:48,679 --> 00:26:53,080
have a bad trip is they don't get

697
00:26:50,919 --> 00:26:54,559
through the bad part of it and maybe

698
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:56,640
that's because there's so much mess in

699
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:58,440
their lives now I'm speculating but it's

700
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,640
informed speculation

701
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:02,320
there's so much mess in their lives that

702
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,880
the altered state of consciousness makes

703
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,480
manifest that it's like a little trip

704
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:08,520
through hell and but the mess is so

705
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,960
complete and comprehensive and all

706
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:13,080
pervading that there's no way they can

707
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:14,480
get through it now if they could get

708
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:16,880
through it and started to sort those

709
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:18,960
things out then you know there would be

710
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:21,480
perhaps a what would you call it a

711
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:24,120
compensatory positive Revelation at the

712
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:25,919
end but the first thing is if you want

713
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:28,399
to learn something is that you're going

714
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:31,120
to encounter

715
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:33,279
well you have to figure out what's wrong

716
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:35,480
before you you can figure out what

717
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:38,520
wisdom you need next to guide yourself

718
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:40,880
and that's no laughing matter right and

719
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:43,279
um so I think that that's what it that's

720
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:45,039
what this refers to I think that's the

721
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:48,640
sort of psychological experience that

722
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:50,120
that refers to I also think we built

723
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:52,919
this a little bit into this into the

724
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:55,320
future authoring program you know I read

725
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:57,880
this really cool paper once reviewed by

726
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:59,279
this guy named Jeffrey Gray jeffre gray

727
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:01,440
wrote a book called The neuros pychology

728
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:03,919
of anxiety man and that is a great book

729
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:06,080
it is impossible to read it took me

730
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:08,519
really it took me like 6 months to read

731
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:12,399
it and the reason for that is that he

732
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:15,039
reviewed about 3,000 papers and they

733
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:18,440
were all neurological papers and and and

734
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:20,600
heavy psychological SL biological papers

735
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:22,799
he actually read them all and he

736
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:24,440
understood them and he synthesized them

737
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:27,000
and then he wrote this book about the

738
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:29,240
synthesis and so and he's very very

739
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,919
careful with terminology and so to read

740
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:33,000
the book you have to understand brain

741
00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:35,279
anatomy and you have to understand neuro

742
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:37,760
neuro pharmacology and you have to

743
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:39,360
understand Animal Behavior Uh the whole

744
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:42,559
literature on animal behavior and a

745
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:44,320
whole whopping uh uh dose of human

746
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:47,799
psychology and cybernetics it's like

747
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:49,120
it's a vicious book but you really learn

748
00:28:47,799 --> 00:28:51,519
something when you read it if you go

749
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:53,279
through it bit by bit like and it's it's

750
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:55,360
it's had an overwhelming influence on

751
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:56,960
psychology even among people who haven't

752
00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:00,760
read it which is most of the people who

753
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:02,880
cite it by the way and so but he said he

754
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:04,320
he he outlined this real cool study

755
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,320
maybe it was a sequence of studies about

756
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:09,600
how to motivate rats you know and rats

757
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:12,960
are a lot like us you know in positive

758
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:16,279
and negative ways and uh you know

759
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:17,720
biochemically and and uh psycho

760
00:29:16,279 --> 00:29:19,240
pharmacologically they're very very

761
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:21,720
similar and they have very complex

762
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:23,360
social environments and you know they

763
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:26,120
have hierarchies and they play and they

764
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:27,399
laugh Jack PP Yak PP found out that rats

765
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:28,480
laugh if you tickle them you could

766
00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:30,360
tickle them with like the end of a

767
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,519
pencil eraser but you can't hear them

768
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:34,480
laughing cuz they laugh ultrasonically

769
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:35,720
like bats so you have to record it and

770
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:38,760
then slow it down then you can hear them

771
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:40,559
giggling away when you tickle them so so

772
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:43,559
which is you know you think oh going to

773
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:45,360
spend $50,000 on a study demonstrating

774
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:47,000
that rats laugh and you think well wait

775
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:48,159
a second wait a second that's a major

776
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,000
league study you know because he's

777
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:53,120
outlined a a ludic circuit that's a play

778
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:55,080
circuit and Yak panks have discovered

779
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:57,519
the play circuit in mammals that's a

780
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:59,240
bloody big deal you know if you get that

781
00:29:57,519 --> 00:30:03,799
by like rubbing rats with a pencil

782
00:29:59,240 --> 00:30:05,559
eraser Well good for you so anyways so

783
00:30:03,799 --> 00:30:08,919
gray talked a lot about how to motivate

784
00:30:05,559 --> 00:30:10,799
a a rat and you might have heard about

785
00:30:08,919 --> 00:30:12,440
BF Skinner you know he used food pellets

786
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:13,960
to motivate his rats but what you don't

787
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:16,120
know about Skinner is that those rats

788
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:18,960
were starved to three4 of their normal

789
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:22,320
body weight so they would they would

790
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:24,640
work for food man so skinners rats were

791
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:26,200
kind of oversimplified but you can get

792
00:30:24,640 --> 00:30:27,519
rats to work for food they don't have to

793
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,679
be that hungry you can get them to work

794
00:30:27,519 --> 00:30:30,679
for food and they'll do all sorts of

795
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:33,559
things they'll press levers and and

796
00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:35,600
they'll open bar open doors and they'll

797
00:30:33,559 --> 00:30:37,559
solve problems and you know they'll do

798
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:39,919
all sorts of things and one of the

799
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:41,559
things you can do to kind of measure how

800
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:42,799
much the rat is motivated is let's say

801
00:30:41,559 --> 00:30:44,600
you've run him through a maze and he

802
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:47,360
knows there's some food at the end of

803
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:49,440
the maze you can tie a little spring to

804
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:51,399
his tail and see how hard he pulls when

805
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,279
you open the door to the maze so that's

806
00:30:51,399 --> 00:30:55,039
because that's how much rat work the rat

807
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:56,720
is willing to do so you can measure that

808
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:58,840
or you can see how fast he skitters down

809
00:30:56,720 --> 00:31:01,399
the maze and you can get an estimate

810
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:03,919
about the rat's motivation and so then

811
00:31:01,399 --> 00:31:06,240
you might say well how motivated is a

812
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:07,799
hungry rat and the answer would be

813
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:10,720
depends on how hungry he is but there's

814
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:12,360
another answer it also depends on what's

815
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:15,639
chasing him when he's going after the

816
00:31:12,360 --> 00:31:18,279
food so if you have a rat and you you

817
00:31:15,639 --> 00:31:21,320
have food over here and you waft in some

818
00:31:18,279 --> 00:31:23,559
cat odor rats hate cat odor and it's

819
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:26,279
innate they never have to see or smell a

820
00:31:23,559 --> 00:31:29,399
cat to be absolutely petrified by cat

821
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:31,120
odor so if you waft in some cat odor and

822
00:31:29,399 --> 00:31:32,720
then open the door that rat will Zoom to

823
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:35,399
that food a lot faster than it will if

824
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:37,240
it's just hungry so a rat running away

825
00:31:35,399 --> 00:31:39,159
from something that it doesn't want

826
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:42,120
towards something that it does want is a

827
00:31:39,159 --> 00:31:43,720
very motivated rat and so one of the

828
00:31:42,120 --> 00:31:45,639
things we did with the future authoring

829
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:47,320
program that's gerain to this idea of

830
00:31:45,639 --> 00:31:48,760
Terror because there's there's this idea

831
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:50,559
in the Old Testament that the fear of

832
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:53,679
God is the beginning of wisdom and it's

833
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:55,480
a pretty harsh idea but but there's

834
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:56,799
something really useful about it because

835
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:58,960
one of the things you see with people

836
00:31:56,799 --> 00:32:00,720
all the time time is that they're maybe

837
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:03,960
they're trying to stumble forward

838
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:06,120
towards their ideal as poorly defined as

839
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:07,360
it might be but then they're afraid

840
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:09,480
right they're afraid about what they

841
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:11,320
might encounter and that stops them

842
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:13,440
because fear does stop people it freezes

843
00:32:11,320 --> 00:32:14,919
you like a prey animal and so people

844
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:18,159
move ahead but then they get afraid and

845
00:32:14,919 --> 00:32:19,559
then they stop moving ahead and so and

846
00:32:18,159 --> 00:32:21,399
that's not so good because negative

847
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:23,080
emotion is a really powerful motivator

848
00:32:21,399 --> 00:32:24,840
so we're more motivated by negative

849
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:27,080
emotion than positive emotion

850
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:28,799
quantitatively speaking quantitative

851
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:30,480
quantitatively speaking you can measure

852
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:32,360
that and that's I think because we can

853
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:34,840
only be so happy but we can really be

854
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:36,760
suffering and dead you know so we have

855
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:38,240
to pay more attention to the negative

856
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:39,960
and that's bad because the negative can

857
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:43,200
stop you and then in my clinical

858
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:44,679
practice you know I often talk to people

859
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,039
who are trying to make a difficult life

860
00:32:44,679 --> 00:32:48,919
decision and and they they're weighing

861
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:50,519
out the costs and the benefits of making

862
00:32:48,919 --> 00:32:52,159
the life decision you know and one of

863
00:32:50,519 --> 00:32:54,440
the things I always talk to them about

864
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:56,360
is wait a second that's an incomplete

865
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:59,240
analysis you have to weigh out the

866
00:32:56,360 --> 00:33:00,600
benefits and the costs of doing this and

867
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:03,000
you have to weigh out the costs and

868
00:33:00,600 --> 00:33:05,320
benefits of not doing that not doing it

869
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:07,039
and that's not the same as the zero that

870
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:10,000
you assume that you're starting with

871
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:12,360
right because to not make a decision

872
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:14,440
also has a cost and sometimes the cost

873
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:16,440
of not making a decision is far worse

874
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:18,720
than the cost of making a decision even

875
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:20,120
if the decision is risky and so one of

876
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,919
the things you can derive from that and

877
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:25,320
this is very useful I think is

878
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:27,679
that this is also I think why it's so

879
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:29,840
useful to contemplate your mortal so to

880
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:32,600
speak is you're screwed no matter what

881
00:33:29,840 --> 00:33:35,320
you do you know and that actually frees

882
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:37,000
you is that you you you have path a that

883
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:38,639
has catastrophes and you have path B

884
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:41,000
that has catastrophes and you don't get

885
00:33:38,639 --> 00:33:43,279
to have the no catastrophe path but you

886
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,679
get to pick which one and that's really

887
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:47,799
something because if you know that

888
00:33:44,679 --> 00:33:49,440
there's terrible risk associated with

889
00:33:47,799 --> 00:33:50,799
everything that you do and don't do then

890
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,679
you can afford to take some risks

891
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:55,480
because you're not you know and this is

892
00:33:52,679 --> 00:33:57,799
all within the arc metaphor I'm still

893
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:59,480
making the case that despite the fact

894
00:33:57,799 --> 00:34:01,720
that your life is essentially

895
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:03,519
catastrophic you can you can make a

896
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:05,399
covenant with the highest ideal and that

897
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:07,280
will take you through it the best way

898
00:34:05,399 --> 00:34:10,280
possible I'm I'm I'm still making that

899
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:10,280
case

900
00:34:10,359 --> 00:34:13,839
so so then you think okay well I'm

901
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:15,599
trying to make this decision I'm going

902
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:17,280
to go try to do something difficult and

903
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:19,440
isn't that terrifying and then you think

904
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:22,359
yeah but wait a minute what's really

905
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:24,879
terrifying is not doing it and then you

906
00:34:22,359 --> 00:34:26,480
think about the cost of not doing it so

907
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:28,200
in the future authoring program we have

908
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:30,359
people do this little meditative

909
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:32,639
exercise which is okay just think about

910
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:34,639
your insufficiencies by your own

911
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:37,760
definition right the way that you don't

912
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:39,520
do what you know you should do about the

913
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,280
things that you do that you shouldn't do

914
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,960
that you know you shouldn't do beyond a

915
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:45,079
shadow of a doubt right there's some

916
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:47,399
things like that and that that's bad

917
00:34:45,079 --> 00:34:49,800
habits and and poor aim and all of the

918
00:34:47,399 --> 00:34:51,520
resentment and hatred and aggression and

919
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:53,560
unresolved conflicts and all those

920
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:55,399
things that are dementing you and

921
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:56,879
warping you and then think okay those

922
00:34:55,399 --> 00:34:58,599
things get the upper hand man they get

923
00:34:56,879 --> 00:35:00,760
get the upper hand and they take you the

924
00:34:58,599 --> 00:35:03,160
worst possible place you could go in the

925
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:05,720
next 3 to 5 years what exactly does that

926
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:06,920
look like and so you sketch all that out

927
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:08,640
and you think hey I don't want to go

928
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:10,720
there and so the next time that a

929
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,960
Temptation comes up you think well it'd

930
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,520
be a lot better for me if I didn't

931
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:15,560
succumb to this temptation it's like

932
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:17,119
that's kind of weak hey you'd look a

933
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:19,200
little better if you didn't eat like a

934
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:20,960
cheesecake a day or something like that

935
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:23,560
you know that's that's something but

936
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:25,560
it's not the same as um I'm going to

937
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:28,160
have diabetes and I'm going to lose my

938
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:30,520
damn leg in in 5 years if I don't get my

939
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:32,000
eating under control that's motivating

940
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:36,800
and so then the Temptation comes along

941
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:40,119
and you think oh how about no seriously

942
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:42,119
how about no not just because a a higher

943
00:35:40,119 --> 00:35:44,960
good would be obtained if I avoided it

944
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:48,119
but because a a terrible catastrophe

945
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:50,520
would be averted if I didn't and so well

946
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:52,040
so you want to get your fear behind you

947
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:53,480
right you want to get it behind you

948
00:35:52,040 --> 00:35:54,880
where it's pushing you forward instead

949
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:56,920
of in front of you where it's stopping

950
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:59,440
you and you get your fear behind you

951
00:35:56,920 --> 00:36:01,760
pushing your for you forward by actually

952
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:03,480
thinking through the consequences of not

953
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:05,599
putting your life together and the least

954
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:06,720
of those is that you waste it and suffer

955
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:10,000
right because you're going to suffer

956
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:12,319
anyways man so you waste it and suffer

957
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,400
that's a bad deal because maybe if

958
00:36:12,319 --> 00:36:15,319
you're going to suffer you could at

959
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:18,119
least do something Noble and glorious

960
00:36:15,319 --> 00:36:20,720
and upright and powerful and honorable

961
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:23,079
and admirable and helpful and and

962
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:24,720
difficult you know that's just so much

963
00:36:23,079 --> 00:36:26,760
better and maybe that's good enough so

964
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:29,240
that you think hey you know little

965
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:32,000
offering it's basically worth it at

966
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:34,760
least it's a way forward you know at

967
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,760
least it's a way

968
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:39,839
forward and he said unto Abram know of

969
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,800
assurity that thy seed shall be a

970
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:44,000
stranger in a land that is not theirs

971
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:46,160
and Shall Serve those people and they'll

972
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,920
afflick them for 400 years God he's

973
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:49,960
hedging his bets here a lot right he

974
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:51,520
says to Abraham well go out you know

975
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,920
into the world and then he confronts him

976
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:54,800
with a famine and he confronts him with

977
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:56,839
a tyan and with powerful people he wants

978
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,680
to take his wife and then he loses is

979
00:36:56,839 --> 00:37:01,240
his nephew and who he has a fight with

980
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:03,280
then he has to go fight a war and now

981
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:04,680
you know he's reconstituting this

982
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:06,400
Covenant and God says yeah you're going

983
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:09,079
to

984
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:10,800
have a nation is going to come from you

985
00:37:09,079 --> 00:37:14,119
but they're going to be slaves to

986
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:17,240
tyrants for like 400 years it's

987
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:19,640
like he's not a great salesman exactly

988
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:21,240
but but the thing about it is that the

989
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:23,720
thing that I like about it is that it's

990
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:27,839
realistic you know and you got to think

991
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:30,359
too because who knows why is that the

992
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:32,359
Bible exists or why people wrote it but

993
00:37:30,359 --> 00:37:34,160
you know if they're going to sell you

994
00:37:32,359 --> 00:37:36,800
something I don't know if this is the

995
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:38,720
way to do it you know because unless

996
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:40,280
you're a Salesman who's sophisticated

997
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:41,880
beyond belief because you'd think that

998
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:43,880
if it was just a matter of controlling

999
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:46,359
the masses let's say which is one say

1000
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:48,680
Marxist interpretation of religion or or

1001
00:37:46,359 --> 00:37:50,720
providing people with a primitive

1002
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:52,400
defense against death anxiety which is

1003
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:54,119
essentially the Freudian interpretation

1004
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:55,880
that you'd kind of make the deals that

1005
00:37:54,119 --> 00:37:58,079
God cut with Abraham a little more on

1006
00:37:55,880 --> 00:38:00,560
the positive and Polished side instead

1007
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:02,880
of making them a realistic offer

1008
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:04,760
constantly like they are that that's

1009
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:06,280
also that's that that's part of the

1010
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:08,400
reason I think it is reasonable to treat

1011
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:09,880
the Bible as literature it's it's more

1012
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,720
than literature it's something other

1013
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:13,079
than literature but you can treat it as

1014
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:14,440
literature and I think the reason that

1015
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:16,560
you can treat it as literature is

1016
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:18,520
because the characters are all complex

1017
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:20,839
including the character of of God

1018
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:24,040
himself is complex and sophisticated

1019
00:38:20,839 --> 00:38:26,200
it's not one-sided and it's it's

1020
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:28,119
paradoxical and incomprehensible at

1021
00:38:26,200 --> 00:38:30,000
times but I think good literature is

1022
00:38:28,119 --> 00:38:31,480
like that because you know true Art

1023
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:33,640
here's something about true art this is

1024
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:36,960
something I learned from Yung it's so

1025
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:39,760
smart he was so smart so imagine that

1026
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:41,480
you inhabit the land that you know

1027
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:43,400
conceptually and practically and then

1028
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:45,200
imagine outside of that there's that

1029
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,920
massive space of things that you don't

1030
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:49,119
know and even outside of that there's

1031
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:51,000
the space of things that no one knows

1032
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:52,400
right so it's the known territory

1033
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:54,720
surrounded by the unknown that's the

1034
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:57,400
canonical archetypal landscape and the

1035
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:58,800
unknown manifests it itself to you and

1036
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,079
that's where new knowledge comes from

1037
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:02,560
but the question is how is that

1038
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:05,079
knowledge generated and it doesn't just

1039
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:07,640
leap from completely unknown to

1040
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:09,400
completely articulate in one move that

1041
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:12,720
isn't how it happens it has to pass

1042
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:14,839
through stages of analysis before it

1043
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,599
becomes articulable and the first stage

1044
00:39:14,839 --> 00:39:18,319
of analysis as far as I can tell is that

1045
00:39:16,599 --> 00:39:20,680
you act it out so if something really

1046
00:39:18,319 --> 00:39:22,400
surprises you the first way that you

1047
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:24,680
react to it your category is actually

1048
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:27,119
embodied you like this that that's your

1049
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:29,560
first category it's not ceptual at all

1050
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:32,640
it's embodied and then maybe you start

1051
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:33,960
to like you're at home at night and you

1052
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:36,040
know something startles you and you

1053
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:38,119
freeze and then it's dark and then your

1054
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:40,160
imagination populates the darkness with

1055
00:39:38,119 --> 00:39:41,760
whatever might be making the noise and

1056
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:44,560
that's the sequence it's like embodied

1057
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:47,480
response imaginative representation

1058
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:49,079
exploration articulation that's how

1059
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:51,319
information moves from the unknown to

1060
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:54,079
the known and and artists are the people

1061
00:39:51,319 --> 00:39:55,520
who stand on that imagistic Frontier and

1062
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:58,000
they and they put themselves out into

1063
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:59,560
the unknown and they and they they take

1064
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,079
a piece of it and they and they

1065
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:03,560
transform it into some mythological

1066
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:05,040
image and they don't know what they're

1067
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:06,680
doing exactly because they're Guided by

1068
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:08,560
their intuition if they're real artists

1069
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:10,160
otherwise they're just propagandists

1070
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:12,040
they have to be contending with

1071
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:13,880
something that they don't understand and

1072
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:15,880
what they do is they make it more

1073
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:17,920
understandable you know and and then

1074
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:19,520
people gaze at those artworks or or they

1075
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:21,000
listen to the stories and then they

1076
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:24,119
start to become informed by them but

1077
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:26,599
they don't know how or why I was at the

1078
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:28,480
modern art museum museum of art and in

1079
00:40:26,599 --> 00:40:31,359
New York I'm afraid I don't remember

1080
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:34,960
which one unfortunately but it I was in

1081
00:40:31,359 --> 00:40:37,960
this amazing room you know it had all

1082
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:40,160
these Priceless paintings from the from

1083
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:41,960
the late Renaissance hanging in it you

1084
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:43,720
know each painting worth who knows a

1085
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:47,119
billion dollars maybe the Priceless

1086
00:40:43,720 --> 00:40:48,720
painting so the room was it's a shrine

1087
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:50,200
and it was full of people from all over

1088
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:51,280
the world who were looking at these

1089
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,680
paintings you think well what the hell

1090
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:54,160
are these people doing coming to this

1091
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:55,760
room looking at these paintings like

1092
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:58,760
what what are they up to one of them was

1093
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:00,839
a of the Assumption of Mary right

1094
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:02,560
brilliantly composed and there was all

1095
00:41:00,839 --> 00:41:04,200
these people looking at it and I thought

1096
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:05,800
what are they doing they don't know what

1097
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:07,400
that means like why are they looking at

1098
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:09,280
that painting why is it in this room why

1099
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:11,079
does it cost a billion dollars why is

1100
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:12,599
that painting worth so much and the

1101
00:41:11,079 --> 00:41:15,000
answer to that is well we don't really

1102
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:17,520
know like it happened they're they're

1103
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:19,839
sacred objects in some sense and we gaze

1104
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:21,400
at them in ignorance and wonder and the

1105
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:23,480
reason for that is that the unknown

1106
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:28,240
shines through the Mattis and in

1107
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:28,240
partially articulated form and so

1108
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:39,440
well that's the role of

1109
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:42,359
Art and that's the role of artists you

1110
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:45,000
know

1111
00:41:42,359 --> 00:41:46,880
and real artists real artists are

1112
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:48,599
contending with the unknown right and

1113
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:50,520
they're possessed by it they have a

1114
00:41:48,599 --> 00:41:52,480
personality trait openness that makes

1115
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:54,119
them do that they can't even help it and

1116
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:56,520
I've had lots of creative people in my

1117
00:41:54,119 --> 00:41:58,560
clinical practice and I can tell you the

1118
00:41:56,520 --> 00:42:00,920
worst thing for Creative people is to

1119
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:03,760
not be creative because they just die

1120
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:06,839
and it because it's it's it's it's like

1121
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:09,040
maybe you're a tree with a few major

1122
00:42:06,839 --> 00:42:10,760
branches you know that's your

1123
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:12,319
personality so if you're extroverted man

1124
00:42:10,760 --> 00:42:14,880
you can't be cut off from people because

1125
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:16,040
you just wither and if you're agreeable

1126
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:18,079
you have to be in an intimate

1127
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:19,599
relationship or you die you know and if

1128
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:21,319
you're conscientious man and you and

1129
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:22,960
you're unemployed you're just going to

1130
00:42:21,319 --> 00:42:24,680
eat yourself up because you have to have

1131
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,880
a duty and you have to carry a load

1132
00:42:24,680 --> 00:42:28,040
because you just can't stand it

1133
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:29,880
otherwise and open people have to be

1134
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:32,000
creative they have to be because

1135
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:35,240
otherwise they die they don't have any

1136
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:37,400
vitality and so they're cursed with the

1137
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:39,319
necessity of putting a foot out into the

1138
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:40,960
unknown and making sense of it and then

1139
00:42:39,319 --> 00:42:42,319
they're also cursed with the necessity

1140
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:44,000
of trying to make a living while they're

1141
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:46,119
doing that which they can't because you

1142
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,839
can't it's almost impossible to monetize

1143
00:42:46,119 --> 00:42:50,839
creative creative action as many of you

1144
00:42:48,839 --> 00:42:52,960
who are creative will no doubt find out

1145
00:42:50,839 --> 00:42:55,319
it's very very frustrating it's not that

1146
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:56,760
creative action is without value right

1147
00:42:55,319 --> 00:42:58,200
because the creative people are

1148
00:42:56,760 --> 00:43:00,200
entrepreneurs and the creative people

1149
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:02,079
Revitalize cities and the creative

1150
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:03,240
people make things magnificent and

1151
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:04,760
beautiful you think about what's

1152
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:07,440
happened in Europe over the last

1153
00:43:04,760 --> 00:43:11,359
Thousand Years say 2,000 years this

1154
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:13,520
amazing unbelievable collaboration to

1155
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:15,480
make things so beautiful that they're

1156
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:17,160
they're jaw-dropping when you walk into

1157
00:43:15,480 --> 00:43:19,240
them and you think about the economic

1158
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:20,880
value of that right I mean I think it's

1159
00:43:19,240 --> 00:43:22,440
it's either France or Spain that's the

1160
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,599
most visited country in the world it's

1161
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:25,400
one of those two I think there's more

1162
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:27,160
tourists in France than there are people

1163
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:29,040
most of the time and part of the reason

1164
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:31,200
for that is it's just so damn beautiful

1165
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:33,720
you just can't stand it and you think

1166
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:36,240
what's the economic value of that it's

1167
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:38,440
absolutely incalculable and what's

1168
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:40,839
interesting too is that you build that

1169
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:43,760
beauty in and then the farther away you

1170
00:43:40,839 --> 00:43:45,839
get from it in time the more valuable it

1171
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:48,160
becomes right instead of decaying it has

1172
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:50,200
exactly the opposite effect its value

1173
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:52,720
magnifies and one of the things that I'm

1174
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:54,960
deeply ashamed of as a Canadian is that

1175
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:57,920
our sense of beauty is so underdeveloped

1176
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:59,640
we're so primitive it's not even

1177
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,760
primitive that's the wrong word because

1178
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:04,800
you

1179
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:06,800
know I don't know what it is it's it's

1180
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:08,800
it's second rate it's second rate at

1181
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:11,240
least it's Terror too because people are

1182
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:13,599
afraid of beauty but the idea that art

1183
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:15,119
is the conservatives really have a

1184
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:16,800
problem with this in particular because

1185
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:19,240
conservative people tend not to be that

1186
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:21,720
creative and it it's a Myster Myst by

1187
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:23,400
temperament it it's a mystery to me

1188
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:25,400
because they should be concerned with

1189
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:27,240
economic development and beauty is so

1190
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:29,160
unbelievable crucial to Economic

1191
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:32,079
Development it just yells out at you you

1192
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:33,400
know so anyway so that's what artists

1193
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:35,440
are doing and so one of the things I

1194
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:37,559
would say is buy a damn piece of art you

1195
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:39,319
know find one that really speaks to you

1196
00:44:37,559 --> 00:44:41,200
and and buy a piece of art because you

1197
00:44:39,319 --> 00:44:44,119
invite that into your life and it's it's

1198
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:45,680
a look out if you do it if it's a real

1199
00:44:44,119 --> 00:44:47,119
piece of art because you'll also get a

1200
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:48,720
you know a little introduction to the

1201
00:44:47,119 --> 00:44:51,359
artist and then that'll seep into your

1202
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:53,400
life and that'll change things like mad

1203
00:44:51,359 --> 00:44:56,480
but it's really it's unbelievably worth

1204
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:58,240
it because it it opens your eyes to the

1205
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:59,800
domain of the Transcendent that's the

1206
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:02,599
right way of thinking about a real piece

1207
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:04,400
of art is a window into the Transcendent

1208
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:06,119
that's what it is and you need that in

1209
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:08,800
your life because you're finite and

1210
00:45:06,119 --> 00:45:10,480
limited and bounded right by your

1211
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:12,599
ignorance and your lack of knowing and

1212
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:14,160
unless you can make a connection to the

1213
00:45:12,599 --> 00:45:16,040
Transcendent then you don't have the

1214
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:18,200
strength to Prevail and that's part of

1215
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:20,359
the Covenant that's part of the Covenant

1216
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:22,760
with God and you can see that because

1217
00:45:20,359 --> 00:45:24,960
you look at these magnificent Cathedrals

1218
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:26,720
that our civilization built over the

1219
00:45:24,960 --> 00:45:29,920
centuries you know some those they're

1220
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:33,040
still bu building the sangria familia in

1221
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:34,359
in in uh Barcelona right and it's an

1222
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:36,920
amazing building I think it's going to

1223
00:45:34,359 --> 00:45:38,440
take them like 300 years to build that

1224
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:39,920
you know people in the Middle Ages

1225
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:41,960
they'd start building a cathedral and

1226
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:44,119
they' think oh we'll be done this in 300

1227
00:45:41,960 --> 00:45:46,040
years you know you imagine the vision

1228
00:45:44,119 --> 00:45:48,839
that it took to invest in something like

1229
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:51,119
that we we look at quarterly reports we

1230
00:45:48,839 --> 00:45:53,440
can't think 300 years into the future to

1231
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:56,240
build something of that kind of

1232
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:57,920
remarkable remarkable what those

1233
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:59,800
Cathedrals are so they're they're

1234
00:45:57,920 --> 00:46:01,160
perfect they're trees first right

1235
00:45:59,800 --> 00:46:02,720
they're a forest right the gothic

1236
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:04,839
Cathedrals they're they're a forest and

1237
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:06,720
the sun is shining through the branches

1238
00:46:04,839 --> 00:46:09,000
that's the stained glass and they're the

1239
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:10,839
perfect balance of light and structure

1240
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:12,559
because they're representing something

1241
00:46:10,839 --> 00:46:14,520
about the proper structure of being

1242
00:46:12,559 --> 00:46:16,880
which is something like the proper

1243
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:19,599
balance between light and structure and

1244
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:21,720
and they represent like the sacred

1245
00:46:19,599 --> 00:46:23,880
tragedy of mankind that's why they're in

1246
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:26,040
the shape of a cross and they're open to

1247
00:46:23,880 --> 00:46:28,319
the sky that's why they have a dome and

1248
00:46:26,040 --> 00:46:30,079
they're full of gold so that it Glitters

1249
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:35,359
because that's like the city of God you

1250
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:37,920
know and and and you you can see that

1251
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:40,920
that integral to to our culture is the

1252
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:43,200
idea that beauty is one pathway towards

1253
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:44,960
God and it's and it's and if you can't

1254
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:47,160
find another pathway then why don't you

1255
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:48,960
use Beauty sure most of you do that with

1256
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:50,559
music because music is the one thing

1257
00:46:48,960 --> 00:46:53,119
that modern people can't be cynical

1258
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:55,119
about thank God for that and being

1259
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:57,400
fascinated by music because of that it

1260
00:46:55,119 --> 00:46:59,960
it speaks meaning to people right even

1261
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:01,559
nihilistic Punk Rockers are so damn

1262
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:03,480
engaged with their music that they can

1263
00:47:01,559 --> 00:47:05,280
hardly stand it and you can knock on

1264
00:47:03,480 --> 00:47:07,280
them and say look you know you're having

1265
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,880
a Transcendent religious experience and

1266
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:11,200
they'll just tell you to [ __ ] off

1267
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:11,200
because

1268
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:19,880
[Applause]

1269
00:47:17,640 --> 00:47:21,839
that's because that's that's what punk

1270
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:24,240
rockers have to do

1271
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:26,079
but but that's still what's happening

1272
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:29,920
you know I mean it's still what's

1273
00:47:26,079 --> 00:47:32,720
happening so okay

1274
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:35,000
so okay so I I got into all that because

1275
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:36,640
I was talking about about the Bible as

1276
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:40,119
literature you know and and and trying

1277
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:43,960
to and trying to lay out because we we

1278
00:47:40,119 --> 00:47:45,520
need in our culture to justify the Arts

1279
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:48,119
and you have to I don't want to do that

1280
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:50,119
by talking about high culture talking

1281
00:47:48,119 --> 00:47:51,880
about something abstract and event

1282
00:47:50,119 --> 00:47:54,599
that's the wrong way to go about it this

1283
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:55,839
is vital you know like one of the things

1284
00:47:54,599 --> 00:47:58,400
that's really interesting about the

1285
00:47:55,839 --> 00:48:00,920
University of Toronto is that the the

1286
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:03,520
one side of the campus where we are is

1287
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:07,280
beautiful medieval Cathedral and the

1288
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:10,680
other side is God awful Factory and you

1289
00:48:07,280 --> 00:48:12,839
know and and that and the thing is the

1290
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:14,839
attitude towards knowledge has

1291
00:48:12,839 --> 00:48:17,240
paralleled that architectural

1292
00:48:14,839 --> 00:48:19,040
transformation you know at one point the

1293
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:21,599
humanities let's say were a sacred

1294
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:23,079
Endeavor and and so was the art of Being

1295
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:26,040
educated in the university and that's

1296
00:48:23,079 --> 00:48:27,800
turned into like mass factory and that's

1297
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:30,040
reflected in the architecture this isn't

1298
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:32,559
accidental none of this happens none of

1299
00:48:30,040 --> 00:48:34,160
this happens by random chance you know

1300
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:36,319
it's not like there's a conspiracy or

1301
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:37,480
anything because there isn't but that

1302
00:48:36,319 --> 00:48:39,440
doesn't mean that these things aren't

1303
00:48:37,480 --> 00:48:41,720
Tangled together and the loss of Beauty

1304
00:48:39,440 --> 00:48:44,720
in the universities is a catastrophe

1305
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:47,319
because without that beauty there's no

1306
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:49,760
call to higher being you know you this

1307
00:48:47,319 --> 00:48:51,040
is also why you know i' I've mentioned

1308
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:52,960
to people that they should clean up

1309
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:54,799
their rooms that's become quite the

1310
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:56,319
internet meme but I'm really serious

1311
00:48:54,799 --> 00:48:57,960
about it CU it's really hard to do that

1312
00:48:56,319 --> 00:49:00,319
and I've been cleaning up my room by the

1313
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:02,240
way for about 4 months now because my

1314
00:49:00,319 --> 00:49:04,640
life was thrown into such a catastrophe

1315
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:06,839
and and also we were renovating and so

1316
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:09,480
but it isn't just that you clean it up

1317
00:49:06,839 --> 00:49:11,720
you also make it beautiful and be it's

1318
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:13,079
really hard to make something beautiful

1319
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:14,359
and it's really worthwhile and what's

1320
00:49:13,079 --> 00:49:16,000
really cool is if you learn to make

1321
00:49:14,359 --> 00:49:18,280
something beautiful even one thing if

1322
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:19,960
you can just make one thing in your life

1323
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:21,640
beautiful then you've establish a

1324
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:24,319
relationship with beauty and then you

1325
00:49:21,640 --> 00:49:26,839
can start to expand that relationship

1326
00:49:24,319 --> 00:49:28,440
with beauty out into into the world like

1327
00:49:26,839 --> 00:49:30,520
into other elements of your life and

1328
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:33,319
that is so worthwhile it's just

1329
00:49:30,520 --> 00:49:35,400
incredibly crazily worthwhile and that's

1330
00:49:33,319 --> 00:49:37,280
an invitation to the Divine you know you

1331
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:39,079
have to be daring to do that and people

1332
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:41,240
are terrified of it people are terrified

1333
00:49:39,079 --> 00:49:43,319
of color they paint their walls beige

1334
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:44,760
they're terrified of art they buy some

1335
00:49:43,319 --> 00:49:46,760
mass-produced thing because they don't

1336
00:49:44,760 --> 00:49:48,640
want anybody laughing at them for their

1337
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:50,520
lack of taste and they would get laughed

1338
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:52,359
at because they have no taste but you

1339
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:54,359
have to well it's right because what do

1340
00:49:52,359 --> 00:49:55,720
you know right you have to develop it

1341
00:49:54,359 --> 00:49:57,520
and so you're going to stumble along and

1342
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:58,960
make mistakes to begin with and you're

1343
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:00,720
going to show yourself because if you

1344
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:02,599
buy oh I think this is pretty and you

1345
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:04,520
know somebody comes over and goes what's

1346
00:50:02,599 --> 00:50:06,880
up with you it's kind of hard on your

1347
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:09,400
self-esteem but but it's a St you're

1348
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:12,880
stumbling towards the right you're

1349
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:14,079
stumbling towards the kingdom of God

1350
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:15,480
that's what you're stumbling towards

1351
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:17,040
when you try to make an aesthetic

1352
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:18,240
decision and to put something in your

1353
00:50:17,040 --> 00:50:21,040
life that's beautiful and it's

1354
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:22,640
unbelievably worthwhile to do that and

1355
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:24,480
you have to steer clear of the frauds

1356
00:50:22,640 --> 00:50:26,640
and the con artists and all of that and

1357
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:28,280
art is full of that of course because

1358
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:30,480
it's difficult to distinguish between

1359
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:32,680
the real thing and the fraud but but

1360
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:35,000
it's unbelievably worthwhile and so back

1361
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:36,640
to literature I'm I'm I'm telling you

1362
00:50:35,000 --> 00:50:39,960
this partly because I've been thinking a

1363
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:39,960
lot about the humanities and the

1364
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:45,599
Arts and practically speaking because I

1365
00:50:43,559 --> 00:50:47,000
know that artistic types are also

1366
00:50:45,599 --> 00:50:49,240
entrepreneurial types they're the same

1367
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:51,200
personality types and so it's very much

1368
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:53,760
worthwhile to make an economic and

1369
00:50:51,200 --> 00:50:55,640
practical case for this sort of thing

1370
00:50:53,760 --> 00:50:58,000
you study literature in the humanity so

1371
00:50:55,640 --> 00:51:00,160
that you can familiarize yourself with

1372
00:50:58,000 --> 00:51:01,520
the wisdom of our civilization man you

1373
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:03,400
should do that because people have been

1374
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:06,040
working on this thing for a long time

1375
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:07,359
and it's Rich Beyond comparison so why

1376
00:51:06,040 --> 00:51:10,000
wouldn't you do that and you teach

1377
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:12,040
yourself to to read and you teach

1378
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:13,440
yourself to speak and you teach yourself

1379
00:51:12,040 --> 00:51:15,680
to think and you teach yourself to

1380
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:19,280
communicate and I can tell you if you

1381
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:22,799
can read and think and and communicate

1382
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:24,640
you are absolutely 100%

1383
00:51:22,799 --> 00:51:26,240
Unstoppable and that's another thing

1384
00:51:24,640 --> 00:51:27,480
that's so interesting about Humanities

1385
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:29,079
education that's at the core of the

1386
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:30,799
University it's like there's nothing

1387
00:51:29,079 --> 00:51:32,520
more economically valuable than teaching

1388
00:51:30,799 --> 00:51:34,599
people how to articulate themselves and

1389
00:51:32,520 --> 00:51:36,240
communicate because they can identify

1390
00:51:34,599 --> 00:51:38,240
problems they can formulate solutions

1391
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:39,760
they can negotiate to consensus they

1392
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:42,160
they can negotiate on their own behalf

1393
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:45,000
or on the behalf of others it's like

1394
00:51:42,160 --> 00:51:46,799
there's absolutely no downside to it

1395
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:49,079
except that there's responsibility that

1396
00:51:46,799 --> 00:51:51,480
goes along with it but it doesn't matter

1397
00:51:49,079 --> 00:51:53,319
because there's no escape from

1398
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:54,520
responsibility you can either take it

1399
00:51:53,319 --> 00:51:55,680
voluntarily or you can take it

1400
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:57,160
involuntarily those those are your

1401
00:51:55,680 --> 00:51:59,640
options but there aren't any other

1402
00:51:57,160 --> 00:52:01,640
options and so we need to understand the

1403
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:03,400
role of art and literature and and stop

1404
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:05,880
thinking about it as an option it's not

1405
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:08,319
an option it's not an option what is it

1406
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:10,839
said man does not live by bread alone

1407
00:52:08,319 --> 00:52:13,319
that's exactly right we live by Beauty

1408
00:52:10,839 --> 00:52:15,799
we live by literature we live by Art and

1409
00:52:13,319 --> 00:52:17,599
literally not metaphorically we cannot

1410
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:20,599
live without it because life is too

1411
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:24,400
dismal and and and tragic in the absence

1412
00:52:20,599 --> 00:52:26,520
of the sublime so and ourselves we have

1413
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:28,280
to be Sharp so that we can survive

1414
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:30,520
properly and Orient the world properly

1415
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:32,720
and not destroy things including

1416
00:52:30,520 --> 00:52:35,319
ourselves and

1417
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:37,680
so and so back to the Bible which I do

1418
00:52:35,319 --> 00:52:39,079
think is a reasonable it's reasonably

1419
00:52:37,680 --> 00:52:40,880
construed as a piece of literature

1420
00:52:39,079 --> 00:52:42,880
because it's deep and because the people

1421
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:44,640
who wrote it had at least one foot in

1422
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:47,119
the unknowable and they're trying to

1423
00:52:44,640 --> 00:52:49,760
communicate what they experienced in the

1424
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:51,440
unknowable to make it known and that's

1425
00:52:49,760 --> 00:52:53,319
partly what we're trying to do in this

1426
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:54,720
series and what you're trying to do

1427
00:52:53,319 --> 00:52:56,760
while you're listening and all of that

1428
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:59,079
and so good for

1429
00:52:56,760 --> 00:53:01,319
that and also that Nation whom they

1430
00:52:59,079 --> 00:53:03,240
Shall Serve I will judge and afterward

1431
00:53:01,319 --> 00:53:05,000
they'll come out with great substance

1432
00:53:03,240 --> 00:53:06,880
there'll be a period of tyranny you know

1433
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,440
and there's a psychological truth to

1434
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:10,799
that too one of the things I learned

1435
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:13,160
from Reading nche because you can learn

1436
00:53:10,799 --> 00:53:14,920
a lot from Reading nche that's for sure

1437
00:53:13,160 --> 00:53:16,640
he he talked about the Catholic church

1438
00:53:14,920 --> 00:53:18,400
and you know n is often construed as a

1439
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:21,760
great critic of Christianity and and he

1440
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:23,680
certainly was but he was no casual

1441
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:24,960
critic in fact I think he was the sort

1442
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:25,720
of critic that you'd like to have as a

1443
00:53:24,960 --> 00:53:27,119
friend

1444
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:29,599
because he was the sort of critic that

1445
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:31,359
said well here's the great things you've

1446
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:33,119
done and that you could keep doing but

1447
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:35,920
here's a bunch of really things that you

1448
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:37,680
did that you really should stop doing

1449
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:39,760
and he talked about the Catholic church

1450
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:42,839
and he said what the Catholic church had

1451
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:46,599
done to the European mind in particular

1452
00:53:42,839 --> 00:53:50,000
was discipline it so that over a period

1453
00:53:46,599 --> 00:53:52,160
of a, years 1300 years 1,400 years there

1454
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:54,079
was this rule that there was a a

1455
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:55,960
conceptual structure within which you

1456
00:53:54,079 --> 00:53:58,160
had to interpret everything thing and

1457
00:53:55,960 --> 00:54:00,760
what that did was turn the European

1458
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:03,400
educated European mind into a

1459
00:54:00,760 --> 00:54:05,400
systematizing cognitive entity and that

1460
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:07,520
once that systematizing cognitive entity

1461
00:54:05,400 --> 00:54:09,079
had been established then it could free

1462
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:10,839
itself from those underlying

1463
00:54:09,079 --> 00:54:14,040
disciplinary structures and go off and

1464
00:54:10,839 --> 00:54:15,960
do such things as produce the Scientific

1465
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:18,559
Revolution for example which required

1466
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:20,240
incredible systematic thinking and so n

1467
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:23,520
had this really interesting idea about

1468
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:25,920
freedom and he believed that slavery was

1469
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:27,680
an intermediary between the undeveloped

1470
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:30,400
individual and the free individual that

1471
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:33,280
you had to you had to submit yourself to

1472
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:35,160
some intense disciplinary process for

1473
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:37,200
some period of time in your life before

1474
00:54:35,160 --> 00:54:38,720
you could develop any true freedom and

1475
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:39,880
so you think maybe you want to learn to

1476
00:54:38,720 --> 00:54:41,599
play the piano it's like that's not

1477
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:42,880
going to be any fun for a really long

1478
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:44,680
period of time right because you're

1479
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:45,960
really bad at it and there's a million

1480
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:49,000
things you have to memorize and you have

1481
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:50,920
to stumble around like a well like an

1482
00:54:49,000 --> 00:54:52,400
amateure and the same thing happens when

1483
00:54:50,920 --> 00:54:53,839
kids learn how to read and some of them

1484
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:55,240
never get past that point and they never

1485
00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:57,040
get to the point where they can enjoy

1486
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:58,440
reading but in order to put yourself

1487
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:00,319
together you have to put yourself in a

1488
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:03,040
vice and allow yourself to be

1489
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:05,359
constricted and mangled even by the the

1490
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:07,640
thing that enslaves you but the the goal

1491
00:55:05,359 --> 00:55:09,119
should be that as a consequence of

1492
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:11,240
submitting to the discipline that you

1493
00:55:09,119 --> 00:55:12,720
become disciplined and then once you

1494
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:14,559
become disciplined you can emerge from

1495
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:16,680
the disciplinary structure as someone

1496
00:55:14,559 --> 00:55:19,599
who's free and that's something that's

1497
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:22,920
very much worth thinking about as well

1498
00:55:19,599 --> 00:55:25,720
so that's Illustrated conceptually in

1499
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:27,720
this in this

1500
00:55:25,720 --> 00:55:30,760
piece of literature let's say because

1501
00:55:27,720 --> 00:55:34,039
what what the psychological meaning of

1502
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:36,920
what God tells Abraham is that all

1503
00:55:34,039 --> 00:55:38,720
people all people are subject and I mean

1504
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:41,079
not equally obviously all people are

1505
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:44,079
subject to the Tyranny that precedes

1506
00:55:41,079 --> 00:55:45,520
freedom and that that idea is is

1507
00:55:44,079 --> 00:55:47,119
repeated over and over in the Old

1508
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:48,799
Testament it comes out most particularly

1509
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:50,319
in the story of Moses right because of

1510
00:55:48,799 --> 00:55:53,079
course that's the story of movement from

1511
00:55:50,319 --> 00:55:54,599
tyranny where do you go from a tyranny

1512
00:55:53,079 --> 00:55:57,400
it's an absolute catastrophe you go from

1513
00:55:54,599 --> 00:55:59,920
a Tyran into the desert you know where

1514
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:02,079
you starve it's harsh that's what

1515
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:03,720
happens in the in the story of Exodus

1516
00:56:02,079 --> 00:56:06,240
and so that's so interesting too because

1517
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:07,920
what it means is that sometimes if

1518
00:56:06,240 --> 00:56:09,920
you're going to move uphill the first

1519
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:12,559
thing that happens is you move downhill

1520
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:15,319
a lot and so if you want to escape from

1521
00:56:12,559 --> 00:56:16,720
The Straits that bind you now you're not

1522
00:56:15,319 --> 00:56:18,720
going to move forward and go up you're

1523
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:20,559
going to move forward and go down and

1524
00:56:18,720 --> 00:56:22,039
that's another reason this is also

1525
00:56:20,559 --> 00:56:23,319
something that Yung talked about a lot

1526
00:56:22,039 --> 00:56:25,240
is that you know on the road to

1527
00:56:23,319 --> 00:56:26,720
Enlightenment you encounter all the

1528
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:28,160
things that you don't want to encounter

1529
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:30,400
first like all the weaknesses of

1530
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:32,280
yourself all the realizations of the

1531
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:34,160
tyranny of the world and the catastrophe

1532
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:36,359
of Nature and all of that and so you

1533
00:56:34,160 --> 00:56:38,440
step out of your encapsulation your

1534
00:56:36,359 --> 00:56:40,079
ignorant encapsulation and it's

1535
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:42,440
immediate plummet into something that's

1536
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:43,880
a desert let's say where everything is

1537
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:45,880
chaotic and where you're wandering

1538
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:48,000
around without Direction a real

1539
00:56:45,880 --> 00:56:49,599
catastrophe so it's you know because one

1540
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:52,319
of the things you might ask yourself is

1541
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:53,920
that if Enlightenment is possible then

1542
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:55,440
why aren't people enlightened because if

1543
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:57,359
it was just a matter matter of going

1544
00:56:55,440 --> 00:56:59,240
from a good place to a better place it's

1545
00:56:57,359 --> 00:57:01,319
like well man let's just get at it it's

1546
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:04,240
no it's no problem right why would we

1547
00:57:01,319 --> 00:57:06,079
ever stop doing that but it seems not to

1548
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:07,960
be that it's that you're here and that's

1549
00:57:06,079 --> 00:57:10,680
not good and it's unstable and you step

1550
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:12,480
out of it and it's like down down to

1551
00:57:10,680 --> 00:57:13,960
where you don't want to be and you have

1552
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:16,160
to contend with that and then maybe you

1553
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:18,920
can start your struggle upward and so

1554
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:21,480
Abraham God is telling Abraham this and

1555
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:23,720
he's also telling him that it's okay

1556
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:25,480
it's rough though and now and thou shalt

1557
00:57:23,720 --> 00:57:27,960
go to thy fathers in peace Thou shalt be

1558
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:29,760
buried in a good old age but in the

1559
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:31,839
fourth generation they shall come hither

1560
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:33,799
again that's the Israelites the the

1561
00:57:31,839 --> 00:57:36,280
descendants of Abraham for the iniquity

1562
00:57:33,799 --> 00:57:38,079
of the amorites is not yet full God is

1563
00:57:36,280 --> 00:57:40,640
going to leave the tyrants alone until

1564
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:44,599
they've manifested their full tyranny

1565
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:44,599
for reasons that we don't fully

1566
00:57:46,880 --> 00:57:51,000
understand and it came to pass that when

1567
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:52,680
the sun went down and it was dark Behold

1568
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:55,559
a smoking furnace and a burning lamp

1569
00:57:52,680 --> 00:57:57,559
that passed between the pieces Al Albert

1570
00:57:55,559 --> 00:57:59,799
Barn said the oven of smoke and lamp of

1571
00:57:57,559 --> 00:58:01,559
flame symbolize the smoke of Destruction

1572
00:57:59,799 --> 00:58:04,319
which we've already talked about this

1573
00:58:01,559 --> 00:58:06,319
catastrophe of of the initial stages and

1574
00:58:04,319 --> 00:58:07,760
the light of Salvation they're passing

1575
00:58:06,319 --> 00:58:09,559
through the pieces of the victims and

1576
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:11,680
probably consuming them as an accepted

1577
00:58:09,559 --> 00:58:13,599
sacrifice are the ratification of the

1578
00:58:11,680 --> 00:58:15,039
Covenant on the part of God as the

1579
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:16,280
dividing and presenting of them were on

1580
00:58:15,039 --> 00:58:18,559
the part of

1581
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:21,200
Abram in the same day the Lord made a

1582
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:22,799
covenant with Abram saying unto thy seed

1583
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:26,079
I have given this land from the river of

1584
00:58:22,799 --> 00:58:29,280
Egypt unto the Great River euphra

1585
00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:31,520
IES now Sarai Abram's wife beam no

1586
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:34,520
children and she had a handmade an

1587
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:36,839
Egyptian whose name was Hagar so this is

1588
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:39,880
a big catastrophe for Abraham especially

1589
00:58:36,839 --> 00:58:42,119
in those times and perhaps now as

1590
00:58:39,880 --> 00:58:44,000
much although perhaps people aren't as

1591
00:58:42,119 --> 00:58:48,280
conscious of it as they once were I mean

1592
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:51,520
for Abraham without a a biological son

1593
00:58:48,280 --> 00:58:53,720
there was no there was no there was no

1594
00:58:51,520 --> 00:58:56,039
vision forward into the future you know

1595
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:57,520
and I mean we don't really know what

1596
00:58:56,039 --> 00:58:59,839
sort of time span over which these

1597
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:01,559
archaic people thought but the medieval

1598
00:58:59,839 --> 00:59:03,520
people we already said could think 300

1599
00:59:01,559 --> 00:59:06,119
years into the future without without

1600
00:59:03,520 --> 00:59:07,240
batting an eye and these people who were

1601
00:59:06,119 --> 00:59:08,559
who were concerned about their

1602
00:59:07,240 --> 00:59:10,119
descendants were obviously thinking

1603
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:11,920
about existence in a way that wasn't

1604
00:59:10,119 --> 00:59:13,880
just focused on their immediate

1605
00:59:11,920 --> 00:59:14,799
existence right they were thinking about

1606
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:15,720
well their children and their

1607
00:59:14,799 --> 00:59:17,280
grandchildren maybe their

1608
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:19,440
great-grandchildren maybe the whole

1609
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:21,680
society that that stemmed out from them

1610
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:23,839
and that's that's smart you know one of

1611
00:59:21,680 --> 00:59:25,480
the things I learned from PJ at least in

1612
00:59:23,839 --> 00:59:27,440
part was that

1613
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:29,440
his idea of the equilibrated state which

1614
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:32,280
he thought about as partly part of the

1615
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:33,880
biological basis of the idea of moral

1616
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:36,880
progress it's something like that he was

1617
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:39,160
a very very smart PJ know he said that

1618
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:40,960
the the proper equilibrated state is one

1619
00:59:39,160 --> 00:59:42,559
where imagine you have a family you got

1620
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:44,280
five people in it and you're doing what

1621
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:45,960
you want in in your family what's good

1622
00:59:44,280 --> 00:59:47,400
for you but you're doing it in such a

1623
00:59:45,960 --> 00:59:50,079
way so that the other four members of

1624
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:52,079
your family agree with what you do and

1625
00:59:50,079 --> 00:59:53,799
that it also facilitates them doing what

1626
00:59:52,079 --> 00:59:55,720
they want and what they should be doing

1627
00:59:53,799 --> 00:59:58,000
and so it's a really tricky arrangement

1628
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:59,599
because it isn't just for you it's for

1629
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:01,200
you in a way that's for them and you

1630
00:59:59,599 --> 01:00:02,760
could also see that that would be

1631
01:00:01,200 --> 01:00:05,160
something that would be a multiplier

1632
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:08,079
right because if you have everyone

1633
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:10,359
working voluntarily towards the same

1634
01:00:08,079 --> 01:00:12,280
common goal then you get a multiplying

1635
01:00:10,359 --> 01:00:16,200
effect of that and then you might think

1636
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:18,319
well it's not just you and your family

1637
01:00:16,200 --> 01:00:20,359
it's you and your family today and next

1638
01:00:18,319 --> 01:00:21,640
week and next month the next year and 10

1639
01:00:20,359 --> 01:00:23,440
years from now so you have to take the

1640
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:24,880
time span into account and then it

1641
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:27,039
should be you and your family in a way

1642
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:28,720
that works well in society and then it

1643
01:00:27,039 --> 01:00:30,200
should work well now and next week and

1644
01:00:28,720 --> 01:00:32,079
next year and into the future it should

1645
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:33,799
be iterable right that's like

1646
01:00:32,079 --> 01:00:36,599
sustainability it's something like the

1647
01:00:33,799 --> 01:00:38,359
idea of sustainability and that's that's

1648
01:00:36,599 --> 01:00:41,000
I would say that's a reasonable way of

1649
01:00:38,359 --> 01:00:42,280
conceptualizing the holy city it's it's

1650
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,920
something like that you know if you're

1651
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:45,599
if you're trying to make it concrete

1652
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:47,000
it's like how should you live your life

1653
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:49,119
well let's say you live your life in a

1654
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:51,599
manner that justifies its limitation and

1655
01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:53,160
tragedy that's a good start but then

1656
01:00:51,599 --> 01:00:55,559
let's say that it does that in a way

1657
01:00:53,160 --> 01:00:56,760
that also reduces the limitations and

1658
01:00:55,559 --> 01:00:58,599
suffering of the people that you

1659
01:00:56,760 --> 01:01:01,520
interact with and now and into the

1660
01:00:58,599 --> 01:01:03,839
future well maybe there's a way to do

1661
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:05,119
that I mean a good negotiation does that

1662
01:01:03,839 --> 01:01:07,200
right because if you're negotiating with

1663
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:09,680
someone like your wife for example what

1664
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:11,480
you want is for her to agree with the

1665
01:01:09,680 --> 01:01:13,720
negotiation and one of the things that

1666
01:01:11,480 --> 01:01:16,240
PJ said which I think was brilliant

1667
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:19,319
brilliant he said if you take an

1668
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:21,119
equilibrated system a family let's say

1669
01:01:19,319 --> 01:01:22,559
and a dise equilibrated system so that

1670
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:24,480
would be one where let's say the father

1671
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:26,880
is a tyrant and everyone is operating

1672
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:28,000
under his Whip and you put them in a

1673
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:30,319
head-to-head

1674
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:33,119
competition the equilibrated system will

1675
01:01:30,319 --> 01:01:35,039
outcompete the disequil system because

1676
01:01:33,119 --> 01:01:36,960
the enforcement cost is such that it

1677
01:01:35,039 --> 01:01:38,520
will slow the system down you know

1678
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:40,799
because you'll get resistances from the

1679
01:01:38,520 --> 01:01:42,319
people inside the system they'll work it

1680
01:01:40,799 --> 01:01:43,880
the system will be working at counter

1681
01:01:42,319 --> 01:01:46,599
purposes to itself plus there's

1682
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:48,920
enforcement costs and so a tyranny

1683
01:01:46,599 --> 01:01:51,000
cannot beat an equilibrated system and I

1684
01:01:48,920 --> 01:01:53,240
was really excited to encounter that

1685
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:54,920
idea because when I encountered it I was

1686
01:01:53,240 --> 01:01:55,960
also trying to figure out if there was

1687
01:01:54,920 --> 01:01:58,599
some

1688
01:01:55,960 --> 01:02:00,200
quantitative difference between the

1689
01:01:58,599 --> 01:02:02,680
systems say of the Soviet Union and

1690
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:05,319
maest China and the systems of the West

1691
01:02:02,680 --> 01:02:07,160
apart from just you know arbitrary World

1692
01:02:05,319 --> 01:02:08,720
interpretation as the postmodern

1693
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:10,920
nihilists might have it if there was

1694
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:13,000
something fundamental at stake in the

1695
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:15,000
terrible cold war that we fought or if

1696
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:18,520
it was just a matter of opinion you know

1697
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:19,920
in the pedian take was that well roughly

1698
01:02:18,520 --> 01:02:21,839
speaking is that the West Was An

1699
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:23,799
equilibrated system not perfectly

1700
01:02:21,839 --> 01:02:25,920
equilibrated but reasonably equilibrated

1701
01:02:23,799 --> 01:02:27,839
in that people were essentially even if

1702
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:29,839
they were slaves to some degree they

1703
01:02:27,839 --> 01:02:31,680
were at least voluntary slaves instead

1704
01:02:29,839 --> 01:02:33,760
of involuntary slaves and that that was

1705
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:36,160
better the system was actually

1706
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:38,319
technically better and not just as a

1707
01:02:36,160 --> 01:02:39,839
matter of interpretation so that's a

1708
01:02:38,319 --> 01:02:42,640
lovely thing to know and I think it's a

1709
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:44,960
really really solid really really solid

1710
01:02:42,640 --> 01:02:46,839
idea I haven't been able to you know put

1711
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:49,279
crowbars under that idea and lift it up

1712
01:02:46,839 --> 01:02:52,359
I think it's a good one

1713
01:02:49,279 --> 01:02:54,039
so now Sarai Abram's wife baram no

1714
01:02:52,359 --> 01:02:56,359
children so okay back to children well

1715
01:02:54,039 --> 01:02:57,760
so one of what one of the things that's

1716
01:02:56,359 --> 01:02:59,039
worth thinking about with regards to

1717
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:01,720
reading these old stories because we're

1718
01:02:59,039 --> 01:03:03,079
so we're very arrogant modern people eh

1719
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:05,079
we look at these old stories and we

1720
01:03:03,079 --> 01:03:06,480
think ah we've transcended all that

1721
01:03:05,079 --> 01:03:07,880
Superstition it's like don't be so

1722
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:11,520
bloody sure about that these people

1723
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:13,000
weren't stupid and so there's there

1724
01:03:11,520 --> 01:03:15,480
there are ways that they viewed the

1725
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:18,920
world that we don't have anymore and one

1726
01:03:15,480 --> 01:03:20,720
of them seems to be this concern for

1727
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:22,559
Descendants because that just isn't part

1728
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:24,559
of our way of thinking we have very

1729
01:03:22,559 --> 01:03:26,240
short-term way of thinking maybe it's

1730
01:03:24,559 --> 01:03:28,520
it's not even one lifetime long it's

1731
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:29,839
certainly not multiple lifetimes long

1732
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:32,359
and it isn't clear to me at all that

1733
01:03:29,839 --> 01:03:33,680
that's for the best and you know the the

1734
01:03:32,359 --> 01:03:35,880
constant complaint that the

1735
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:37,720
environmentalists generate some of which

1736
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:39,640
is Justified and some of which is just

1737
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:41,319
anti- capitalist anti-patriarchal

1738
01:03:39,640 --> 01:03:44,039
nonsense that should be cleared out of

1739
01:03:41,319 --> 01:03:46,880
that entire conversation is that we need

1740
01:03:44,039 --> 01:03:48,640
to take a longer View and consider more

1741
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:50,279
things in our purview when not when we

1742
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:51,880
act and like that's fair enough like do

1743
01:03:50,279 --> 01:03:53,799
we really want an ocean that has nothing

1744
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:55,160
in it but jellyfish because that's

1745
01:03:53,799 --> 01:03:56,960
really what we're we're doing and we're

1746
01:03:55,160 --> 01:04:00,000
doing it very very rapidly and the data

1747
01:03:56,960 --> 01:04:01,599
on that are very clear and so you know

1748
01:04:00,000 --> 01:04:02,960
when you lift up your eyes and you make

1749
01:04:01,599 --> 01:04:04,880
a connection with something that's

1750
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:07,039
Transcendent then that should bring more

1751
01:04:04,880 --> 01:04:09,119
of the world within your purview and and

1752
01:04:07,039 --> 01:04:10,599
maybe that's concern for the endless

1753
01:04:09,119 --> 01:04:12,760
number of descendants that you might

1754
01:04:10,599 --> 01:04:14,680
have you might think too well you know

1755
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:17,400
if you're a successful person if you

1756
01:04:14,680 --> 01:04:19,279
have a successful family God only knows

1757
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:21,720
how many people you will be the father

1758
01:04:19,279 --> 01:04:24,000
of right it's completely cuz you're a

1759
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:26,240
Nexus right all sorts of things have

1760
01:04:24,000 --> 01:04:28,200
come together in the cosmos to produce

1761
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:30,279
you and then all things sorts of things

1762
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:32,599
manifest themselves from you you have no

1763
01:04:30,279 --> 01:04:35,000
idea what your potential the potential

1764
01:04:32,599 --> 01:04:38,160
consequences of your actions might be as

1765
01:04:35,000 --> 01:04:40,480
they Cascade across time right you have

1766
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:42,200
no idea and so Abraham at least is

1767
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:44,079
concerned with these sorts of things and

1768
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:46,359
God seems to be concerned too because he

1769
01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:48,240
promises Abraham that if he maintains

1770
01:04:46,359 --> 01:04:51,039
the Covenant that the most important

1771
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:53,279
things that he needs will come to

1772
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:56,520
him and they're pretty serious about

1773
01:04:53,279 --> 01:04:58,000
this so Sarai talks to Abram she's not

1774
01:04:56,520 --> 01:05:00,599
very happy about the fact that she can't

1775
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:03,200
have children she says behold now the

1776
01:05:00,599 --> 01:05:06,079
Lord hath restrained me from bearing I

1777
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:08,599
pray thee go in unto my maid it may be

1778
01:05:06,079 --> 01:05:10,839
that I obtain children by her and Abram

1779
01:05:08,599 --> 01:05:12,279
hearkened to the voice of Sarai well

1780
01:05:10,839 --> 01:05:14,119
that's not a very trivial thing I

1781
01:05:12,279 --> 01:05:16,279
wouldn't think I don't imagine that that

1782
01:05:14,119 --> 01:05:18,480
Sarah was Sarai was very happy about

1783
01:05:16,279 --> 01:05:20,920
turning her maid over to her husband and

1784
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:23,160
potentially being usurped in the whole

1785
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:25,480
childbearing uh in the whole

1786
01:05:23,160 --> 01:05:27,359
childbearing process not in the least

1787
01:05:25,480 --> 01:05:29,160
but you know so it's also a major

1788
01:05:27,359 --> 01:05:31,880
sacrifice on sarai's part there's no

1789
01:05:29,160 --> 01:05:33,039
doubt about that and of course it's very

1790
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:35,160
difficult for us to talk about the

1791
01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:37,359
ethics of the fact that Hagar was a more

1792
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:39,520
or less involuntary participant in this

1793
01:05:37,359 --> 01:05:42,000
but that was the times absolutely the

1794
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:43,720
case and of course slavery and

1795
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:46,319
indentured servitude is the way of

1796
01:05:43,720 --> 01:05:48,400
mankind except in very very in very very

1797
01:05:46,319 --> 01:05:50,039
limited circumstances Carl Yung had

1798
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:50,799
something to say about that too which I

1799
01:05:50,039 --> 01:05:53,039
really

1800
01:05:50,799 --> 01:05:54,599
liked he said that part of the reason

1801
01:05:53,039 --> 01:05:56,119
that modern people have

1802
01:05:54,599 --> 01:05:59,240
it's not the only reason there's the

1803
01:05:56,119 --> 01:06:00,599
Industrial Revolution obviously but part

1804
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:03,319
of the reason that modern people have

1805
01:06:00,599 --> 01:06:05,480
been able to escape from the catastrophe

1806
01:06:03,319 --> 01:06:07,480
of tyranny and slavery is because we've

1807
01:06:05,480 --> 01:06:09,520
agreed to make ourselves our own

1808
01:06:07,480 --> 01:06:12,119
slaves right so instead of owning a

1809
01:06:09,520 --> 01:06:13,920
slave you own yourself in a sense and so

1810
01:06:12,119 --> 01:06:15,480
you Trot yourself off to work and

1811
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:16,839
exploit yourself so that you can stay

1812
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:18,760
alive and maybe it's not something that

1813
01:06:16,839 --> 01:06:20,960
you want to do but you've taken on the

1814
01:06:18,760 --> 01:06:22,359
role of slave in some sense in

1815
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:24,240
relationship to your own Survival

1816
01:06:22,359 --> 01:06:25,599
instead of forcing someone else to do it

1817
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:28,400
which is also something I think that's

1818
01:06:25,599 --> 01:06:29,960
very Noble about the West is that we're

1819
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:31,559
willing to enslave ourselves as

1820
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:33,039
individuals and we're not we're not

1821
01:06:31,559 --> 01:06:34,559
doing that to other people now we're

1822
01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:36,079
doing it to some degree obviously

1823
01:06:34,559 --> 01:06:37,359
because the society is imperfect but

1824
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:41,039
that's something that's very much worth

1825
01:06:37,359 --> 01:06:44,440
thinking about so and Abram hearkened to

1826
01:06:41,039 --> 01:06:47,279
the voice of Sarai and Sarai Abram's

1827
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:49,039
wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian

1828
01:06:47,279 --> 01:06:50,839
after Abram had dwelt 10 years in the

1829
01:06:49,039 --> 01:06:53,000
land of Canaan and gave her to her

1830
01:06:50,839 --> 01:06:54,880
husband Abram to be his

1831
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:56,119
wife

1832
01:06:54,880 --> 01:06:57,680
that's the other thing that's been so

1833
01:06:56,119 --> 01:06:59,200
interesting about doing this one of the

1834
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:00,440
other things about doing this biblical

1835
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:03,440
series and it's one of the things that's

1836
01:07:00,440 --> 01:07:06,680
so cool about Google um despite the fact

1837
01:07:03,440 --> 01:07:10,480
that they cut off my

1838
01:07:06,680 --> 01:07:12,880
account um you can find any piece of art

1839
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:14,319
that ever existed on Google and so

1840
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:16,720
that's great so you know when I'm trying

1841
01:07:14,319 --> 01:07:20,240
to illustrate these these lectures I

1842
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:22,359
type in Abraham Renaissance and then

1843
01:07:20,240 --> 01:07:23,720
like I get 200 Renaissance paintings

1844
01:07:22,359 --> 01:07:25,599
it's so great and then I can look at

1845
01:07:23,720 --> 01:07:27,440
them one of the other things that's so

1846
01:07:25,599 --> 01:07:29,240
remarkable is that all of these the

1847
01:07:27,440 --> 01:07:32,480
major themes of these stories have been

1848
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:36,520
illustrated by people of

1849
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:38,400
spectacular M mind mind expanding Talent

1850
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:41,720
you know there's just this

1851
01:07:38,400 --> 01:07:44,400
endless array of well look at that I

1852
01:07:41,720 --> 01:07:47,240
mean that's an amazing

1853
01:07:44,400 --> 01:07:49,440
painting and so and there's and and of

1854
01:07:47,240 --> 01:07:51,480
this there's there's dozens of paintings

1855
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:53,640
on on this theme and it's just another

1856
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:55,880
indication of how obsessed people you

1857
01:07:53,640 --> 01:07:57,799
know this was the only book that existed

1858
01:07:55,880 --> 01:08:00,079
for years and people were absolutely

1859
01:07:57,799 --> 01:08:02,520
obsessed by it and produced all these

1860
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:04,119
amazing things from it and we're in

1861
01:08:02,520 --> 01:08:06,720
danger of losing that and that's a big

1862
01:08:04,119 --> 01:08:08,440
mistake because it's magnificent a

1863
01:08:06,720 --> 01:08:10,200
little humility would go a long way

1864
01:08:08,440 --> 01:08:14,359
towards restoring

1865
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:16,440
it and he went into unto Hagar and she

1866
01:08:14,359 --> 01:08:18,480
conceived and when she saw that she had

1867
01:08:16,440 --> 01:08:23,040
conceived her mistress was despised in

1868
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:25,880
her eyes so Hagar was successful and

1869
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:29,640
like that was a Hallmark of feminine

1870
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:32,000
success now and certainly then and so

1871
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:33,640
she started to Lord it over Sarai which

1872
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:35,719
seemed a little bit on the

1873
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:38,239
ungrateful side I would say because

1874
01:08:35,719 --> 01:08:40,960
Sarai made a big sacrifice to allow

1875
01:08:38,239 --> 01:08:42,440
Hagar to become Abram's wife and so a

1876
01:08:40,960 --> 01:08:44,920
little bit of gratitude would have been

1877
01:08:42,440 --> 01:08:47,040
in order I suppose at least that's how

1878
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:50,560
the story goes and Sarai said unto

1879
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:53,040
Abraham my wrong be upon thee I have

1880
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:55,199
given my maid into thy bosom and when

1881
01:08:53,040 --> 01:08:57,880
she saw that she had conceived I was

1882
01:08:55,199 --> 01:08:59,920
despised In Her Eyes the Lord judged

1883
01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:02,920
between you and

1884
01:08:59,920 --> 01:09:04,799
I and Abraham said unto Sarai Behold thy

1885
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:07,520
maid is in thine hand do to her as it

1886
01:09:04,799 --> 01:09:10,000
pleases you and when Sarai dealt hardly

1887
01:09:07,520 --> 01:09:11,440
with her Hagar fled from her face and

1888
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,880
the angel of the Lord found her by a

1889
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:14,480
fountain of water in the wilderness by

1890
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:17,679
the fountain in the way to Shure and he

1891
01:09:14,480 --> 01:09:20,159
said Hagar sir's maid whence camest thou

1892
01:09:17,679 --> 01:09:22,600
and withi wilt thou go and she said I

1893
01:09:20,159 --> 01:09:24,239
flee from the face of my mistress Sarai

1894
01:09:22,600 --> 01:09:26,480
and the angel of the Lord said

1895
01:09:24,239 --> 01:09:28,839
return to thy mistress and submit under

1896
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:30,920
her hands and the angel said I will

1897
01:09:28,839 --> 01:09:33,239
multiply your seed exceedingly that it

1898
01:09:30,920 --> 01:09:35,080
shall not be numbered for multitude and

1899
01:09:33,239 --> 01:09:37,080
the angel said behold thou art with

1900
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:39,839
child and th shall Thou shalt bear a son

1901
01:09:37,080 --> 01:09:42,480
and shall shall call his name ishmail

1902
01:09:39,839 --> 01:09:43,759
and Ishmael means God Hears by the way

1903
01:09:42,480 --> 01:09:45,560
because the Lord hath heard thy

1904
01:09:43,759 --> 01:09:47,400
Affliction and he'll be a wild man his

1905
01:09:45,560 --> 01:09:49,640
hand will be against every man and every

1906
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:52,400
man's hand against him and he shall

1907
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:54,560
dwell in the presence of all his

1908
01:09:52,400 --> 01:09:56,880
brothers and she she called the name of

1909
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:59,520
the Lord that spake unto her thou God

1910
01:09:56,880 --> 01:10:01,840
seest me for she said have I also here

1911
01:09:59,520 --> 01:10:04,239
looked after him that seeth me wherefore

1912
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:06,800
the W well was called beer

1913
01:10:04,239 --> 01:10:08,719
laroy and that means the well who sees

1914
01:10:06,800 --> 01:10:12,239
me and lives it's an interesting

1915
01:10:08,719 --> 01:10:13,800
interlude because you know Abraham God

1916
01:10:12,239 --> 01:10:15,600
has established this Covenant with

1917
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:17,040
Abraham and obviously things are going

1918
01:10:15,600 --> 01:10:19,560
wrong in the household in a really

1919
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:22,199
serious way like a really serious way

1920
01:10:19,560 --> 01:10:24,280
because well he's now had a child by

1921
01:10:22,199 --> 01:10:26,239
another woman and that the two women are

1922
01:10:24,280 --> 01:10:27,800
not getting along and one is beating the

1923
01:10:26,239 --> 01:10:31,080
other because of her

1924
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:32,960
insubordination and and contempt and so

1925
01:10:31,080 --> 01:10:35,640
she's so desperate she runs out into the

1926
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:38,840
desert where she's probably going to die

1927
01:10:35,640 --> 01:10:43,880
and God comes along and says anyways to

1928
01:10:38,840 --> 01:10:46,120
to to to Hagar that her son shall as

1929
01:10:43,880 --> 01:10:47,760
well be the father of Nations and so

1930
01:10:46,120 --> 01:10:49,440
that's partly a reflection back on the

1931
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:50,840
power of Abraham's Covenant right even

1932
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:53,280
though even though things are going

1933
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:54,800
terribly wrong locally let's say the

1934
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:57,280
fact that Abraham has made this

1935
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:58,760
overarching agreement with God means

1936
01:10:57,280 --> 01:11:01,239
that all of these catastrophes are

1937
01:10:58,760 --> 01:11:02,880
taking place within a bounded space

1938
01:11:01,239 --> 01:11:05,440
within the ark we could say that's one

1939
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:06,960
way of looking at it and I I do think I

1940
01:11:05,440 --> 01:11:10,480
do think that that's right because it

1941
01:11:06,960 --> 01:11:13,360
seems to me that you know if everything

1942
01:11:10,480 --> 01:11:14,440
falls apart around you there's there's a

1943
01:11:13,360 --> 01:11:15,679
couple of things you're going to want

1944
01:11:14,440 --> 01:11:18,120
you're going to want someone standing

1945
01:11:15,679 --> 01:11:19,679
beside you that's for sure that you can

1946
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:21,719
trust you're going to want your family

1947
01:11:19,679 --> 01:11:23,239
around you and you want going to want

1948
01:11:21,719 --> 01:11:25,080
them to have your back and you're going

1949
01:11:23,239 --> 01:11:27,840
to want know that you didn't do some

1950
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:29,880
godamn stupid thing to bring all hell

1951
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:32,320
down on yourself and if you're lacking

1952
01:11:29,880 --> 01:11:33,600
any of those when that crisis comes

1953
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:34,920
there's a high probability it will

1954
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:37,199
flatten you and you won't be able to get

1955
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:40,760
up you know it does seem to me you can

1956
01:11:37,199 --> 01:11:43,480
ask yourself this question when things

1957
01:11:40,760 --> 01:11:46,239
collapse around you how much utility is

1958
01:11:43,480 --> 01:11:47,960
knowledge of your own moral virtue it's

1959
01:11:46,239 --> 01:11:50,600
bad enough to be late it's bad to be

1960
01:11:47,960 --> 01:11:53,080
laid low but to be laid low and to know

1961
01:11:50,600 --> 01:11:55,320
that you were the fault you were at

1962
01:11:53,080 --> 01:11:56,920
fault for for it and worse the things

1963
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:59,040
that you did that you knew you did that

1964
01:11:56,920 --> 01:12:00,800
were wrong brought you there then I

1965
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:02,600
think you have nothing to stand on in

1966
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:04,199
that situation and that's also the

1967
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:06,440
circumstances under which I think you're

1968
01:12:04,199 --> 01:12:09,880
more more likely at least to be

1969
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:11,560
abandoned by people around you so given

1970
01:12:09,880 --> 01:12:13,320
that you know that the catastrophe is

1971
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:15,000
coming right that the tragedy of life

1972
01:12:13,320 --> 01:12:17,120
will strike you the question is well how

1973
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:20,400
do you fortify yourself against that and

1974
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:22,560
all obviously to some degree you do that

1975
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:24,400
by being materially sensible and these

1976
01:12:22,560 --> 01:12:25,719
old people in the the test in the Old

1977
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:28,719
Testament these ancient people they

1978
01:12:25,719 --> 01:12:31,199
weren't blind to the utility of having a

1979
01:12:28,719 --> 01:12:33,040
good crop and some animals you know that

1980
01:12:31,199 --> 01:12:34,360
that's a that's a integral part of their

1981
01:12:33,040 --> 01:12:36,920
life to take care of themselves

1982
01:12:34,360 --> 01:12:39,840
physically but they're also wise enough

1983
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:42,880
to know that there's an element of

1984
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:45,920
moral NE what would you call it there's

1985
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:48,080
a necessity for moral integration that

1986
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:50,360
defends you against the catastrophy of

1987
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:53,159
existence even more effectively than

1988
01:12:50,360 --> 01:12:55,679
anything material and even more that

1989
01:12:53,159 --> 01:12:57,840
this stability of the material things is

1990
01:12:55,679 --> 01:12:59,719
more dependent on the Integrity of your

1991
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:01,920
spirit than the Integrity of your spirit

1992
01:12:59,719 --> 01:13:03,199
is dependent on the material things and

1993
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:05,679
I think the evidence for that is

1994
01:13:03,199 --> 01:13:07,400
actually quite clear I read read a very

1995
01:13:05,679 --> 01:13:09,000
interesting book a while back called the

1996
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:10,800
wealth and poverty of Nations that was

1997
01:13:09,000 --> 01:13:12,679
written by a Harvard Emeritus professor

1998
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:14,679
of history and one of the things that he

1999
01:13:12,679 --> 01:13:17,639
claimed I liked it I thought it was very

2000
01:13:14,679 --> 01:13:20,239
smart was that the only true natural

2001
01:13:17,639 --> 01:13:22,120
resource is interpersonal trust if you

2002
01:13:20,239 --> 01:13:23,719
can set up a society where people trust

2003
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:26,320
each other then it will instantly become

2004
01:13:23,719 --> 01:13:28,600
rich and he used the example of Japan

2005
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:30,560
which is a very conscientious society

2006
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:33,320
and very rich Society but the Japanese

2007
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:35,199
have no natural resources right none to

2008
01:13:33,320 --> 01:13:37,000
speak of and yet they're rich and then

2009
01:13:35,199 --> 01:13:38,920
you have countries like the Soviet

2010
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:40,639
Russia and and much of South America

2011
01:13:38,920 --> 01:13:42,040
where there's just natural resources

2012
01:13:40,639 --> 01:13:44,400
that you know they're just like

2013
01:13:42,040 --> 01:13:46,080
Venezuela it's just more natural

2014
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:48,600
resources than you know what to do with

2015
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:50,840
and the places are absolute

2016
01:13:48,600 --> 01:13:54,159
catastrophes absolute catastrophes of

2017
01:13:50,840 --> 01:13:56,080
cynicism and Corruption and so he

2018
01:13:54,159 --> 01:13:58,560
attempted to document the relationship

2019
01:13:56,080 --> 01:14:01,560
between default interpersonal trust

2020
01:13:58,560 --> 01:14:03,600
among citizens within countries and

2021
01:14:01,560 --> 01:14:05,560
their their productivity and their their

2022
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:07,360
GDP and their their standard of living

2023
01:14:05,560 --> 01:14:09,520
and found a very very tight relationship

2024
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:11,719
and and I like that a lot and I've got a

2025
01:14:09,520 --> 01:14:13,719
story about that quickly that I think is

2026
01:14:11,719 --> 01:14:16,239
very interesting I'll tell you two

2027
01:14:13,719 --> 01:14:18,360
stories one sort of

2028
01:14:16,239 --> 01:14:20,639
generic um well I'll tell you one

2029
01:14:18,360 --> 01:14:22,480
personal first so one day I lent my car

2030
01:14:20,639 --> 01:14:24,280
to one of my graduate students and he

2031
01:14:22,480 --> 01:14:27,880
took it to Montreal was this old

2032
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:29,440
Cadillac and uh he got it was a really

2033
01:14:27,880 --> 01:14:32,120
bad rainstorm in Montreal and he was in

2034
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:33,600
one of the highways that are like set

2035
01:14:32,120 --> 01:14:35,679
into the ground and there was like 6

2036
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:37,280
Ines of water and he was turning a

2037
01:14:35,679 --> 01:14:39,440
corner hit the brakes and skid it on the

2038
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:41,600
water and smacked it into the wall and

2039
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:43,320
on the corner of the of the bumper you

2040
01:14:41,600 --> 01:14:45,719
know and so then he brought it back and

2041
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:47,840
he was very apologetic about it and and

2042
01:14:45,719 --> 01:14:49,360
uh his name was Matt Shane tell you that

2043
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:52,080
because Matt might hear this and I can

2044
01:14:49,360 --> 01:14:55,000
shame him a bit for doing this 20 years

2045
01:14:52,080 --> 01:14:57,960
ago you know and uh he's a professor at

2046
01:14:55,000 --> 01:15:00,080
uh the Ontario Institute of Technology I

2047
01:14:57,960 --> 01:15:01,880
think now and quite a successful one but

2048
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:05,120
anyways he brought the car back and I

2049
01:15:01,880 --> 01:15:07,560
went and got it evaluated for damages it

2050
01:15:05,120 --> 01:15:10,400
was like $1,700 or something to repair

2051
01:15:07,560 --> 01:15:12,560
it and or maybe more but it was almost

2052
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:16,120
as much as the car was worth I thought

2053
01:15:12,560 --> 01:15:19,400
well I'm not going to do that so I went

2054
01:15:16,120 --> 01:15:21,360
online and I typed in the part and uh if

2055
01:15:19,400 --> 01:15:23,000
you do that you can get people to bid on

2056
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:24,679
sending you a used part from all over

2057
01:15:23,000 --> 01:15:26,320
North America so that's kind of cool so

2058
01:15:24,679 --> 01:15:27,800
there's all these junk dealers have got

2059
01:15:26,320 --> 01:15:29,280
together and they have this you know

2060
01:15:27,800 --> 01:15:30,880
network of communications so you put in

2061
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:33,159
the car part and then they send you a

2062
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:34,840
bid and so this guy said uh well I'll

2063
01:15:33,159 --> 01:15:37,120
send you the bumper assembly which is

2064
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:39,800
the whole bumper and the lights for like

2065
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:41,760
250 bucks and I thought yeah okay you

2066
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:45,480
you could do that that'd be good so then

2067
01:15:41,760 --> 01:15:47,080
I said yes and then he called me up

2068
01:15:45,480 --> 01:15:48,679
about half an hour later this guy from

2069
01:15:47,080 --> 01:15:51,600
way down south he had a really deep sort

2070
01:15:48,679 --> 01:15:53,600
of Mississippi accent he said wait a sec

2071
01:15:51,600 --> 01:15:55,560
was that for the bumper or the bumper

2072
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:57,480
assembly and I said well it was for the

2073
01:15:55,560 --> 01:15:58,840
bumper assembly he said Oh I thought it

2074
01:15:57,480 --> 01:16:00,920
was for the bumper and then he said but

2075
01:15:58,840 --> 01:16:03,239
that's okay I'll send it to you anyways

2076
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:04,639
I thought well that's pretty good so I

2077
01:16:03,239 --> 01:16:06,360
said well thank you and then I hung up

2078
01:16:04,639 --> 01:16:08,280
and then half an hour later he called me

2079
01:16:06,360 --> 01:16:09,840
up again and he said look I just went

2080
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:12,040
out and looked at that bumper assembly

2081
01:16:09,840 --> 01:16:13,679
and there's a plastic trim piece on the

2082
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:14,960
side and it has a scratch in it and I

2083
01:16:13,679 --> 01:16:17,600
thought I better tell you that just in

2084
01:16:14,960 --> 01:16:19,600
case you you didn't want it I thought

2085
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:22,480
wow that's so amazing it's like there's

2086
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:23,880
a miracle man it's like this guy he's

2087
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:25,960
somewhere in Miss Mississippi I'm never

2088
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:28,080
going to see him again ever I'm never

2089
01:16:25,960 --> 01:16:29,880
going to have any contact with him like

2090
01:16:28,080 --> 01:16:31,600
he made a bad deal right because the

2091
01:16:29,880 --> 01:16:33,120
part was worth more than he decided to

2092
01:16:31,600 --> 01:16:35,120
sell it to me for but he stuck with this

2093
01:16:33,120 --> 01:16:36,960
deal and then he went over and above the

2094
01:16:35,120 --> 01:16:39,520
Call of Duty he said well this part that

2095
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:41,600
I'm selling you to you for way less than

2096
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:44,440
it's worth is damaged so I thought I

2097
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:46,280
better tell you it's like man you got to

2098
01:16:44,440 --> 01:16:48,639
recognize a miracle when you see one

2099
01:16:46,280 --> 01:16:51,320
that was a miracle so I I said Hey look

2100
01:16:48,639 --> 01:16:53,120
it's thanks for calling man so okay I

2101
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:55,320
can handle the scratchs send the part

2102
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:57,199
and he did and and I got the car fixed

2103
01:16:55,320 --> 01:16:59,679
and forgave Matt and you know it had a

2104
01:16:57,199 --> 01:17:03,040
happy ending so so that's

2105
01:16:59,679 --> 01:17:05,360
trust right because I didn't know him

2106
01:17:03,040 --> 01:17:07,480
from Adam and he's a primate full of

2107
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:09,360
snakes just like the rest of us and yet

2108
01:17:07,480 --> 01:17:10,679
he was willing to simplify himself to

2109
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:12,679
the point where I could just take him

2110
01:17:10,679 --> 01:17:13,840
absolutely at his word and that meant we

2111
01:17:12,679 --> 01:17:16,199
could trade even though we were

2112
01:17:13,840 --> 01:17:18,120
strangers it's like man do not

2113
01:17:16,199 --> 01:17:19,800
underestimate the utility of that and

2114
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:22,080
then there's eBay so when eBay first

2115
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:24,159
started you know the idea was it's not

2116
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:25,880
going to work cuz you'll send me junk

2117
01:17:24,159 --> 01:17:28,000
and I'll send you a check that bounces

2118
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:30,639
and that'll be the end of eBay right and

2119
01:17:28,000 --> 01:17:32,719
so these escrow agents popped up so you

2120
01:17:30,639 --> 01:17:35,159
could ensure your transaction with them

2121
01:17:32,719 --> 01:17:36,719
was for like 10% of the transaction they

2122
01:17:35,159 --> 01:17:39,080
would get the check and the goods and

2123
01:17:36,719 --> 01:17:41,719
make sure that they were okay and then

2124
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:43,440
send them on or ensure the transaction

2125
01:17:41,719 --> 01:17:45,760
but what happened was the escrow agents

2126
01:17:43,440 --> 01:17:48,320
didn't make any money and the reason for

2127
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:49,880
that was no one cheated now you think

2128
01:17:48,320 --> 01:17:51,880
about how amazing that is right you

2129
01:17:49,880 --> 01:17:53,440
bring these people together across a

2130
01:17:51,880 --> 01:17:54,960
whole continent they've never seen each

2131
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:56,360
other before they're never going to

2132
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:57,960
interact with each other again and this

2133
01:17:56,360 --> 01:18:00,199
was before there were any reputation

2134
01:17:57,960 --> 01:18:02,760
ratings on eBay and yet the default

2135
01:18:00,199 --> 01:18:05,440
transaction was you describe your goods

2136
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:07,880
honestly including their flaws you set a

2137
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:10,600
reasonable price I decide to pay you

2138
01:18:07,880 --> 01:18:13,800
ship the goods and I pay you and it

2139
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:16,120
works and what happened was that eBay

2140
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:18,440
produced It produced a tremendous amount

2141
01:18:16,120 --> 01:18:20,159
of capital that was previously frozen so

2142
01:18:18,440 --> 01:18:22,520
Frozen capital is when you've invested

2143
01:18:20,159 --> 01:18:24,880
money in something but the thing is no

2144
01:18:22,520 --> 01:18:27,440
longer useful to you so the money is

2145
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:30,120
just sitting there Frozen right so to

2146
01:18:27,440 --> 01:18:32,080
speak and you can't get it Loose because

2147
01:18:30,120 --> 01:18:34,679
well you've got a attic full of junk how

2148
01:18:32,080 --> 01:18:35,960
are you going to get rid of that oh eBay

2149
01:18:34,679 --> 01:18:38,040
and so all of a sudden all these things

2150
01:18:35,960 --> 01:18:40,080
that were just junk became valuable and

2151
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:41,600
everybody got richer and none of that

2152
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:43,239
wouldn't would have happened without the

2153
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:45,840
Covenant that we established between

2154
01:18:43,239 --> 01:18:48,199
each other that's predicated on trust

2155
01:18:45,840 --> 01:18:50,400
and so you might say that trust is the

2156
01:18:48,199 --> 01:18:52,239
currency and currency is trust because

2157
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:53,679
it's a promissary note right and if

2158
01:18:52,239 --> 01:18:55,880
people lie that and the currency gets

2159
01:18:53,679 --> 01:19:00,000
debased very very rapidly and so the

2160
01:18:55,880 --> 01:19:05,000
economy runs on trust and

2161
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:05,000
so that's part of the overarching

2162
01:19:05,600 --> 01:19:10,520
Covenant so Abraham makes this Covenant

2163
01:19:08,920 --> 01:19:14,239
with God and he decides that he's going

2164
01:19:10,520 --> 01:19:16,000
to aim high and live a good life and

2165
01:19:14,239 --> 01:19:18,679
tell the truth and that puts this

2166
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:21,000
boundary around him it's like a Walled

2167
01:19:18,679 --> 01:19:22,440
Garden it's like a Walled Garden and

2168
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:24,199
inside there there's all sorts of things

2169
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:26,880
that are Happ that are complex and

2170
01:19:24,199 --> 01:19:30,199
difficult but outside there's a boundary

2171
01:19:26,880 --> 01:19:33,520
and the boundary is well maybe things

2172
01:19:30,199 --> 01:19:35,080
won't it's like God says After the flood

2173
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:36,639
he says I'll never send a flood again

2174
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:38,719
that's part of the story and so there's

2175
01:19:36,639 --> 01:19:40,600
an intimation there that no matter how

2176
01:19:38,719 --> 01:19:42,320
bad things get they won't get so bad

2177
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:44,120
that they'll be catastrophic but there's

2178
01:19:42,320 --> 01:19:48,840
a but there's a coded to that which is

2179
01:19:44,120 --> 01:19:48,840
that you have to maintain the Covenant

2180
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:54,239
and we don't know what that means you

2181
01:19:51,679 --> 01:19:56,719
know because you know you think it's

2182
01:19:54,239 --> 01:19:58,679
pretty obvious that if you treat people

2183
01:19:56,719 --> 01:20:01,440
well if you really think about it and

2184
01:19:58,679 --> 01:20:04,679
you're not being naively optimistic and

2185
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:06,920
like you know a nice good person with

2186
01:20:04,679 --> 01:20:11,120
all the weakness that that that that

2187
01:20:06,920 --> 01:20:14,800
that that uh that that Intimates if

2188
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:17,400
you're being hard-nosed and sensible you

2189
01:20:14,800 --> 01:20:19,239
understand that if you treat people if

2190
01:20:17,400 --> 01:20:20,960
you trust people that's an act of

2191
01:20:19,239 --> 01:20:23,199
Courage if you're not naive right if

2192
01:20:20,960 --> 01:20:25,480
you're naive it's an act of stupidity

2193
01:20:23,199 --> 01:20:26,760
because you might get bit and you

2194
01:20:25,480 --> 01:20:28,800
probably will and if you're naive and

2195
01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:30,880
you get bit you will suffer for it it'll

2196
01:20:28,800 --> 01:20:32,280
traumatize you but if you're not naive

2197
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:33,520
and you know you can get bit then you

2198
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:34,679
might ask well what should you do with

2199
01:20:33,520 --> 01:20:38,199
people and the answer is you should

2200
01:20:34,679 --> 01:20:39,840
trust them not because you're naive and

2201
01:20:38,199 --> 01:20:41,320
not because they couldn't betray you and

2202
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:43,960
not because you don't know that they

2203
01:20:41,320 --> 01:20:45,440
could betray you but because if you hold

2204
01:20:43,960 --> 01:20:47,159
out your hand in trust then you're

2205
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:48,679
inviting the best part of that person to

2206
01:20:47,159 --> 01:20:50,280
step forward and that won't happen

2207
01:20:48,679 --> 01:20:52,440
unless you take that initial step and

2208
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:54,480
that's courage not naivity and so to

2209
01:20:52,440 --> 01:20:56,520
trust someone once your eyes are open

2210
01:20:54,480 --> 01:21:00,840
that's an act of courage and that opens

2211
01:20:56,520 --> 01:21:00,840
up the world you know and you might say

2212
01:21:06,639 --> 01:21:11,560
okay and so there's this idea in the

2213
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:13,920
story that you can withstand it a fair

2214
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:16,679
bit of the catastrophe of Life by

2215
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:18,159
establishing the proper Covenant and by

2216
01:21:16,679 --> 01:21:20,040
acting in a trustworthy Manner and

2217
01:21:18,159 --> 01:21:22,320
extending your hand to people

2218
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:24,080
properly and you might say well okay

2219
01:21:22,320 --> 01:21:25,560
that's sensible I can understand how

2220
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:27,520
that would work and I can certainly see

2221
01:21:25,560 --> 01:21:29,600
how the opposite wouldn't work because

2222
01:21:27,520 --> 01:21:31,120
you know if I have to be absolutely

2223
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:33,400
terrified that you're going to betray me

2224
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:35,280
at every possible moment and we're in in

2225
01:21:33,400 --> 01:21:36,800
a negotiation we're not going to get any

2226
01:21:35,280 --> 01:21:39,120
work done man because I'm going to be

2227
01:21:36,800 --> 01:21:40,199
figuring out what you're up to all the

2228
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:41,600
time and you're going to be figuring out

2229
01:21:40,199 --> 01:21:43,159
what I'm up to all the time and we're

2230
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:44,120
just not going to get anywhere you'll

2231
01:21:43,159 --> 01:21:45,840
come and say you're going to do

2232
01:21:44,120 --> 01:21:47,199
something and I can just simplify you I

2233
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:49,159
can say you're going to do what you said

2234
01:21:47,199 --> 01:21:51,080
you do I don't have to worry about you

2235
01:21:49,159 --> 01:21:52,639
and then the same applies to me and then

2236
01:21:51,080 --> 01:21:54,560
we can go do something and that's how we

2237
01:21:52,639 --> 01:21:57,199
generate wealth so then you might say

2238
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:58,639
well if what's the ultimate limit of

2239
01:21:57,199 --> 01:22:00,199
that you know like we know that there's

2240
01:21:58,639 --> 01:22:02,080
corruption in our society that people

2241
01:22:00,199 --> 01:22:04,320
betray each other and there's deceit and

2242
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:06,800
all of that and it causes things like

2243
01:22:04,320 --> 01:22:08,719
the periodic collapse in 2008 which was

2244
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:12,080
complicated but was partly engendered by

2245
01:22:08,719 --> 01:22:15,120
corruption like what would be the upside

2246
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:16,600
if we acted if we really determined to

2247
01:22:15,120 --> 01:22:18,120
act honestly what do you think it is

2248
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:21,199
that people would be able to do with the

2249
01:22:18,120 --> 01:22:24,159
world if we stopped acting in a corrupt

2250
01:22:21,199 --> 01:22:26,400
manner I mean what what's the like what

2251
01:22:24,159 --> 01:22:28,639
what is the upside do you think we could

2252
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:30,639
could could how far back could we push

2253
01:22:28,639 --> 01:22:33,360
aging do you think if we hit it hard for

2254
01:22:30,639 --> 01:22:35,800
50 years could we triple our lifespan it

2255
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:38,040
wouldn't surprise me you know all these

2256
01:22:35,800 --> 01:22:39,639
terrible diseases that beset the planet

2257
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:41,920
we could get rid of them there's no

2258
01:22:39,639 --> 01:22:44,679
reason for hunger and starvation we make

2259
01:22:41,920 --> 01:22:45,920
enough food it's like what would happen

2260
01:22:44,679 --> 01:22:49,239
if we

2261
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:51,520
stopped acting badly how much better

2262
01:22:49,239 --> 01:22:52,920
could things get well you start locally

2263
01:22:51,520 --> 01:22:54,480
I think you start with yourself and you

2264
01:22:52,920 --> 01:22:56,719
start with your family but you know

2265
01:22:54,480 --> 01:22:58,800
there's intimations of the Divine

2266
01:22:56,719 --> 01:23:00,920
there's intimations of the kingdom of

2267
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:03,920
God and the Covenant with God in the Old

2268
01:23:00,920 --> 01:23:06,440
Testament it's like you think well we

2269
01:23:03,920 --> 01:23:08,600
speak secularly you think well that's an

2270
01:23:06,440 --> 01:23:11,239
unprovable assumption it's like well

2271
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:14,239
just hold on a sec what's the Assumption

2272
01:23:11,239 --> 01:23:16,600
here exactly what is the upper end for

2273
01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:18,040
Humanity I mean who's who's going to say

2274
01:23:16,600 --> 01:23:19,719
right who's going to say especially in

2275
01:23:18,040 --> 01:23:20,920
this day and age man there's so many

2276
01:23:19,719 --> 01:23:22,880
things happening that you can't even

2277
01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:25,080
comprehend them what could we do if we

2278
01:23:22,880 --> 01:23:26,440
put all of our effort into it well you

2279
01:23:25,080 --> 01:23:27,760
can experiment with that CU you can

2280
01:23:26,440 --> 01:23:30,800
start in your own household you can

2281
01:23:27,760 --> 01:23:32,679
start in your own room and you can make

2282
01:23:30,800 --> 01:23:35,120
miracles happen in the confines of your

2283
01:23:32,679 --> 01:23:36,760
own space there's no doubt about that

2284
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:38,320
all you have to do is try you'll see

2285
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:39,639
that that happens it h and people are

2286
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:40,920
writing to me and telling me that

2287
01:23:39,639 --> 01:23:44,159
they're trying this and that that's

2288
01:23:40,920 --> 01:23:44,159
exactly what's happening and

2289
01:23:44,600 --> 01:23:50,639
so so we don't want to be too cynical

2290
01:23:47,159 --> 01:23:52,800
about about where we might be headed and

2291
01:23:50,639 --> 01:23:55,320
Hagar bore Abram a son Abram called his

2292
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:57,080
son's name which Hager bear Ishmael who

2293
01:23:55,320 --> 01:23:59,480
is by tradition the forefather of

2294
01:23:57,080 --> 01:24:02,560
several Arab Nations and of Muhammad

2295
01:23:59,480 --> 01:24:05,920
himself and Abram was 4 score and6 years

2296
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:08,639
old when Hagar bear Ishmael to

2297
01:24:05,920 --> 01:24:11,719
Abram so that's the end of another story

2298
01:24:08,639 --> 01:24:13,560
and then so that section ends and then

2299
01:24:11,719 --> 01:24:16,480
again we have an encounter between

2300
01:24:13,560 --> 01:24:18,600
Abraham and God when Abraham was 90

2301
01:24:16,480 --> 01:24:20,719
years old and 9 99 years old the Lord

2302
01:24:18,600 --> 01:24:24,960
appeared to him and said I the almighty

2303
01:24:20,719 --> 01:24:24,960
God walk before me and be thou

2304
01:24:31,719 --> 01:24:38,440
perfect Alexander McLaren who was a a

2305
01:24:35,960 --> 01:24:40,280
Biblical commentator who lived in the

2306
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:43,679
early 19th century

2307
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:45,840
said this phrase walking before God is

2308
01:24:43,679 --> 01:24:48,719
Not precisely Walking with God because

2309
01:24:45,840 --> 01:24:50,840
that's what Noah did right he says it's

2310
01:24:48,719 --> 01:24:52,400
rather that of an act of Life spent in

2311
01:24:50,840 --> 01:24:54,880
continual consciousness of being named

2312
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:56,880
naked and opened before the eyes of him

2313
01:24:54,880 --> 01:24:58,600
to have whom we have to give account I

2314
01:24:56,880 --> 01:25:00,840
was pretty happy to stumble across that

2315
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:02,719
because it I mean I might have picked

2316
01:25:00,840 --> 01:25:04,679
and chosen of course you never know that

2317
01:25:02,719 --> 01:25:06,480
whether you do that but it does seem in

2318
01:25:04,679 --> 01:25:08,320
keeping with the narrative strain of the

2319
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:10,440
chapter right because what what we've

2320
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:12,840
hypothesize so far is that God has

2321
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:14,719
called Abraham and said you know get out

2322
01:25:12,840 --> 01:25:17,119
there in the world go go to where it's

2323
01:25:14,719 --> 01:25:19,199
unknown go to where you're a stranger

2324
01:25:17,119 --> 01:25:21,639
and get away from the familiar go out to

2325
01:25:19,199 --> 01:25:24,000
the unknown establish yourself and great

2326
01:25:21,639 --> 01:25:25,600
things will come but regardless of the

2327
01:25:24,000 --> 01:25:27,440
proximal evidence great things will come

2328
01:25:25,600 --> 01:25:29,320
of it and so I think that's what the

2329
01:25:27,440 --> 01:25:31,199
walking before God refers to it's not

2330
01:25:29,320 --> 01:25:32,760
like Abraham is acting in certainty

2331
01:25:31,199 --> 01:25:34,719
there's no certainty here that that's

2332
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:36,119
the act of the leap of faith even

2333
01:25:34,719 --> 01:25:37,880
because it does require a leap of faith

2334
01:25:36,119 --> 01:25:39,679
for you to move into the world because

2335
01:25:37,880 --> 01:25:41,080
the world is a catastrophe

2336
01:25:39,679 --> 01:25:44,000
self-evidently the world is a

2337
01:25:41,080 --> 01:25:46,239
catastrophe and so there's there's

2338
01:25:44,000 --> 01:25:48,480
there's every reason for you to assume

2339
01:25:46,239 --> 01:25:50,639
that you should just sit in your

2340
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:52,119
basement and hide from it but that's

2341
01:25:50,639 --> 01:25:53,679
that's not it doesn't help it doesn't

2342
01:25:52,119 --> 01:25:55,040
make make things better and the thing is

2343
01:25:53,679 --> 01:25:56,920
perhaps you're not built for that you're

2344
01:25:55,040 --> 01:25:58,520
not built to hide I don't think the

2345
01:25:56,920 --> 01:26:00,320
people are built to hide I think it

2346
01:25:58,520 --> 01:26:03,239
destroys

2347
01:26:00,320 --> 01:26:05,400
them and so walking before God in some

2348
01:26:03,239 --> 01:26:06,960
sense means that Abraham we could say is

2349
01:26:05,400 --> 01:26:08,960
taking the lead he's the person that's

2350
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:10,880
going out there into the unknown God

2351
01:26:08,960 --> 01:26:12,040
says well great things are going to

2352
01:26:10,880 --> 01:26:14,199
happen but he's a little short on

2353
01:26:12,040 --> 01:26:15,760
details that's for sure so the weight is

2354
01:26:14,199 --> 01:26:17,960
still on Abraham and that's a good thing

2355
01:26:15,760 --> 01:26:19,119
because it also that ennobles Abraham

2356
01:26:17,960 --> 01:26:21,080
right that's the other thing that's so

2357
01:26:19,119 --> 01:26:23,480
cool is that if God had just laid out

2358
01:26:21,080 --> 01:26:25,679
the whole story and and and you know

2359
01:26:23,480 --> 01:26:27,000
brushed the the the the branches from

2360
01:26:25,679 --> 01:26:28,440
Abraham's path while he was walking

2361
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:30,800
forward well then there'd be nothing for

2362
01:26:28,440 --> 01:26:32,840
Abraham to do there'd be no nobility in

2363
01:26:30,800 --> 01:26:34,560
his own Pursuit and this is another

2364
01:26:32,840 --> 01:26:36,000
thing that we don't understand very well

2365
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:38,960
it's a really tough thing to understand

2366
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:42,280
is like how much trouble would you want

2367
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:43,560
there not to be it's a weird question

2368
01:26:42,280 --> 01:26:45,719
right because you want to have something

2369
01:26:43,560 --> 01:26:48,119
to contend with you want to have

2370
01:26:45,719 --> 01:26:49,600
something that that forces from you the

2371
01:26:48,119 --> 01:26:51,400
best that you have and so you have to

2372
01:26:49,600 --> 01:26:52,920
have real problems it's something like

2373
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:55,040
that would you dispense with all your

2374
01:26:52,920 --> 01:26:57,600
real you could just lay down on a bed

2375
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:59,440
and have paum infused into your mouth

2376
01:26:57,600 --> 01:27:02,480
you know if all your problems were

2377
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:04,360
solved and so maybe you want difficult

2378
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:06,199
problems that you can solve something

2379
01:27:04,360 --> 01:27:07,679
like that because there's some I don't

2380
01:27:06,199 --> 01:27:09,520
know what it is about it there's there's

2381
01:27:07,679 --> 01:27:11,119
the overcoming and the and the growth

2382
01:27:09,520 --> 01:27:12,480
that comes along with that there's

2383
01:27:11,119 --> 01:27:13,760
something about the nobility of the

2384
01:27:12,480 --> 01:27:15,600
Enterprise you certainly see that when

2385
01:27:13,760 --> 01:27:18,000
you go about having children for example

2386
01:27:15,600 --> 01:27:19,719
which is you know the psychological

2387
01:27:18,000 --> 01:27:21,679
literature is quite clear if if you do

2388
01:27:19,719 --> 01:27:23,320
momentto moment comparisons of people

2389
01:27:21,679 --> 01:27:25,360
who have kids and people who don't have

2390
01:27:23,320 --> 01:27:28,400
kids the people who don't have kids are

2391
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:29,880
happier and so psychologists who tend to

2392
01:27:28,400 --> 01:27:32,040
get things wrong even when they make

2393
01:27:29,880 --> 01:27:34,040
intelligent discoveries like that one

2394
01:27:32,040 --> 01:27:36,920
immediately some of them jump to the

2395
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:38,920
conclusion that because happiness is the

2396
01:27:36,920 --> 01:27:41,080
goal that well there's something about

2397
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:42,600
children that you know make you unhappy

2398
01:27:41,080 --> 01:27:44,560
and that's not good it's like well wait

2399
01:27:42,600 --> 01:27:47,400
a second that maybe that's the wrong

2400
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:48,639
metric it's like of course you're less

2401
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:50,719
happy once you have children because you

2402
01:27:48,639 --> 01:27:52,199
have to worry about them you know my

2403
01:27:50,719 --> 01:27:54,199
neighbor down the street who's very

2404
01:27:52,199 --> 01:27:57,360
smart woman said to me once you can only

2405
01:27:54,199 --> 01:27:58,800
be as happy as your unhappiest child and

2406
01:27:57,360 --> 01:28:01,280
which I thought was really good you know

2407
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:02,800
that's really smart but then it isn't

2408
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:04,280
well if having children doesn't make you

2409
01:28:02,800 --> 01:28:05,960
happy the answer isn't don't have

2410
01:28:04,280 --> 01:28:08,080
children it's like don't be so stupid

2411
01:28:05,960 --> 01:28:09,920
about being happy that's the answer it's

2412
01:28:08,080 --> 01:28:11,639
because there's a nobility in the

2413
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:13,639
pursuit right and of course now you're

2414
01:28:11,639 --> 01:28:15,159
responsible you know you have a new baby

2415
01:28:13,639 --> 01:28:17,239
you think especially if you're a new

2416
01:28:15,159 --> 01:28:19,639
parent you

2417
01:28:17,239 --> 01:28:21,800
think what the hell is this and what am

2418
01:28:19,639 --> 01:28:23,719
I going to do with it you know it's like

2419
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:25,600
and and then you're you're done for the

2420
01:28:23,719 --> 01:28:27,080
rest of your life you never sleep

2421
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:29,199
properly again because you're going to

2422
01:28:27,080 --> 01:28:31,080
be worried about this creature that you

2423
01:28:29,199 --> 01:28:32,520
have to take care of but like what the

2424
01:28:31,080 --> 01:28:34,760
hell good are you if you're not doing

2425
01:28:32,520 --> 01:28:37,480
that or something else equally difficult

2426
01:28:34,760 --> 01:28:39,960
because you just you just haven't been

2427
01:28:37,480 --> 01:28:42,480
called out yet unless you take on a

2428
01:28:39,960 --> 01:28:44,400
responsibility like that the idea that

2429
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:46,040
life is you know that happiness is the

2430
01:28:44,400 --> 01:28:47,920
purpose of life it's like great for

2431
01:28:46,040 --> 01:28:50,320
happiness man if it comes along you

2432
01:28:47,920 --> 01:28:52,560
should be thrilled that it's visiting

2433
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:54,480
you but the notion that that's that

2434
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:57,400
that's what you should pursue that's

2435
01:28:54,480 --> 01:28:58,840
that's the weakest possible notion first

2436
01:28:57,400 --> 01:29:00,719
of all as soon as something terrible

2437
01:28:58,840 --> 01:29:02,360
happens to you you're done it's like

2438
01:29:00,719 --> 01:29:05,280
life is to be happy it's like well now

2439
01:29:02,360 --> 01:29:08,280
you have cancer so how's that how's the

2440
01:29:05,280 --> 01:29:11,000
happiness thing working out for you

2441
01:29:08,280 --> 01:29:12,800
now or maybe it's not you you know maybe

2442
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:14,760
it's your father that has Alzheimer's

2443
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:16,119
disease or some damn thing and you know

2444
01:29:14,760 --> 01:29:19,600
it's like it's a rare person that

2445
01:29:16,119 --> 01:29:22,000
doesn't have some catastrophe one one

2446
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:24,040
person away from them it's like life is

2447
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:26,080
to be happy it's that's not right and

2448
01:29:24,040 --> 01:29:27,480
and we can at least derive that from

2449
01:29:26,080 --> 01:29:29,360
these stories that isn't what they say

2450
01:29:27,480 --> 01:29:32,040
at all God's perfectly happy in the

2451
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:33,920
stories to Grant the people with whom he

2452
01:29:32,040 --> 01:29:36,080
forms a covenant happiness and

2453
01:29:33,920 --> 01:29:38,840
prosperity but there's never a word that

2454
01:29:36,080 --> 01:29:40,880
that's the purpose the the rule is aim

2455
01:29:38,840 --> 01:29:42,440
high and get your bloody act together

2456
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:44,080
that's the rule and establish this

2457
01:29:42,440 --> 01:29:46,159
contractual Covenant with the ultimate

2458
01:29:44,080 --> 01:29:48,199
ideal and that will see you through the

2459
01:29:46,159 --> 01:29:50,119
catastrophes and that's a much more

2460
01:29:48,199 --> 01:29:51,760
mature way of looking at life as far as

2461
01:29:50,119 --> 01:29:54,119
I'm concerned because all you have to do

2462
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:56,159
is have your eyes half open and you see

2463
01:29:54,119 --> 01:29:59,119
that the fundamental reality of life is

2464
01:29:56,159 --> 01:30:01,159
tragedy and suffering there's that's

2465
01:29:59,119 --> 01:30:04,040
inescapable the quest that doesn't mean

2466
01:30:01,159 --> 01:30:06,159
that it it makes life unbearable or that

2467
01:30:04,040 --> 01:30:08,600
it makes being something that shouldn't

2468
01:30:06,159 --> 01:30:10,600
have existed right that isn't what it

2469
01:30:08,600 --> 01:30:11,960
means but it means that you have to

2470
01:30:10,600 --> 01:30:14,320
contend with it and you have to get

2471
01:30:11,960 --> 01:30:16,199
ready and the willingness to adopt

2472
01:30:14,320 --> 01:30:18,480
responsibility for yourself and for

2473
01:30:16,199 --> 01:30:20,159
others is is the precondition for that

2474
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:21,960
and and then maybe if you do that

2475
01:30:20,159 --> 01:30:23,320
properly then now and then you get some

2476
01:30:21,960 --> 01:30:25,000
happiness you know you can sit at the

2477
01:30:23,320 --> 01:30:27,080
end of a day and you have half an hour

2478
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:28,440
where your conscience is clear and

2479
01:30:27,080 --> 01:30:29,960
there's nothing that you need to be

2480
01:30:28,440 --> 01:30:32,080
doing and you can relax and think you

2481
01:30:29,960 --> 01:30:34,520
know that that's all right things are

2482
01:30:32,080 --> 01:30:36,119
okay and thank God for that and that's

2483
01:30:34,520 --> 01:30:38,000
that's maybe where you get your

2484
01:30:36,119 --> 01:30:40,440
happiness

2485
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:43,280
so yeah that's something that's growing

2486
01:30:40,440 --> 01:30:45,520
up man obviously and and to not know

2487
01:30:43,280 --> 01:30:47,440
that and to not be taught that like

2488
01:30:45,520 --> 01:30:49,920
everyone should be taught that it's so

2489
01:30:47,440 --> 01:30:51,360
obvious we should be taught that well

2490
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:52,520
and that's partly what these biblical

2491
01:30:51,360 --> 01:30:55,040
stories

2492
01:30:52,520 --> 01:30:56,520
do and I'll make my Covenant between me

2493
01:30:55,040 --> 01:31:00,080
and thee and will multiply thee

2494
01:30:56,520 --> 01:31:03,760
exceedingly and Abram fell on his face

2495
01:31:00,080 --> 01:31:05,800
yeah and God talked with him saying as

2496
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:07,199
for me behold my Covenant is with thee

2497
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:09,360
and thou shalt be a father of many

2498
01:31:07,199 --> 01:31:11,000
nations God says this a lot to Abram

2499
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:12,880
right it's almost like he has to remind

2500
01:31:11,000 --> 01:31:14,360
him now and then and it's not surprising

2501
01:31:12,880 --> 01:31:16,119
because he keeps going through these

2502
01:31:14,360 --> 01:31:19,400
unbelievable Adventures you know that

2503
01:31:16,119 --> 01:31:21,400
are really psychologically and socially

2504
01:31:19,400 --> 01:31:23,920
shattering so it's a good thing that

2505
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:25,639
this reminder pops up in on fairly

2506
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:29,320
frequently but of course Abraham is also

2507
01:31:25,639 --> 01:31:30,320
open to it and I think what does it mean

2508
01:31:29,320 --> 01:31:33,639
you

2509
01:31:30,320 --> 01:31:35,600
know I'll talk personally for a moment I

2510
01:31:33,639 --> 01:31:37,800
guess so I've asked myself a lot of

2511
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:39,719
questions in the last eight months man I

2512
01:31:37,800 --> 01:31:41,560
can tell you that and I'm still asking

2513
01:31:39,719 --> 01:31:43,320
myself a lot of questions and I've been

2514
01:31:41,560 --> 01:31:45,440
conferring with a lot of people because

2515
01:31:43,320 --> 01:31:47,400
I had lots of people who were helping me

2516
01:31:45,440 --> 01:31:49,800
negotiate whatever the hell this is

2517
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:51,159
that's happening and you know I could

2518
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:52,560
ask them how I was doing and they would

2519
01:31:51,159 --> 01:31:53,880
tell me a bunch of of things I was doing

2520
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:55,960
wrong and some things I was doing right

2521
01:31:53,880 --> 01:31:57,400
and I could listen to them I was asking

2522
01:31:55,960 --> 01:32:01,600
questions all the time about how the

2523
01:31:57,400 --> 01:32:03,960
hell I should manage this properly and

2524
01:32:01,600 --> 01:32:06,960
you know what what I was trying to do

2525
01:32:03,960 --> 01:32:09,080
and what seemed to serve me properly was

2526
01:32:06,960 --> 01:32:11,119
to figure out how to do it correctly

2527
01:32:09,080 --> 01:32:12,719
that was the issue it's like I didn't

2528
01:32:11,119 --> 01:32:14,560
really care what happened and I guess I

2529
01:32:12,719 --> 01:32:16,040
really don't care what happens but I do

2530
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:18,119
care if I do it correctly because I

2531
01:32:16,040 --> 01:32:21,000
don't want to screw it up I don't want

2532
01:32:18,119 --> 01:32:22,800
to screw things up and that seems to be

2533
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:24,199
a reasonable goal for people I mean

2534
01:32:22,800 --> 01:32:26,320
wouldn't you like that as a goal that

2535
01:32:24,199 --> 01:32:28,040
you don't screw things up because you

2536
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:30,199
can't control too you know your life

2537
01:32:28,040 --> 01:32:32,199
isn't fully under your control by any

2538
01:32:30,199 --> 01:32:34,600
stretch of the imagination but it might

2539
01:32:32,199 --> 01:32:36,639
be nice to to not have your conscience

2540
01:32:34,600 --> 01:32:38,800
eating at you saying look you know you

2541
01:32:36,639 --> 01:32:41,760
had a big opportunity there and you

2542
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:44,920
mucked it up CU you're weak and blind

2543
01:32:41,760 --> 01:32:46,719
and you didn't listen that's no good the

2544
01:32:44,920 --> 01:32:48,560
C the catastrophy is bad enough as I

2545
01:32:46,719 --> 01:32:50,639
said without you being the bloody source

2546
01:32:48,560 --> 01:32:53,639
of it and

2547
01:32:50,639 --> 01:32:53,639
so

2548
01:32:54,920 --> 01:32:58,480
well that's Abram falling on his face I

2549
01:32:56,679 --> 01:33:01,400
guess and also communing with God it's

2550
01:32:58,480 --> 01:33:03,960
like you you don't he wants to get it

2551
01:33:01,400 --> 01:33:05,520
right he wants to get it right and

2552
01:33:03,960 --> 01:33:07,560
there's these these things that beckon

2553
01:33:05,520 --> 01:33:10,119
and promise

2554
01:33:07,560 --> 01:33:11,840
but but it's it's it's bloody easy to

2555
01:33:10,119 --> 01:33:15,119
make a catastrophic mistake and you'll

2556
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:15,119
do that in your life you know

2557
01:33:15,840 --> 01:33:19,679
and and maybe humility is one of the

2558
01:33:18,280 --> 01:33:21,280
things that can prevent that because you

2559
01:33:19,679 --> 01:33:23,080
can look and you can think okay what am

2560
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:25,119
I doing wrong what am I doing wrong what

2561
01:33:23,080 --> 01:33:28,239
can I do better how can I do this

2562
01:33:25,119 --> 01:33:30,639
properly and then maybe you know you get

2563
01:33:28,239 --> 01:33:32,239
you get you get the intimation of the

2564
01:33:30,639 --> 01:33:34,239
proper way to move forward and maybe

2565
01:33:32,239 --> 01:33:36,760
that's what protects you when things are

2566
01:33:34,239 --> 01:33:38,840
chaotic and and in strife and who knows

2567
01:33:36,760 --> 01:33:41,400
what that's

2568
01:33:38,840 --> 01:33:43,719
worth neither shall thy name anymore be

2569
01:33:41,400 --> 01:33:46,040
called Abraham which means High King if

2570
01:33:43,719 --> 01:33:48,080
I remember correctly but thy name shall

2571
01:33:46,040 --> 01:33:50,679
be Abraham for a father of many nations

2572
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:53,199
have I made thee Oh yes Abraham High

2573
01:33:50,679 --> 01:33:54,800
father look at that that Abraham means

2574
01:33:53,199 --> 01:33:57,199
father of a multitude and I will make

2575
01:33:54,800 --> 01:33:58,960
thee exceedingly fruitful and I will

2576
01:33:57,199 --> 01:34:00,600
make nations of thee productive right

2577
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:02,239
productive and that seems to be

2578
01:34:00,600 --> 01:34:03,840
something that's that's good to be I

2579
01:34:02,239 --> 01:34:05,960
mean like one of the things that I've

2580
01:34:03,840 --> 01:34:08,560
thought about

2581
01:34:05,960 --> 01:34:10,239
deeply I thought deeply about death and

2582
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:11,800
the death of my family members and about

2583
01:34:10,239 --> 01:34:13,400
funerals and I thought about it partly

2584
01:34:11,800 --> 01:34:14,639
because I had this weird experience once

2585
01:34:13,400 --> 01:34:16,719
that I think I told you about where I

2586
01:34:14,639 --> 01:34:18,719
took one of my clients to see an EMB

2587
01:34:16,719 --> 01:34:20,520
bombing which was a very strange

2588
01:34:18,719 --> 01:34:22,080
experience and I had a chance to talk to

2589
01:34:20,520 --> 01:34:24,320
the funeral director you know cuz they

2590
01:34:22,080 --> 01:34:27,119
have weird jobs you know and there's

2591
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:28,840
this idea well the Freudian idea that

2592
01:34:27,119 --> 01:34:30,840
people suffer from this terrible death

2593
01:34:28,840 --> 01:34:33,000
anxiety and there's a whole line of

2594
01:34:30,840 --> 01:34:34,560
social psychological theory theorizing

2595
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:36,560
called Terror management Theory that's

2596
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:38,639
predicated on the idea that we defend

2597
01:34:36,560 --> 01:34:40,800
ourselves against death anxiety with our

2598
01:34:38,639 --> 01:34:42,800
belief systems and like it's a pop it's

2599
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:44,360
Ernest Becker's idea he wrote the denial

2600
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:45,960
of death which is a great book but

2601
01:34:44,360 --> 01:34:47,360
there's a weakness in it because you see

2602
01:34:45,960 --> 01:34:49,040
some people who aren't like that you

2603
01:34:47,360 --> 01:34:51,199
know like emergency room nurses aren't

2604
01:34:49,040 --> 01:34:52,920
like that and paliative Care nurses

2605
01:34:51,199 --> 01:34:56,159
aren't like that my my sister-in-law is

2606
01:34:52,920 --> 01:34:57,440
a Paleo of care nurse that's a hard job

2607
01:34:56,159 --> 01:34:58,880
right because you go in there you're

2608
01:34:57,440 --> 01:35:00,760
caring for people you have and they're

2609
01:34:58,880 --> 01:35:02,199
in pain they're on their last legs

2610
01:35:00,760 --> 01:35:03,520
you're trying to make them comfortable

2611
01:35:02,199 --> 01:35:04,520
and you have a relationship with them

2612
01:35:03,520 --> 01:35:05,719
because how the hell are you going to

2613
01:35:04,520 --> 01:35:07,159
make them comfortable if you don't and

2614
01:35:05,719 --> 01:35:08,719
then they go and die on you and that

2615
01:35:07,159 --> 01:35:11,040
just happens that's what happens every

2616
01:35:08,719 --> 01:35:13,040
day right and what's weird is that

2617
01:35:11,040 --> 01:35:15,040
people can be paliative care nurses it's

2618
01:35:13,040 --> 01:35:17,239
like how do you figure that out because

2619
01:35:15,040 --> 01:35:19,560
people can actually thrive in the face

2620
01:35:17,239 --> 01:35:21,080
of death strangely enough and like these

2621
01:35:19,560 --> 01:35:22,679
Funeral Parlor directors they were

2622
01:35:21,080 --> 01:35:24,920
interested to talk to because that's all

2623
01:35:22,679 --> 01:35:28,080
they do right they just deal with they

2624
01:35:24,920 --> 01:35:29,679
deal with death and grief all the time

2625
01:35:28,080 --> 01:35:31,600
and it was very interesting talking to

2626
01:35:29,679 --> 01:35:32,880
them because I talked to two of them

2627
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:34,719
they found their job extremely

2628
01:35:32,880 --> 01:35:36,760
meaningful and I asked them well you

2629
01:35:34,719 --> 01:35:38,840
know does that what does that do to your

2630
01:35:36,760 --> 01:35:41,600
life you know you're saturated with

2631
01:35:38,840 --> 01:35:43,199
death and suffering and there and this

2632
01:35:41,600 --> 01:35:46,639
is the same answer that I got from the

2633
01:35:43,199 --> 01:35:49,719
paliative care nurses that it doesn't

2634
01:35:46,639 --> 01:35:51,400
undermine your life it enriches it now

2635
01:35:49,719 --> 01:35:52,840
who would guess that right I mean what

2636
01:35:51,400 --> 01:35:54,960
what the hell that just doesn't make any

2637
01:35:52,840 --> 01:35:57,400
sense at all but what it does is speak

2638
01:35:54,960 --> 01:35:59,520
to human possibility because God only

2639
01:35:57,400 --> 01:36:01,080
knows how tough you are you know I mean

2640
01:35:59,520 --> 01:36:02,920
if you read history and you read about

2641
01:36:01,080 --> 01:36:05,520
what people have done you think wow

2642
01:36:02,920 --> 01:36:10,239
we're pretty tough people

2643
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:11,520
are I read uh there was a shipwreck in

2644
01:36:10,239 --> 01:36:14,440
the

2645
01:36:11,520 --> 01:36:17,760
Antarctica 100 years ago or so and I

2646
01:36:14,440 --> 01:36:19,719
read the the story it was an

2647
01:36:17,760 --> 01:36:21,600
autobiography if I remember correctly of

2648
01:36:19,719 --> 01:36:23,119
the of the captain I might be wrong

2649
01:36:21,600 --> 01:36:25,280
about that but I've got the basic story

2650
01:36:23,119 --> 01:36:27,360
right well they had a shipwreck in the

2651
01:36:25,280 --> 01:36:30,760
Antarctica was then they were there for

2652
01:36:27,360 --> 01:36:32,360
a whole year in the Antarctica you know

2653
01:36:30,760 --> 01:36:34,679
and none of them died not one he didn't

2654
01:36:32,360 --> 01:36:36,600
lose a single man not one he kept them

2655
01:36:34,679 --> 01:36:38,480
morale high and then they took this boat

2656
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:41,159
that was on the ship and they crossed

2657
01:36:38,480 --> 01:36:43,960
like 400 miles of the roughest ocean the

2658
01:36:41,159 --> 01:36:45,880
roughest frigid ocean in the world right

2659
01:36:43,960 --> 01:36:48,840
you don't go in that ocean and then they

2660
01:36:45,880 --> 01:36:50,280
went to an island and they walked across

2661
01:36:48,840 --> 01:36:52,040
the island across these mountains that

2662
01:36:50,280 --> 01:36:55,199
no one else has ever

2663
01:36:52,040 --> 01:36:56,320
climbed since and they went to the city

2664
01:36:55,199 --> 01:36:57,760
on the other side of the island and they

2665
01:36:56,320 --> 01:37:00,639
got a boat and they went and rescued

2666
01:36:57,760 --> 01:37:02,520
their compatriots and everyone survived

2667
01:37:00,639 --> 01:37:05,159
it's like endurance is the name of the

2668
01:37:02,520 --> 01:37:08,000
book you read that book man you think

2669
01:37:05,159 --> 01:37:10,679
wow people are really tough you know and

2670
01:37:08,000 --> 01:37:12,960
if and it's it's ridiculous so who knows

2671
01:37:10,679 --> 01:37:15,360
how tough you are and maybe you find out

2672
01:37:12,960 --> 01:37:18,199
by going out to find out how tough you

2673
01:37:15,360 --> 01:37:20,119
are right so you take on a challenge one

2674
01:37:18,199 --> 01:37:22,239
that you think you can Master just

2675
01:37:20,119 --> 01:37:23,520
that's just a bit beyond your grasp and

2676
01:37:22,239 --> 01:37:24,880
you master it and then you're a little

2677
01:37:23,520 --> 01:37:26,679
tougher and you think hey that worked

2678
01:37:24,880 --> 01:37:28,840
out pretty well and so then you're more

2679
01:37:26,679 --> 01:37:30,159
of a monster and then you go out and you

2680
01:37:28,840 --> 01:37:31,760
find another challenge that's even

2681
01:37:30,159 --> 01:37:33,800
bigger and you think well maybe I can do

2682
01:37:31,760 --> 01:37:35,679
that too and all of a sudden you can and

2683
01:37:33,800 --> 01:37:39,320
you get a little bit bigger and God only

2684
01:37:35,679 --> 01:37:41,119
knows what the limit is of you and you

2685
01:37:39,320 --> 01:37:42,520
find out by pushing yourself against the

2686
01:37:41,119 --> 01:37:45,239
world and of course that's what Abraham

2687
01:37:42,520 --> 01:37:48,440
is doing and

2688
01:37:45,239 --> 01:37:51,239
so see we're very pessimistic us modern

2689
01:37:48,440 --> 01:37:53,800
people you know we're pessimistic about

2690
01:37:51,239 --> 01:37:56,840
Humanity that's for sure dismal wretched

2691
01:37:53,800 --> 01:37:58,960
Planet destroying cancer on the planet

2692
01:37:56,840 --> 01:38:02,400
right as the club of Rome described us

2693
01:37:58,960 --> 01:38:04,159
so pleasantly back in the 1960s you know

2694
01:38:02,400 --> 01:38:06,639
and and I don't know maybe we're ashamed

2695
01:38:04,159 --> 01:38:08,480
of the Cold War maybe we're ashamed of

2696
01:38:06,639 --> 01:38:11,000
all the destruction in the 20th century

2697
01:38:08,480 --> 01:38:13,040
and the hydrogen bomb and and the you

2698
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:14,840
know the continuing catastrophes of our

2699
01:38:13,040 --> 01:38:16,199
societies and and we're deeply ashamed

2700
01:38:14,840 --> 01:38:18,239
of that and ashamed of ourselves

2701
01:38:16,199 --> 01:38:20,119
personally but it's a hell of a thing to

2702
01:38:18,239 --> 01:38:22,239
you know call us a cancer on the planet

2703
01:38:20,119 --> 01:38:25,159
there's just no excuse for that because

2704
01:38:22,239 --> 01:38:26,840
what you do with cancer is eradicate it

2705
01:38:25,159 --> 01:38:29,320
and I don't think that that's a very

2706
01:38:26,840 --> 01:38:31,320
Noble motive

2707
01:38:29,320 --> 01:38:32,520
personally and I think it says a lot

2708
01:38:31,320 --> 01:38:34,320
about the people who would use such

2709
01:38:32,520 --> 01:38:37,360
phraseology that they would dare to

2710
01:38:34,320 --> 01:38:38,480
conceptualize Humanity in that manner

2711
01:38:37,360 --> 01:38:41,560
but you know it would be nice if we

2712
01:38:38,480 --> 01:38:42,800
could be optimistic and I think again

2713
01:38:41,560 --> 01:38:44,719
the problem with being optimistic is

2714
01:38:42,800 --> 01:38:46,480
that it's naive so then the question is

2715
01:38:44,719 --> 01:38:49,119
is there an optimism that's not naive

2716
01:38:46,480 --> 01:38:51,719
and I think there is and the optimism

2717
01:38:49,119 --> 01:38:54,560
that's not naive isn't just a

2718
01:38:51,719 --> 01:38:57,000
a a visualization of how strong people

2719
01:38:54,560 --> 01:39:00,119
can be so one of the things that I I

2720
01:38:57,000 --> 01:39:03,599
tell people I've told my students in my

2721
01:39:00,119 --> 01:39:05,880
class in maps of meeting here's a goal

2722
01:39:03,599 --> 01:39:09,480
you want to be the person at the funeral

2723
01:39:05,880 --> 01:39:11,320
of your father that everyone can rely on

2724
01:39:09,480 --> 01:39:14,520
how would that be you want to be the

2725
01:39:11,320 --> 01:39:16,440
person who's broken and and and useless

2726
01:39:14,520 --> 01:39:19,000
and adding to the misery in the corner

2727
01:39:16,440 --> 01:39:21,679
and look I'm not making light of

2728
01:39:19,000 --> 01:39:24,199
people's grief you know I'm understand

2729
01:39:21,679 --> 01:39:25,360
grief but who do you want to be when

2730
01:39:24,199 --> 01:39:27,119
there's a

2731
01:39:25,360 --> 01:39:28,800
crisis right do you want to be the

2732
01:39:27,119 --> 01:39:31,040
person that everyone can turn to for

2733
01:39:28,800 --> 01:39:33,719
strength it's like why the hell not why

2734
01:39:31,040 --> 01:39:35,040
not that as a goal that'd be a good goal

2735
01:39:33,719 --> 01:39:36,679
because then if there's a crisis then

2736
01:39:35,040 --> 01:39:38,280
there will be it won't be such a bloody

2737
01:39:36,679 --> 01:39:40,800
crisis because there'll be someone there

2738
01:39:38,280 --> 01:39:43,199
that can deal with

2739
01:39:40,800 --> 01:39:44,480
it you know so when I went and talked to

2740
01:39:43,199 --> 01:39:46,239
these people at the funeral home I

2741
01:39:44,480 --> 01:39:47,679
envisioned that I thought okay well this

2742
01:39:46,239 --> 01:39:50,440
is something you have to contend with if

2743
01:39:47,679 --> 01:39:53,280
you're going to be alive and adult you

2744
01:39:50,440 --> 01:39:55,199
have to contend with death and suffering

2745
01:39:53,280 --> 01:39:58,280
and you have to be ready for it and you

2746
01:39:55,199 --> 01:40:01,520
have to be there for the person because

2747
01:39:58,280 --> 01:40:04,040
that's all they're going to have and so

2748
01:40:01,520 --> 01:40:06,040
there's a goal man and in this time of

2749
01:40:04,040 --> 01:40:08,480
nihilism you know it's what's the point

2750
01:40:06,040 --> 01:40:10,440
of life people ask and and they're

2751
01:40:08,480 --> 01:40:11,840
taught that at universities what's the

2752
01:40:10,440 --> 01:40:14,119
point of life everything's

2753
01:40:11,840 --> 01:40:17,560
interpretation Humanity's a cancer on

2754
01:40:14,119 --> 01:40:20,119
the planet you know well how about no

2755
01:40:17,560 --> 01:40:21,300
how about not that how about that

2756
01:40:20,119 --> 01:40:36,919
there's something to

2757
01:40:21,300 --> 01:40:36,919
[Applause]

2758
01:40:40,360 --> 01:40:43,679
and I will establish my Covenant between

2759
01:40:42,040 --> 01:40:45,360
me and thee and thy seed after thee in

2760
01:40:43,679 --> 01:40:47,159
their generations for an Everlasting

2761
01:40:45,360 --> 01:40:50,199
Covenant to be a god unto thee and to

2762
01:40:47,159 --> 01:40:51,719
thy seed after thee and I will give unto

2763
01:40:50,199 --> 01:40:54,199
thee and to thy seed seed after thee the

2764
01:40:51,719 --> 01:40:55,920
land wherein thou art a stranger all of

2765
01:40:54,199 --> 01:40:58,199
the land of Canaan because of course

2766
01:40:55,920 --> 01:40:59,560
Abraham went out into the land of

2767
01:40:58,199 --> 01:41:02,760
strangers

2768
01:40:59,560 --> 01:41:05,400
right but it says that he'll Master If

2769
01:41:02,760 --> 01:41:07,840
he if he keeps his Covenant he'll Master

2770
01:41:05,400 --> 01:41:11,080
the land of strangers that's a wonderful

2771
01:41:07,840 --> 01:41:12,320
thing to know and I think a true thing

2772
01:41:11,080 --> 01:41:13,719
you know because if you're dealing with

2773
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:16,040
strangers I've dealt with lots of

2774
01:41:13,719 --> 01:41:17,560
strange people in my life but I'm a

2775
01:41:16,040 --> 01:41:18,960
clinical psychologist and that isn't to

2776
01:41:17,560 --> 01:41:21,800
say that everyone that I've dealt with

2777
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:24,320
was strange because that's not the case

2778
01:41:21,800 --> 01:41:26,920
but I have encountered some very strange

2779
01:41:24,320 --> 01:41:29,599
people and you

2780
01:41:26,920 --> 01:41:32,719
know the way to deal with strange people

2781
01:41:29,599 --> 01:41:35,000
is to you never lie to a strange person

2782
01:41:32,719 --> 01:41:37,199
that's the thing especially if they're

2783
01:41:35,000 --> 01:41:38,920
paranoid you never lie to someone who's

2784
01:41:37,199 --> 01:41:40,880
paranoid it it will come back to bite

2785
01:41:38,920 --> 01:41:43,159
you and if you're in an extreme

2786
01:41:40,880 --> 01:41:45,599
situation with someone who's very

2787
01:41:43,159 --> 01:41:49,840
unpredictable the only thing you have

2788
01:41:45,599 --> 01:41:52,040
that works is the truth that

2789
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:53,480
works

2790
01:41:52,040 --> 01:41:56,159
I'll tell you a little story this is in

2791
01:41:53,480 --> 01:41:57,920
my book so I had this landlord in

2792
01:41:56,159 --> 01:42:00,320
Montreal he lived next door to me he was

2793
01:41:57,920 --> 01:42:02,880
an ex hell's Angel's biker he'd spent a

2794
01:42:00,320 --> 01:42:04,560
lot of time in prison and his wife had

2795
01:42:02,880 --> 01:42:06,960
borderline personality disorder and she

2796
01:42:04,560 --> 01:42:09,199
committed suicide when I lived there and

2797
01:42:06,960 --> 01:42:12,159
he was a rough guy and he was a

2798
01:42:09,199 --> 01:42:15,080
kqu he spoke jeel which I could hardly

2799
01:42:12,159 --> 01:42:16,320
understand and uh he didn't really know

2800
01:42:15,080 --> 01:42:19,320
what to make of me and I didn't really

2801
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:22,159
know what to make of him um but we got

2802
01:42:19,320 --> 01:42:24,920
along you know and I was very careful

2803
01:42:22,159 --> 01:42:27,159
talking to him as as you might imagine

2804
01:42:24,920 --> 01:42:28,840
but but I I was it was very and we we

2805
01:42:27,159 --> 01:42:30,400
went over my wife and I went over there

2806
01:42:28,840 --> 01:42:32,400
and we had spaghetti dinner one night

2807
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:33,960
and we sort of communicated and I bought

2808
01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:36,159
a poster from him because he made these

2809
01:42:33,960 --> 01:42:37,440
wooden posters that had neon on them and

2810
01:42:36,159 --> 01:42:38,639
that's how he made a living he'd kind of

2811
01:42:37,440 --> 01:42:40,800
trained himself to be a bit of an

2812
01:42:38,639 --> 01:42:41,800
Electronics guy and so he made these

2813
01:42:40,800 --> 01:42:43,199
things and he was trying to quit

2814
01:42:41,800 --> 01:42:44,639
drinking and we talked about that he was

2815
01:42:43,199 --> 01:42:46,360
a lot older than me he was like 20 years

2816
01:42:44,639 --> 01:42:51,159
older than me I was about 25 at this

2817
01:42:46,360 --> 01:42:53,400
point and uh we got along pretty well

2818
01:42:51,159 --> 01:42:55,800
but every now and then he'd go out and

2819
01:42:53,400 --> 01:42:57,080
get and drink and he could really drink

2820
01:42:55,800 --> 01:42:58,960
you know like he was one of these guys

2821
01:42:57,080 --> 01:43:00,480
who could drink like 60 beer and you

2822
01:42:58,960 --> 01:43:02,679
think well no one can drink that much

2823
01:43:00,480 --> 01:43:05,480
and you're wrong I studied alcohol for

2824
01:43:02,679 --> 01:43:07,800
like 10 years some of my subjects

2825
01:43:05,480 --> 01:43:09,639
fathers drank 40 o of vodka a day and

2826
01:43:07,800 --> 01:43:11,560
had been doing it for 20 years so you

2827
01:43:09,639 --> 01:43:13,159
can drink a lot and he could drink a lot

2828
01:43:11,560 --> 01:43:14,520
and what would happen he was trying to

2829
01:43:13,159 --> 01:43:16,159
not drink but he'd go out and go on a

2830
01:43:14,520 --> 01:43:18,800
binge and then he'd be gone for like

2831
01:43:16,159 --> 01:43:21,719
three days and he'd drink up all his

2832
01:43:18,800 --> 01:43:24,080
money and then we'd hear him out in the

2833
01:43:21,719 --> 01:43:27,080
backyard howling at the moon with this

2834
01:43:24,080 --> 01:43:29,000
little little ugly dog he had you know

2835
01:43:27,080 --> 01:43:31,159
and he'd howl and the dog would howl and

2836
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:33,119
he'd howl and the dog would howl and and

2837
01:43:31,159 --> 01:43:33,880
it was rather unsettling and made my

2838
01:43:33,119 --> 01:43:36,800
wife

2839
01:43:33,880 --> 01:43:39,840
nervous

2840
01:43:36,800 --> 01:43:42,360
and and uh but worse you know now and

2841
01:43:39,840 --> 01:43:44,360
then he'd come to the door at like 3 in

2842
01:43:42,360 --> 01:43:48,119
the morning e and he'd knock on the door

2843
01:43:44,360 --> 01:43:50,040
and he'd be standing there and I don't

2844
01:43:48,119 --> 01:43:52,000
know how much experience you've had with

2845
01:43:50,040 --> 01:43:55,480
rough guys who are alcoholic and who are

2846
01:43:52,000 --> 01:43:59,599
drunk but it's they can

2847
01:43:55,480 --> 01:44:01,280
be upright and unconscious at the same

2848
01:43:59,599 --> 01:44:03,960
time and so that was the state that he

2849
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:05,639
was in you know he'd be just swaying and

2850
01:44:03,960 --> 01:44:08,440
he'd ask me if I would like to buy his

2851
01:44:05,639 --> 01:44:10,040
toaster or his microwave because he

2852
01:44:08,440 --> 01:44:11,639
needed some money to keep drinking and

2853
01:44:10,040 --> 01:44:15,000
you know I didn't really want to buy his

2854
01:44:11,639 --> 01:44:18,560
toaster or his microwave but when the ex

2855
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:21,199
Hell's Angel je all speaking 60 beard

2856
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:23,000
drunk kqu biker shows up at your door at

2857
01:44:21,199 --> 01:44:26,480
3:00 in the morning and offers you to

2858
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:28,880
sell offers to sell you his microwave

2859
01:44:26,480 --> 01:44:31,280
the easiest thing is to say I really

2860
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:31,280
need a

2861
01:44:32,920 --> 01:44:37,639
microwave

2862
01:44:34,760 --> 01:44:43,199
so so you know I bought the microwave

2863
01:44:37,639 --> 01:44:45,960
and toaster and some other things but

2864
01:44:43,199 --> 01:44:49,520
then but then my wife talked to me and

2865
01:44:45,960 --> 01:44:51,040
she liked my landlord you know even

2866
01:44:49,520 --> 01:44:54,119
though she was afraid of him she liked

2867
01:44:51,040 --> 01:44:56,679
him and and she said you can't buy any

2868
01:44:54,119 --> 01:45:00,960
more any more appliances because it's

2869
01:44:56,679 --> 01:45:03,520
not good for him and I thought huh

2870
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:05,199
that's an interesting problem you know

2871
01:45:03,520 --> 01:45:08,080
so what the hell am I going to do about

2872
01:45:05,199 --> 01:45:09,520
this because no I don't want to buy your

2873
01:45:08,080 --> 01:45:13,040
microwave just doesn't seem to be the

2874
01:45:09,520 --> 01:45:16,520
right answer at 3 in the morning

2875
01:45:13,040 --> 01:45:19,239
so so one time he took me out on his 750

2876
01:45:16,520 --> 01:45:21,080
Honda and he put me on the back of it he

2877
01:45:19,239 --> 01:45:23,320
wanted to show me his layer I guess his

2878
01:45:21,080 --> 01:45:25,000
Hangouts and I got his wife's helmet on

2879
01:45:23,320 --> 01:45:28,239
but it didn't fit it just sit on the top

2880
01:45:25,000 --> 01:45:31,560
of my head and he said I got on the bike

2881
01:45:28,239 --> 01:45:35,639
and he said if the cops chase us we're

2882
01:45:31,560 --> 01:45:37,599
not stopping and then and then away we

2883
01:45:35,639 --> 01:45:39,920
went and we went to these like these

2884
01:45:37,599 --> 01:45:41,599
bars downtown on S law they were very

2885
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:44,280
rough places and he got into like four

2886
01:45:41,599 --> 01:45:46,719
fights that night because he was a rough

2887
01:45:44,280 --> 01:45:47,800
guy you know and these kind of punk guys

2888
01:45:46,719 --> 01:45:49,760
would come up to him and sort of

2889
01:45:47,800 --> 01:45:51,440
challenge him and act stupidly around

2890
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:53,440
him and he was very skeptical and if you

2891
01:45:51,440 --> 01:45:55,320
were acting stupidly around him for any

2892
01:45:53,440 --> 01:45:56,840
length of time he' just hid you because

2893
01:45:55,320 --> 01:45:59,440
he felt that that's what you deserved

2894
01:45:56,840 --> 01:46:02,199
and perhaps he was right you know so so

2895
01:45:59,440 --> 01:46:06,440
I had firsthand opportunity to observe

2896
01:46:02,199 --> 01:46:07,760
him so anyways he sure enough about a

2897
01:46:06,440 --> 01:46:09,639
week or two after we had this

2898
01:46:07,760 --> 01:46:11,960
conversation he showed up at the door

2899
01:46:09,639 --> 01:46:13,280
knock knock knock you know open the door

2900
01:46:11,960 --> 01:46:15,679
and he was standing there you know with

2901
01:46:13,280 --> 01:46:18,199
his eyes kind of half closed and he was

2902
01:46:15,679 --> 01:46:19,960
swaying and he had I don't remember what

2903
01:46:18,199 --> 01:46:23,440
the appliance was this time but he

2904
01:46:19,960 --> 01:46:27,520
wanted to sell it to me and I

2905
01:46:23,440 --> 01:46:29,000
said I'm not Paul I can't buy this I'm

2906
01:46:27,520 --> 01:46:31,599
not going to buy this because I know

2907
01:46:29,000 --> 01:46:32,800
you're trying to quit drinking and if I

2908
01:46:31,599 --> 01:46:35,360
give you this money then you're going to

2909
01:46:32,800 --> 01:46:37,000
go and drink it up and it's not going to

2910
01:46:35,360 --> 01:46:40,440
be good for you

2911
01:46:37,000 --> 01:46:43,000
and what else did I tell him I think I

2912
01:46:40,440 --> 01:46:44,880
told him as well that this whole thing

2913
01:46:43,000 --> 01:46:47,000
of him coming to my house at like 2 in

2914
01:46:44,880 --> 01:46:49,040
the morning was scaring my wife who he

2915
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:51,080
liked and that it had to stop and

2916
01:46:49,040 --> 01:46:54,360
believe me man I I was thinking about

2917
01:46:51,080 --> 01:46:57,159
what I was saying cuz he was watching me

2918
01:46:54,360 --> 01:47:00,000
like a rough guy watches you and a rough

2919
01:46:57,159 --> 01:47:03,639
guy watches you like this he thinks if

2920
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:05,880
you say one thing that indicates

2921
01:47:03,639 --> 01:47:08,560
contempt you're going to bloody well pay

2922
01:47:05,880 --> 01:47:11,000
for it and so I was finding my words

2923
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:12,920
like you know I was crossing a swamp and

2924
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:15,840
trying to look for the for the Rocks

2925
01:47:12,920 --> 01:47:17,920
underneath the surface and I said what I

2926
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:21,000
had to say very very carefully and he

2927
01:47:17,920 --> 01:47:23,840
looked at me for about 15 seconds and

2928
01:47:21,000 --> 01:47:25,480
that's a long time to be looked at at

2929
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:27,639
3:00 in the

2930
01:47:25,480 --> 01:47:30,119
morning and he

2931
01:47:27,639 --> 01:47:33,599
left and he never came back to sell me

2932
01:47:30,119 --> 01:47:35,800
anything again and we got along fine but

2933
01:47:33,599 --> 01:47:38,679
that's a good illustration of

2934
01:47:35,800 --> 01:47:42,800
this issue with regards

2935
01:47:38,679 --> 01:47:45,239
to truth and success in The Strange Land

2936
01:47:42,800 --> 01:47:49,800
because I was in The Strange Land when I

2937
01:47:45,239 --> 01:47:54,239
was talking to my neighbor my landlord

2938
01:47:49,800 --> 01:47:56,119
then and I managed to say what was true

2939
01:47:54,239 --> 01:47:59,280
carefully enough so despite the fact

2940
01:47:56,119 --> 01:48:01,960
that he was a very violent person and

2941
01:47:59,280 --> 01:48:03,360
that he was a very intoxicated person

2942
01:48:01,960 --> 01:48:05,040
and that he had every reason to be

2943
01:48:03,360 --> 01:48:07,360
suspicious of me and we couldn't

2944
01:48:05,040 --> 01:48:12,159
communicate very well and I didn't do

2945
01:48:07,360 --> 01:48:15,199
what he wanted that he took it and he

2946
01:48:12,159 --> 01:48:19,840
left and there was no problem and life

2947
01:48:15,199 --> 01:48:22,880
went on just fine after that and so we

2948
01:48:19,840 --> 01:48:25,440
don't want to underestimate the utility

2949
01:48:22,880 --> 01:48:27,760
of establishing this bounded

2950
01:48:25,440 --> 01:48:31,239
relationship with the ideal and

2951
01:48:27,760 --> 01:48:34,000
attempting to live with some nobility in

2952
01:48:31,239 --> 01:48:36,239
truth while aiming at the highest ideal

2953
01:48:34,000 --> 01:48:38,119
there's nothing about that that's

2954
01:48:36,239 --> 01:48:41,480
anything

2955
01:48:38,119 --> 01:48:44,719
but strengthening and

2956
01:48:41,480 --> 01:48:47,440
positive and it's exactly what you need

2957
01:48:44,719 --> 01:48:51,000
to set against the catastrophe and

2958
01:48:47,440 --> 01:48:53,520
uncertainty of life and as far as I can

2959
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:56,280
tell that's what these abrahamic stories

2960
01:48:53,520 --> 01:48:56,280
are attempting

2961
01:48:56,599 --> 01:49:01,940
to

2962
01:48:58,679 --> 01:49:12,820
communicate so we'll stop there thank

2963
01:49:01,940 --> 01:49:12,820
[Applause]

2964
01:49:19,119 --> 01:49:22,119
you

2965
01:49:28,040 --> 01:49:33,920
I have to make an announcement I'm going

2966
01:49:29,760 --> 01:49:37,760
to do a talk August 22nd I think not

2967
01:49:33,920 --> 01:49:43,000
sure of the date but I'll I'll find out

2968
01:49:37,760 --> 01:49:46,800

2969
01:49:43,000 --> 01:49:49,560
so and with a with an ex social worker

2970
01:49:46,800 --> 01:49:51,119
named Serena Singh and with faith Goldie

2971
01:49:49,560 --> 01:49:54,159
I think faith is going to be there as

2972
01:49:51,119 --> 01:49:56,800
well so the tickets for that will go on

2973
01:49:54,159 --> 01:49:58,920
sale I'm not hosting this someone else

2974
01:49:56,800 --> 01:50:00,360
is dealing with it but the tickets for

2975
01:49:58,920 --> 01:50:02,480
that will go on sale within

2976
01:50:00,360 --> 01:50:05,040
approximately a week and I'll post that

2977
01:50:02,480 --> 01:50:06,880
on my I'll probably make an announcement

01:50:05,040 --> 01:50:11,239
on YouTube but I'll twit Twitter it

2979
01:50:06,880 --> 01:50:12,920
Twitter it and all of that so and I

2980
01:50:11,239 --> 01:50:15,040
think I mentioned to you guys last week

2981
01:50:12,920 --> 01:50:16,520
that I would like to continue this

2982
01:50:15,040 --> 01:50:18,800
series but I think I'll do it once a

2983
01:50:16,520 --> 01:50:20,599
month and I'll try to do it in this

2984
01:50:18,800 --> 01:50:22,400
theater but I haven't got

2985
01:50:20,599 --> 01:50:24,040
word from the people who run the theater

2986
01:50:22,400 --> 01:50:25,599
that's the university whether or not

2987
01:50:24,040 --> 01:50:29,199
it'll be accessible but I'll figure

2988
01:50:25,599 --> 01:50:30,800
something out and so oh hi Serena Serena

2989
01:50:29,199 --> 01:50:34,520

uh oh there's a special freedom of

2995
01:50:47,119 --> 01:50:50,440
speech edition of the Hemingways

2996

3000
01:50:59,480 --> 01:51:03,760
okay so that's it for announcements I

3001
01:51:01,480 --> 01:51:05,400
guess and then let's say for questions

3002
01:51:03,760 --> 01:51:07,119
yes I was going to let you ask the first

3003
01:51:05,400 --> 01:51:10,199
question last time wasn't I okay so I

3004
01:51:07,119 --> 01:51:11,920
will do that and so let's make sure

3005
01:51:10,199 --> 01:51:14,159
again everybody to speak into the mic

3006
01:51:11,920 --> 01:51:17,599
clearly so that the YouTube people can

3007
01:51:14,159 --> 01:51:21,560
hear and uh you know the ghostly YouTube

3008
01:51:17,599 --> 01:51:22,560
people and and so go ahead question I

3009
01:51:21,560 --> 01:51:24,920
was quite impressed with your

3010
01:51:22,560 --> 01:51:26,440
presentation last week and uh I wasn't

3011
01:51:24,920 --> 01:51:28,920
quite sure where it was going at one

3012
01:51:26,440 --> 01:51:31,400
point and would neither neither was

3013
01:51:28,920 --> 01:51:33,320
sry and that's okay because at one point

3014
01:51:31,400 --> 01:51:34,880
I I listened and I thought what you

3015
01:51:33,320 --> 01:51:37,159
basically were talking about this is

3016
01:51:34,880 --> 01:51:38,840
what I saw you were embodying mind body

3017
01:51:37,159 --> 01:51:41,239
and spirit and bringing it all together

3018
01:51:38,840 --> 01:51:42,760
as one and you touch on it a bit tonight

3019
01:51:41,239 --> 01:51:44,440
when you when you talk about truth this

3020
01:51:42,760 --> 01:51:46,199
is where we need to go right and I know

3021
01:51:44,440 --> 01:51:48,320
you say be positive and all that and

3022
01:51:46,199 --> 01:51:50,000
yeah that's right I agree it's scary

3023
01:51:48,320 --> 01:51:52,520
what's going on right now however we

3024
01:51:50,000 --> 01:51:53,880
have the power to stay in the positive

3025
01:51:52,520 --> 01:51:55,760
what you talked about last week you

3026
01:51:53,880 --> 01:51:58,000
talked about using our intuition which I

3027
01:51:55,760 --> 01:52:00,239
consider our higher self using

3028
01:51:58,000 --> 01:52:02,560
Consciousness and you made reference I

3029
01:52:00,239 --> 01:52:05,520
can't remember exactly what you what you

3030
01:52:02,560 --> 01:52:07,679
said but you held your hand and uh you

3031
01:52:05,520 --> 01:52:10,360
talked about emotions and bringing

3032
01:52:07,679 --> 01:52:12,480
intellect on top and when you said

3033
01:52:10,360 --> 01:52:13,920
emotions everything just lit up for me

3034
01:52:12,480 --> 01:52:15,760
because I'm thinking that's our heart

3035
01:52:13,920 --> 01:52:17,840
chakra that's what combines our lower

3036
01:52:15,760 --> 01:52:20,239
self our physical being the material

3037
01:52:17,840 --> 01:52:22,800
stuff all the all the stuff that doesn't

3038
01:52:20,239 --> 01:52:24,360
really motivate us with our higher self

3039
01:52:22,800 --> 01:52:26,079
and when when you talked about emotion I

3040
01:52:24,360 --> 01:52:28,440
want to talk about the emotion of love

3041
01:52:26,079 --> 01:52:30,440
and I find so many people are terrified

3042
01:52:28,440 --> 01:52:32,239
it's a four-letter word I know but it

3043
01:52:30,440 --> 01:52:34,199
doesn't have to be bad okay so I

3044
01:52:32,239 --> 01:52:36,159
remember why when I talked to you last

3045
01:52:34,199 --> 01:52:39,440
week why I wanted you to ask this

3046
01:52:36,159 --> 01:52:43,760
question so okay so I've talked a lot in

3047
01:52:39,440 --> 01:52:45,920
this lecture series about truth and know

3048
01:52:43,760 --> 01:52:47,560
I think there's a battle in the biblical

3049
01:52:45,920 --> 01:52:49,679
stories all the way through between love

3050
01:52:47,560 --> 01:52:52,239
and truth in terms of their Primacy and

3051
01:52:49,679 --> 01:52:54,840
so So and I've concentrated a lot on

3052
01:52:52,239 --> 01:52:56,599
truth in my own thinking but I and it's

3053
01:52:54,840 --> 01:52:58,400
hard to talk about love because it's a

3054
01:52:56,599 --> 01:52:59,760
word that people have mouth to death you

3055
01:52:58,400 --> 01:53:01,520
know as soon as you start talking about

3056
01:52:59,760 --> 01:53:03,520
love then people should just go into a

3057
01:53:01,520 --> 01:53:05,440
different room and and not listen to you

3058
01:53:03,520 --> 01:53:08,880
you know because it it gets it can get

3059
01:53:05,440 --> 01:53:11,000
sappy and new Agy just like that and and

3060
01:53:08,880 --> 01:53:12,880
I don't like that at all but but it's

3061
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:16,239
still something that has to be contended

3062
01:53:12,880 --> 01:53:17,840
with and I think so I've been trying to

3063
01:53:16,239 --> 01:53:20,440
conceptualize let's say what this

3064
01:53:17,840 --> 01:53:23,679
Covenant might might con Institute and I

3065
01:53:20,440 --> 01:53:25,920
think the love part so here's this so

3066
01:53:23,679 --> 01:53:29,159
you know there's this book by Gira

3067
01:53:25,920 --> 01:53:31,239
called fa and it's in two volumes f one

3068
01:53:29,159 --> 01:53:34,480
and F two logically enough one was

3069
01:53:31,239 --> 01:53:37,119
written much later than the other and Fa

3070
01:53:34,480 --> 01:53:39,840
basically sells the soul to the devil

3071
01:53:37,119 --> 01:53:41,760
for for knowledge and the devil in FA is

3072
01:53:39,840 --> 01:53:43,920
mephistophiles and mephistophiles is

3073
01:53:41,760 --> 01:53:47,320
quite a well-developed character and

3074
01:53:43,920 --> 01:53:49,480
Gira has mephesto say what he's about

3075
01:53:47,320 --> 01:53:52,960
which is really quite cool so it's like

3076
01:53:49,480 --> 01:53:55,560
the adversary of the world evil itself

3077
01:53:52,960 --> 01:53:57,119
gets a chance to speak and make its case

3078
01:53:55,560 --> 01:53:58,760
and Gira thought this was so important

3079
01:53:57,119 --> 01:54:02,159
that he actually had mephistophiles

3080
01:53:58,760 --> 01:54:04,360
announce himself once in FA one and then

3081
01:54:02,159 --> 01:54:07,239
using the same words you know phrased

3082
01:54:04,360 --> 01:54:09,239
differently again in in part two and it

3083
01:54:07,239 --> 01:54:12,320
really struck me it really struck me and

3084
01:54:09,239 --> 01:54:16,599
so what mephistophiles says is

3085
01:54:12,320 --> 01:54:18,960
that the world is such a Charter House

3086
01:54:16,599 --> 01:54:20,639
of suffering and destruction that it

3087
01:54:18,960 --> 01:54:23,400
would be better if it never

3088
01:54:20,639 --> 01:54:26,880
existed and so that what he's working to

3089
01:54:23,400 --> 01:54:29,000
is to bring existence to an end because

3090
01:54:26,880 --> 01:54:31,639
it is not justified by its

3091
01:54:29,000 --> 01:54:33,280
suffering it's like that's it's an

3092
01:54:31,639 --> 01:54:35,360
argument very similar to the argument

3093
01:54:33,280 --> 01:54:40,679
that made by

3094
01:54:35,360 --> 01:54:42,639
Ivan cam camarat of thank you thank

3095
01:54:40,679 --> 01:54:44,400
Russians e you can't pronounce them or

3096
01:54:42,639 --> 01:54:47,520
live with them you

3097
01:54:44,400 --> 01:54:49,480
can't but he basically he's an atheist

3098
01:54:47,520 --> 01:54:51,320
and does a very good job of detailing

3099
01:54:49,480 --> 01:54:53,159
out The Atheist argument or maybe an

3100
01:54:51,320 --> 01:54:53,840
anti-theist argument and he's arguing

3101
01:54:53,159 --> 01:54:56,920
with

3102
01:54:53,840 --> 01:54:58,880
his his brother alosa who's a mon

3103
01:54:56,920 --> 01:55:00,800
monastic noviciate who's a very good guy

3104
01:54:58,880 --> 01:55:02,920
but not an intellect Ivan's an intellect

3105
01:55:00,800 --> 01:55:04,840
and a very powerful one and he basically

3106
01:55:02,920 --> 01:55:07,679
tells alosha

3107
01:55:04,840 --> 01:55:09,560
that the all of the cosmos isn't worth

3108
01:55:07,679 --> 01:55:11,840
the suffering of one child he tells this

3109
01:55:09,560 --> 01:55:14,760
story about this and this dovi took this

3110
01:55:11,840 --> 01:55:16,360
from a newspaper about this parents that

3111
01:55:14,760 --> 01:55:19,440
locked their four-year-old daughter in

3112
01:55:16,360 --> 01:55:22,199
an ouse overnight and she screamed about

3113
01:55:19,440 --> 01:55:24,400
it until she froze to death and so dovi

3114
01:55:22,199 --> 01:55:26,679
used that argument he tied that into

3115
01:55:24,400 --> 01:55:28,719
Ivan's anti-theist argument against

3116
01:55:26,679 --> 01:55:31,639
elosha it's very very powerful argument

3117
01:55:28,719 --> 01:55:34,400
the brothers katsov is an absolutely

3118
01:55:31,639 --> 01:55:38,239
mindboggling amazing book I would highly

3119
01:55:34,400 --> 01:55:40,800
recommend it um and so that's the meilan

3120
01:55:38,239 --> 01:55:42,520
perspective mopan perspection is

3121
01:55:40,800 --> 01:55:44,360
perspective is that being itself is so

3122
01:55:42,520 --> 01:55:47,199
corrupt that it shouldn't

3123
01:55:44,360 --> 01:55:49,199
exist so then you think okay well that

3124
01:55:47,199 --> 01:55:51,400
fair enough that's a decent argument

3125
01:55:49,199 --> 01:55:53,360
it's understandable but the problem

3126
01:55:51,400 --> 01:55:55,360
comes when you try to implement that and

3127
01:55:53,360 --> 01:55:57,199
what happens when you implement it as

3128
01:55:55,360 --> 01:55:59,239
far as I can tell you adopt that me

3129
01:55:57,199 --> 01:56:01,040
meilan attitude of bitterness and

3130
01:55:59,239 --> 01:56:02,199
resentment and destruction is that you

3131
01:56:01,040 --> 01:56:04,360
make all the suffering that you're

3132
01:56:02,199 --> 01:56:06,719
complaining about far worse I think

3133
01:56:04,360 --> 01:56:08,520
that's what happened at the base of

3134
01:56:06,719 --> 01:56:11,280
things in the 20th century is that there

3135
01:56:08,520 --> 01:56:14,360
was a powerful movement among human

3136
01:56:11,280 --> 01:56:15,639
Humanity to bring being itself to a halt

3137
01:56:14,360 --> 01:56:18,280
you know what culminated in the

3138
01:56:15,639 --> 01:56:21,040
development of the hydrogen bomb and and

3139
01:56:18,280 --> 01:56:23,159
the high probability for many at many

3140
01:56:21,040 --> 01:56:25,760
periods of time that we were going to do

3141
01:56:23,159 --> 01:56:27,400
something permanent and fatal which

3142
01:56:25,760 --> 01:56:29,440
seems like a bad idea it seems like a

3143
01:56:27,400 --> 01:56:31,639
bad idea so what's the opposite of the

3144
01:56:29,440 --> 01:56:34,239
mephistophelian attitude and I think the

3145
01:56:31,639 --> 01:56:36,040
opposite of that is what's presented in

3146
01:56:34,239 --> 01:56:41,440
the biblical stories in the guise of

3147
01:56:36,040 --> 01:56:43,679
love and that is the wish that things

3148
01:56:41,440 --> 01:56:45,639
would be good it's something like that

3149
01:56:43,679 --> 01:56:47,520
that's what love is I think is that it's

3150
01:56:45,639 --> 01:56:49,719
the attempt to orient yourself towards

3151
01:56:47,520 --> 01:56:52,000
making things better and it it's

3152
01:56:49,719 --> 01:56:54,679
predicated on something like a deep

3153
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:56,960
appreciation for being def despite its

3154
01:56:54,679 --> 01:56:59,239
suffering and deficiencies and maybe a

3155
01:56:56,960 --> 01:57:01,560
decision that you're going to act to

3156
01:56:59,239 --> 01:57:04,119
bring about things to move things

3157
01:57:01,560 --> 01:57:06,239
towards the good and I think that's the

3158
01:57:04,119 --> 01:57:07,960
thing that sets the parameters of the of

3159
01:57:06,239 --> 01:57:11,159
the aim it's it's the opposite of the

3160
01:57:07,960 --> 01:57:12,880
mephistophelian attitude it's like to

3161
01:57:11,159 --> 01:57:14,199
work towards the betterment of being

3162
01:57:12,880 --> 01:57:16,000
because you've decided that you're going

3163
01:57:14,199 --> 01:57:18,199
to open your heart to existence

3164
01:57:16,000 --> 01:57:20,840
something like that and it's within that

3165
01:57:18,199 --> 01:57:23,119
framework that truth takes place I think

3166
01:57:20,840 --> 01:57:25,199
because truth has to serve something it

3167
01:57:23,119 --> 01:57:27,199
can can serve truth but it has to be

3168
01:57:25,199 --> 01:57:29,639
bounded inside something and I think

3169
01:57:27,199 --> 01:57:31,320
that that's what it's bounded inside so

3170
01:57:29,639 --> 01:57:33,520
what I what I was going to refer to with

3171
01:57:31,320 --> 01:57:35,440
that was um David Hawkins wrote power

3172
01:57:33,520 --> 01:57:37,199
versus force and he put it on a

3173
01:57:35,440 --> 01:57:38,760
quantifiable scale all different

3174
01:57:37,199 --> 01:57:42,280
emotions he called it Consciousness and

3175
01:57:38,760 --> 01:57:44,199
he put love at 528 Hertz he put shame at

3176
01:57:42,280 --> 01:57:47,639
20 I'm not sure if I've got these 100%

3177
01:57:44,199 --> 01:57:49,119
right um guilt I think at 30 fear at 50

3178
01:57:47,639 --> 01:57:51,480
and it shows you how far the people who

3179
01:57:49,119 --> 01:57:52,679
are really knocked down have to get to

3180
01:57:51,480 --> 01:57:55,360
love and I'm thinking if we could

3181
01:57:52,679 --> 01:57:56,400
quantify love on a term it means

3182
01:57:55,360 --> 01:57:58,679
different things to everybody and

3183
01:57:56,400 --> 01:58:00,760
rightly so but can we get to that

3184
01:57:58,679 --> 01:58:02,760
frequency and if you look at the sesia

3185
01:58:00,760 --> 01:58:04,960
notes you know the musical notes have

3186
01:58:02,760 --> 01:58:06,560
you I'm I'm I'm afraid I'm G to I'm

3187
01:58:04,960 --> 01:58:08,239
going to ask you to stop if you would

3188
01:58:06,560 --> 01:58:13,040
because I should I should go to another

3189
01:58:08,239 --> 01:58:13,040
question if you thank you very much okay

3190
01:58:18,320 --> 01:58:23,639
let's so you've been an educator through

3191
01:58:21,119 --> 01:58:25,159
the rise of the smartphone and my

3192
01:58:23,639 --> 01:58:28,159
question basically relates to

3193
01:58:25,159 --> 01:58:31,679
procrastination and task delay needless

3194
01:58:28,159 --> 01:58:33,639
task delay specifically and given the

3195
01:58:31,679 --> 01:58:35,639
unprecedented level of distraction that

3196
01:58:33,639 --> 01:58:37,760
we have in today's world I just wanted

3197
01:58:35,639 --> 01:58:40,480
to get your perspective from a

3198
01:58:37,760 --> 01:58:42,520
psychological standpoint on other than

3199
01:58:40,480 --> 01:58:44,480
cleaning your damn room what would you

3200
01:58:42,520 --> 01:58:47,320
suggest to a student who's looking to

3201
01:58:44,480 --> 01:58:47,320
overcome these

3202
01:58:47,960 --> 01:58:52,639
things well I think with any let's call

3203
01:58:50,719 --> 01:58:55,239
it addictive

3204
01:58:52,639 --> 01:58:57,520
process I mean email is powerfully

3205
01:58:55,239 --> 01:58:59,239
addictive right partly it's it's a slot

3206
01:58:57,520 --> 01:59:01,960
machine and and I mean that technically

3207
01:58:59,239 --> 01:59:03,760
so when you pull it's that's a variable

3208
01:59:01,960 --> 01:59:05,520
ratio reinforcement schedule if I

3209
01:59:03,760 --> 01:59:06,560
remember correctly and it's very

3210
01:59:05,520 --> 01:59:08,880
addictive

3211
01:59:06,560 --> 01:59:12,760
because if you pull on the slot machine

3212
01:59:08,880 --> 01:59:16,560
arm enough you will win and you never

3213
01:59:12,760 --> 01:59:17,960
know which pull will reward you and so

3214
01:59:16,560 --> 01:59:21,520
not only is that addictive it's very

3215
01:59:17,960 --> 01:59:24,119
hard to extinguish that and

3216
01:59:21,520 --> 01:59:25,440
so emails like that because there's

3217
01:59:24,119 --> 01:59:28,400
always something beckoning and now and

3218
01:59:25,440 --> 01:59:30,440
then it's a jackpot and social media is

3219
01:59:28,400 --> 01:59:34,000
like that because you know people are

3220
01:59:30,440 --> 01:59:35,800
posting interesting things and so well

3221
01:59:34,000 --> 01:59:38,040
how do you overcome an addictive process

3222
01:59:35,800 --> 01:59:39,239
and partly you do it by replacing it

3223
01:59:38,040 --> 01:59:41,360
with something

3224
01:59:39,239 --> 01:59:44,119
better right

3225
01:59:41,360 --> 01:59:45,880
so when people study drug and alcohol

3226
01:59:44,119 --> 01:59:47,840
use they they often make an elementary

3227
01:59:45,880 --> 01:59:50,239
mistake which is to try to figure out

3228
01:59:47,840 --> 01:59:54,280
why people use drugs and alcohol that's

3229
01:59:50,239 --> 01:59:57,560
that's not a smart thing to wonder we

3230
01:59:54,280 --> 02:00:00,760
know why people use cocaine cocaine

3231
01:59:57,560 --> 02:00:03,079
directly stimulates the systems that

3232
02:00:00,760 --> 02:00:04,840
produce positive emotion it's like so

3233
02:00:03,079 --> 02:00:07,320
there's no mystery there the mystery

3234
02:00:04,840 --> 02:00:08,880
with cocaine is very very simple why

3235
02:00:07,320 --> 02:00:11,320
don't people take cocaine all the time

3236
02:00:08,880 --> 02:00:13,560
until they die that's the mystery really

3237
02:00:11,320 --> 02:00:16,760
because you can get isolated rats to do

3238
02:00:13,560 --> 02:00:18,400
that so and and for some people alcohol

3239
02:00:16,760 --> 02:00:20,199
has the same kind of effect except it's

3240
02:00:18,400 --> 02:00:22,280
mediated by op

3241
02:00:20,199 --> 02:00:23,760
but often what people have to do to get

3242
02:00:22,280 --> 02:00:26,040
themselves out of an addictive process

3243
02:00:23,760 --> 02:00:28,679
is to find something better to do to

3244
02:00:26,040 --> 02:00:30,480
replace it and so I would say the

3245
02:00:28,679 --> 02:00:33,079
problem with the gadgets and I mean

3246
02:00:30,480 --> 02:00:36,320
they're amazing things is that they

3247
02:00:33,079 --> 02:00:38,880
interfere with they approximately

3248
02:00:36,320 --> 02:00:41,040
interfere with medium to long-term goals

3249
02:00:38,880 --> 02:00:42,400
I would say and so I think the first

3250
02:00:41,040 --> 02:00:44,599
thing you have to do to bring them under

3251
02:00:42,400 --> 02:00:46,400
control is figure out what it is that

3252
02:00:44,599 --> 02:00:47,800
their use is interfering with it has to

3253
02:00:46,400 --> 02:00:49,440
be something important right so you

3254
02:00:47,800 --> 02:00:52,119
think well I I I want want to do

3255
02:00:49,440 --> 02:00:53,560
something important what is that well

3256
02:00:52,119 --> 02:00:55,639
could be personal maybe you want to have

3257
02:00:53,560 --> 02:00:57,480
a relationship you want to get married

3258
02:00:55,639 --> 02:00:59,159
you want to have kids you want to have a

3259
02:00:57,480 --> 02:01:00,920
career that's meaningful you know you

3260
02:00:59,159 --> 02:01:03,159
want to have a life you you want to have

3261
02:01:00,920 --> 02:01:04,920
an abrahamic adventure and be the father

3262
02:01:03,159 --> 02:01:06,719
of Nations let's say well you can't be

3263
02:01:04,920 --> 02:01:10,040
ratting away on your cell phone and

3264
02:01:06,719 --> 02:01:13,639
doing that and so I think I think part

3265
02:01:10,040 --> 02:01:15,560
of it is to set your sights high and and

3266
02:01:13,639 --> 02:01:19,800
make a plan and figure out who you could

3267
02:01:15,560 --> 02:01:22,440
be and see if obsessive you utilization

3268
02:01:19,800 --> 02:01:24,679
of smartphone fits into that vision of

3269
02:01:22,440 --> 02:01:26,280
nobility and it will partly because

3270
02:01:24,679 --> 02:01:29,280
they're they're unbelievably powerful

3271
02:01:26,280 --> 02:01:32,000
communication devices but so so often

3272
02:01:29,280 --> 02:01:35,520
it's it's for lack of something better

3273
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:38,679
to do and it also interferes so that's

3274
02:01:35,520 --> 02:01:38,679
about the best I can do with

3275
02:01:43,880 --> 02:01:49,960
that hello Dr Peterson so uh you've been

3276
02:01:48,520 --> 02:01:51,760
um you you've been talking with some of

3277
02:01:49,960 --> 02:01:53,520
the conservative uh candidates for

3278
02:01:51,760 --> 02:01:55,599
leadership this year um I know you

3279
02:01:53,520 --> 02:01:57,960
talked with most all of them right not

3280
02:01:55,599 --> 02:01:59,520
all of them but a number of them you you

3281
02:01:57,960 --> 02:02:02,440
talked with Andrew though right yes I

3282
02:01:59,520 --> 02:02:04,360
did yeah so um so something very

3283
02:02:02,440 --> 02:02:07,000
interesting uh popped up in my Facebook

3284
02:02:04,360 --> 02:02:11,520
feed so it was a ad for the conservative

3285
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:14,159
party and um it was suggesting that we

3286
02:02:11,520 --> 02:02:16,079
uh cut you cut uh funding to public

3287
02:02:14,159 --> 02:02:17,840
universities that don't support free

3288
02:02:16,079 --> 02:02:21,159
speech and yeah that was probably my

3289
02:02:17,840 --> 02:02:23,000
fault yeah see precisely because because

3290
02:02:21,159 --> 02:02:25,239
this is something you say in some of

3291
02:02:23,000 --> 02:02:27,760
your Wilder moments you suggest that we

3292
02:02:25,239 --> 02:02:30,520
should cut the universities funding by

3293
02:02:27,760 --> 02:02:33,360
25% and let them battle it out for the

3294
02:02:30,520 --> 02:02:35,360
remains and he's taken that to you know

3295
02:02:33,360 --> 02:02:38,079
his his platform but now what you're

3296
02:02:35,360 --> 02:02:39,440
doing is uh well you're well one of the

3297
02:02:38,079 --> 02:02:42,800
things you're doing is you've created

3298
02:02:39,440 --> 02:02:46,400
this website um that identifies uh the

3299
02:02:42,800 --> 02:02:48,599
postmodern lexicon and helps people um

3300
02:02:46,400 --> 02:02:50,360
uh distinguish between uh postmodern

3301
02:02:48,599 --> 02:02:53,599
courses and not and so people don't take

3302
02:02:50,360 --> 02:02:56,639
them um or take them if they want yeah

3303
02:02:53,599 --> 02:02:58,360
yeah so that's it's it'd be interesting

3304
02:02:56,639 --> 02:03:00,199
to know like what sort of malevolent

3305
02:02:58,360 --> 02:03:04,520
postmodernists just study you

3306
02:03:00,199 --> 02:03:07,520
meticulously and try to use all your uh

3307
02:03:04,520 --> 02:03:09,599
knowledge of it anyway so but but what

3308
02:03:07,520 --> 02:03:11,159
you've said though you said that um what

3309
02:03:09,599 --> 02:03:15,079
we need to do is starve it out from the

3310
02:03:11,159 --> 02:03:17,159
source yeah okay so I yeah that look so

3311
02:03:15,079 --> 02:03:19,239
yeah I do I know where you're going so

3312
02:03:17,159 --> 02:03:21,040
about two weeks ago 3 weeks ago I went

3313
02:03:19,239 --> 02:03:22,520
up to Northern saskat and my parents

3314
02:03:21,040 --> 02:03:25,000
have a cottage up there it's way the

3315
02:03:22,520 --> 02:03:26,560
hell out in the middle of nowhere and uh

3316
02:03:25,000 --> 02:03:28,280
there's no cell phone although we do

3317
02:03:26,560 --> 02:03:31,000
have internet now which is you know

3318
02:03:28,280 --> 02:03:32,800
probably bad and good but anyways I got

3319
02:03:31,000 --> 02:03:34,560
to take a bit of a break which was good

3320
02:03:32,800 --> 02:03:37,119
because I haven't really been able to

3321
02:03:34,560 --> 02:03:39,159
think because you know more broadly

3322
02:03:37,119 --> 02:03:40,320
about say what I'm doing because who the

3323
02:03:39,159 --> 02:03:43,599
hell I don't know what the hell I'm

3324
02:03:40,320 --> 02:03:46,880
doing exactly this is a this is all very

3325
02:03:43,599 --> 02:03:48,040
strange and but but one thing I thought

3326
02:03:46,880 --> 02:03:50,559
about I was out on the lake I was

3327
02:03:48,040 --> 02:03:53,880
canoeing around and I I thought I'd

3328
02:03:50,559 --> 02:03:57,000
thought about war you know because I was

3329
02:03:53,880 --> 02:03:58,320
very irritated I'm very irritated about

3330
02:03:57,000 --> 02:04:00,559
what's happened to the

3331
02:03:58,320 --> 02:04:03,199
universities and there's a hint of

3332
02:04:00,559 --> 02:04:07,520
malevolence about it and I I'm not a fan

3333
02:04:03,199 --> 02:04:10,199
of ideological possession and I've been

3334
02:04:07,520 --> 02:04:14,000
set back up on my heels a lot over the

3335
02:04:10,199 --> 02:04:17,440
last eight months by the the onslaught

3336
02:04:14,000 --> 02:04:19,559
of what emerged when I said that there

3337
02:04:17,440 --> 02:04:23,440
was words I wouldn't say

3338
02:04:19,559 --> 02:04:25,559
and so it's put me into a defensive

3339
02:04:23,440 --> 02:04:28,360
posture let's say and I had been

3340
02:04:25,559 --> 02:04:30,040
thinking in terms of War metaphors you

3341
02:04:28,360 --> 02:04:32,599
know

3342
02:04:30,040 --> 02:04:34,480
like this is a Battleground and that

3343
02:04:32,599 --> 02:04:37,920
there's a war going on an ideological

3344
02:04:34,480 --> 02:04:42,639
war and I do believe that that's true

3345
02:04:37,920 --> 02:04:44,280
but then I was reading and I I did this

3346
02:04:42,639 --> 02:04:45,599
partly for this course I was reading The

3347
02:04:44,280 --> 02:04:48,960
Sermon on the Mount and one of the

3348
02:04:45,599 --> 02:04:51,800
things it says is resist not evil and I

3349
02:04:48,960 --> 02:04:53,360
don't know what to make of that line and

3350
02:04:51,800 --> 02:04:55,679
so I was talking to a bunch of people

3351
02:04:53,360 --> 02:04:57,239
about it reading about it a lot and

3352
02:04:55,679 --> 02:05:00,320
trying to figure out what it meant and

3353
02:04:57,239 --> 02:05:01,840
partly what it means is don't waste time

3354
02:05:00,320 --> 02:05:03,000
right because when you're fighting

3355
02:05:01,840 --> 02:05:05,760
against something then there's something

3356
02:05:03,000 --> 02:05:07,040
else you're not doing and then I thought

3357
02:05:05,760 --> 02:05:08,320
also when I was out there on the lake I

3358
02:05:07,040 --> 02:05:11,079
thought well do I really want to be in a

3359
02:05:08,320 --> 02:05:15,320
war because War that's not that's

3360
02:05:11,079 --> 02:05:17,400
not that's not uh that's not heaven

3361
02:05:15,320 --> 02:05:19,400
that's for sure it's really stressful

3362
02:05:17,400 --> 02:05:21,119
and people get hurt

3363
02:05:19,400 --> 02:05:22,679
and so I thought well maybe that's just

3364
02:05:21,119 --> 02:05:25,559
the wrong way of thinking about it even

3365
02:05:22,679 --> 02:05:29,119
though there's a Battleground issue here

3366
02:05:25,559 --> 02:05:30,320
and I thought well wait a second maybe

3367
02:05:29,119 --> 02:05:33,400
maybe the right thing to do in a

3368
02:05:30,320 --> 02:05:35,040
situation like this and this is maybe

3369
02:05:33,400 --> 02:05:36,880
something that those on the alt right

3370
02:05:35,040 --> 02:05:39,360
might consider is

3371
02:05:36,880 --> 02:05:41,760
that you the right thing to do maybe is

3372
02:05:39,360 --> 02:05:44,639
to outline A Better

3373
02:05:41,760 --> 02:05:47,320
Way rather than go out directly on the

3374
02:05:44,639 --> 02:05:49,679
attack now that might be seem somewhat

3375
02:05:47,320 --> 02:05:51,520
at odds with my idea of the website and

3376
02:05:49,679 --> 02:05:54,000
perhaps it is somewhat at odds with that

3377
02:05:51,520 --> 02:05:57,000
I'm I'm not sure about that but what I'm

3378
02:05:54,000 --> 02:05:59,840
trying to do instead of conducting this

3379
02:05:57,000 --> 02:06:03,679
like a war let's say is to conduct it

3380
02:05:59,840 --> 02:06:05,639
like a movement towards something better

3381
02:06:03,679 --> 02:06:07,119
and and that would be better now with

3382
02:06:05,639 --> 02:06:08,880
regards to cutting the University's

3383
02:06:07,119 --> 02:06:10,199
funding I thought about that too and I

3384
02:06:08,880 --> 02:06:12,239
thought wait a second that's not going

3385
02:06:10,199 --> 02:06:14,159
to work out because it's inviting

3386
02:06:12,239 --> 02:06:16,800
political interference into higher

3387
02:06:14,159 --> 02:06:19,239
education now the political interference

3388
02:06:16,800 --> 02:06:20,840
might be of the counterbalancing because

3389
02:06:19,239 --> 02:06:23,480
the evidence that the humanities in

3390
02:06:20,840 --> 02:06:26,199
particular have tilted almost 100% to

3391
02:06:23,480 --> 02:06:28,639
the left is overwhelming and so maybe

3392
02:06:26,199 --> 02:06:30,239
some counterbalance from the right would

3393
02:06:28,639 --> 02:06:31,840
set things more towards the middle but

3394
02:06:30,239 --> 02:06:34,320
the problem is is when you open up the

3395
02:06:31,840 --> 02:06:36,639
door to political interference with

3396
02:06:34,320 --> 02:06:40,480
higher education content you can't close

3397
02:06:36,639 --> 02:06:42,320
the door again and so on reflection I

3398
02:06:40,480 --> 02:06:44,920
thought that it probably was a

3399
02:06:42,320 --> 02:06:47,239
suboptimal idea and that would be better

3400
02:06:44,920 --> 02:06:48,760
instead was to and what this is what I

3401
02:06:47,239 --> 02:06:50,559
want to do when I launched the website I

3402
02:06:48,760 --> 02:06:52,000
want to ask students the students who

3403
02:06:50,559 --> 02:06:53,800
will be using it's like what do you want

3404
02:06:52,000 --> 02:06:55,719
from University CU here's here's your

3405
02:06:53,800 --> 02:06:58,599
options you can you can come out

3406
02:06:55,719 --> 02:07:01,559
ideologically possessed right you can

3407
02:06:58,599 --> 02:07:03,800
buy this Doctrine this pathological

3408
02:07:01,559 --> 02:07:05,599
Doctrine and you can become bitter and

3409
02:07:03,800 --> 02:07:07,239
resentful and you won't learn to

3410
02:07:05,599 --> 02:07:09,800
communicate properly and you won't read

3411
02:07:07,239 --> 02:07:12,040
the great works of civilization and you

3412
02:07:09,800 --> 02:07:16,280
won't learn to think and write you it

3413
02:07:12,040 --> 02:07:18,800
won't become Noble in body and

3414
02:07:16,280 --> 02:07:20,159
spirit is that what you want or do you

3415
02:07:18,800 --> 02:07:22,360
want the opposite do you want a real

3416
02:07:20,159 --> 02:07:23,719
education and and then I want to explain

3417
02:07:22,360 --> 02:07:25,040
what that means like I did tonight to

3418
02:07:23,719 --> 02:07:27,320
some degree you know that there's

3419
02:07:25,040 --> 02:07:28,920
absolute value in learning how to put

3420
02:07:27,320 --> 02:07:32,000
yourself together and to communicate and

3421
02:07:28,920 --> 02:07:34,119
to familiarize yourself with with with

3422
02:07:32,000 --> 02:07:35,719
the classic works of civilization and I

3423
02:07:34,119 --> 02:07:37,719
want to offer that I want to do what I

3424
02:07:35,719 --> 02:07:40,119
can to offer that as the proper

3425
02:07:37,719 --> 02:07:42,360
alternative instead of staying ins

3426
02:07:40,119 --> 02:07:44,440
sconed in this notion of a battle which

3427
02:07:42,360 --> 02:07:47,119
is just I just don't think it's the

3428
02:07:44,440 --> 02:07:48,760
right metaphor so I don't either and Dr

3429
02:07:47,119 --> 02:07:50,079
Peterson I just want to say that I think

3430
02:07:48,760 --> 02:07:52,400
what you're doing is absolutely

3431
02:07:50,079 --> 02:07:54,520
miraculous it helps change my life and

3432
02:07:52,400 --> 02:07:56,840
I'm sure at least raise your hand if Dr

3433
02:07:54,520 --> 02:08:00,480
Peterson has helped change your

3434
02:07:56,840 --> 02:08:02,960
life so for the better or for the

3435
02:08:00,480 --> 02:08:05,280
worse ask him to look at it well it's

3436
02:08:02,960 --> 02:08:07,440
about it's about 40 people maybe and

3437
02:08:05,280 --> 02:08:10,000
that's miraculous you know and I think

3438
02:08:07,440 --> 02:08:11,480
and and your thinking is going to be

3439
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:13,679
it's going to be it's going to be all

3440
02:08:11,480 --> 02:08:15,719
over the place in the Canadian election

3441
02:08:13,679 --> 02:08:18,760
into years and I think that God that's a

3442
02:08:15,719 --> 02:08:21,119
horrible thing to contemplate you you to

3443
02:08:18,760 --> 02:08:23,320
watch out for it buddy and you need and

3444
02:08:21,119 --> 02:08:27,639
and and there's there's going to be a

3445
02:08:23,320 --> 02:08:30,719
lot of talk about how um how how uh

3446
02:08:27,639 --> 02:08:32,760
Andrew Shear's uh political message is

3447
02:08:30,719 --> 02:08:35,639
going to stem from yours and I think

3448
02:08:32,760 --> 02:08:37,639
it's really important that he he doesn't

3449
02:08:35,639 --> 02:08:40,599
censor himself like other conservative

3450
02:08:37,639 --> 02:08:43,480
politicians are doing and and because I

3451
02:08:40,599 --> 02:08:47,480
don't know we we we need to unite under

3452
02:08:43,480 --> 02:08:49,239
a a valid thoughtful articulate

3453
02:08:47,480 --> 02:08:52,199
conservative voice and what do we have

3454
02:08:49,239 --> 02:08:54,719
now we have we have Trump that's what's

3455
02:08:52,199 --> 02:08:57,239
you know we we we don't have any we

3456
02:08:54,719 --> 02:09:00,079
don't have any strong articulate male

3457
02:08:57,239 --> 02:09:01,599
voices in our in our um in our political

3458
02:09:00,079 --> 02:09:03,840
discourse right now that's what it feels

3459
02:09:01,599 --> 02:09:08,800
it's definitely time for you to develop

3460
02:09:03,840 --> 02:09:08,800
one so looks like you're on the right

3461
02:09:11,239 --> 02:09:15,639
path hello hello Dr Peterson uh thank

be succinct I have I have two comments

3468
02:09:27,079 --> 02:09:30,320
and one question okay my first comment

3469
02:09:28,760 --> 02:09:32,360
is you mentioned how you were prevented

3470
02:09:30,320 --> 02:09:34,599
from uploading your YouTube video uh

3471
02:09:32,360 --> 02:09:35,960
from last week yeah um I actually attend

3472
02:09:34,599 --> 02:09:37,679
that lecture and I make pretty detailed

3473
02:09:35,960 --> 02:09:39,639
notes so if you want maybe I can email

3474
02:09:37,679 --> 02:09:43,400

3477
02:09:47,400 --> 02:09:51,119
it's okay it's it's straightened out and

3478
02:09:48,920 --> 02:09:52,840
I'm going to upload all the videos to a

3479
02:09:51,119 --> 02:09:54,559
bunch of other sites and so this isn't

3480
02:09:52,840 --> 02:09:56,320
going to happen again so but I

3481
02:09:54,559 --> 02:09:57,639
appreciate that I actually miss some

3482
02:09:56,320 --> 02:10:01,079
lectures and I do want to look at them

3483
02:09:57,639 --> 02:10:03,119
online uh my second comment is about um

3484
02:10:01,079 --> 02:10:04,760
um sort of kind of going into the

3485
02:10:03,119 --> 02:10:06,360
commentaries of Christian theologist

3486
02:10:04,760 --> 02:10:09,960
over over the centuries uh like you've

3487
02:10:06,360 --> 02:10:11,760
done yourself um I just would like to

3488
02:10:09,960 --> 02:10:13,920
encourage everybody to also look at not

3489
02:10:11,760 --> 02:10:15,559
just Western Christianity but also

3490
02:10:13,920 --> 02:10:17,400
Eastern Christianity like the Orthodox

3491
02:10:15,559 --> 02:10:19,599
writings uh there's a big difference

3492
02:10:17,400 --> 02:10:21,920
between the two and that that the

3493
02:10:19,599 --> 02:10:25,320
Western sort of theology comes out of

3494
02:10:21,920 --> 02:10:27,079
the Roman uh uh Roman law Roman justice

3495
02:10:25,320 --> 02:10:29,599
so there's a lot more of an emphasis on

3496
02:10:27,079 --> 02:10:31,280
kind of justice and Christ came he died

3497
02:10:29,599 --> 02:10:33,880
on the cross for our sin so there's that

3498
02:10:31,280 --> 02:10:35,800
kind of like legal uh payback you know

3499
02:10:33,880 --> 02:10:40,040
what I mean right whereas the Eastern

3500
02:10:35,800 --> 02:10:42,679
the Eastern theology is a lot more

3501
02:10:40,040 --> 02:10:44,639
um like it it focuses a lot more on love

3502
02:10:42,679 --> 02:10:46,760
and on sort of the uh the positive

3503
02:10:44,639 --> 02:10:48,480
aspects and if you do read like the

3504
02:10:46,760 --> 02:10:50,599
first four centuries of Christianity

3505
02:10:48,480 --> 02:10:52,840
where there was no Schism uh there's

3506
02:10:50,599 --> 02:10:55,559
very little mention of like a sort of uh

3507
02:10:52,840 --> 02:10:58,599
legalistic framework it's a lot more I

3508
02:10:55,559 --> 02:11:00,079
don't know a pric or more um heartfelt I

3509
02:10:58,599 --> 02:11:03,040
guess so I think it's important that we

3510
02:11:00,079 --> 02:11:05,960
also in the west look at the Eastern

3511
02:11:03,040 --> 02:11:09,320
counterpart um especially more so now

3512
02:11:05,960 --> 02:11:11,119
because I I do perceive a lot of fake

3513
02:11:09,320 --> 02:11:12,679
love as being at the center of this

3514
02:11:11,119 --> 02:11:14,639
malevolence that you mentioned so like

3515
02:11:12,679 --> 02:11:16,920
you know this whole thing about um

3516
02:11:14,639 --> 02:11:18,960
demonizing the opposition saying that

3517
02:11:16,920 --> 02:11:20,400
they're they hard they have no love this

3518
02:11:18,960 --> 02:11:23,800
and that I perceive that as a lot of

3519
02:11:20,400 --> 02:11:25,559
fake love um and I think that we have to

3520
02:11:23,800 --> 02:11:27,520
keep in mind what true love is sometimes

3521
02:11:25,559 --> 02:11:29,400
it looks ugly like in dealing with

3522
02:11:27,520 --> 02:11:31,880
psychiatric patients maybe like other

3523
02:11:29,400 --> 02:11:33,800
countries are not as liberal as Canada

3524
02:11:31,880 --> 02:11:35,159
but they get results a lot more often

3525
02:11:33,800 --> 02:11:36,800
you don't say as many psychiatric

3526
02:11:35,159 --> 02:11:40,800
patients on on the road for example in

3527
02:11:36,800 --> 02:11:42,280
Greece where I'm from so yeah that was

3528
02:11:40,800 --> 02:11:44,280
kind of my comment that we need to focus

3529
02:11:42,280 --> 02:11:46,360
a lot more on what real love is I think

3530
02:11:44,280 --> 02:11:48,199
and not just the uh the kind of love

3531
02:11:46,360 --> 02:11:49,159
that you can put on a scale cuz I I

3532
02:11:48,199 --> 02:11:51,280
don't think that you can put love on a

3533
02:11:49,159 --> 02:11:53,719
scale so I've been talking as some of

3534
02:11:51,280 --> 02:11:55,840
you know to this guy Jonathan Paso who's

3535
02:11:53,719 --> 02:11:58,159
a an orthodox Carver and he started a

3536
02:11:55,840 --> 02:12:00,239
YouTube channel and he's talking a lot

3537
02:11:58,159 --> 02:12:02,040
about Orthodox issues and I'm pretty

3538
02:12:00,239 --> 02:12:05,280
ignorant when it comes to Orthodox

3539
02:12:02,040 --> 02:12:07,559
Christianity um but from what I

3540
02:12:05,280 --> 02:12:10,920
understand of it so far there's plenty

3541
02:12:07,559 --> 02:12:12,760
to be learned so yeah I I'm Orthodox

3542
02:12:10,920 --> 02:12:15,199
myself uh I just recently came back to

3543
02:12:12,760 --> 02:12:16,840
my faith two years ago um basically that

3544
02:12:15,199 --> 02:12:19,679
was the original Christianity then there

3545
02:12:16,840 --> 02:12:22,320
was a Schism of 1 54 between East and

3546
02:12:19,679 --> 02:12:24,679
West because of the uh uh the conflicts

3547
02:12:22,320 --> 02:12:27,000
that these new Christian Christians have

3548
02:12:24,679 --> 02:12:28,840
with a pope and then after that you also

3549
02:12:27,000 --> 02:12:30,440
had theism intern within the West

3550
02:12:28,840 --> 02:12:32,199
between Catholicism and and the

3551
02:12:30,440 --> 02:12:34,280
Protestants so that's kind of like the

3552
02:12:32,199 --> 02:12:35,800
big difference that Christianity

3553
02:12:34,280 --> 02:12:37,599
actually actually came from the East so

3554
02:12:35,800 --> 02:12:39,280
I think that's why it's important that

3555
02:12:37,599 --> 02:12:40,880
we look at the most ancient tags because

3556
02:12:39,280 --> 02:12:44,079
those were the ones that were closest to

3557
02:12:40,880 --> 02:12:46,280
the original message um so not to my

3558
02:12:44,079 --> 02:12:48,679
question

3559
02:12:46,280 --> 02:12:50,559
um it's about atheism

3560
02:12:48,679 --> 02:12:52,760
um you might hear a lot of times people

3561
02:12:50,559 --> 02:12:55,800
criticizing uh anybody that has any sort

3562
02:12:52,760 --> 02:12:57,199
of belief in in a deity or a god um that

3563
02:12:55,800 --> 02:13:00,440
uh you're just somebody that has an

3564
02:12:57,199 --> 02:13:03,079
imaginary friend um you know like the

3565
02:13:00,440 --> 02:13:05,079
the heavenly father that you have to uh

3566
02:13:03,079 --> 02:13:08,520
adhere to that you have no will of your

3567
02:13:05,079 --> 02:13:10,239
own so then I there's also like wouldn't

3568
02:13:08,520 --> 02:13:12,079
the cont argument be

3569
02:13:10,239 --> 02:13:13,760
that okay so if I have a good

3570
02:13:12,079 --> 02:13:16,079
relationship with my father and that's

3571
02:13:13,760 --> 02:13:18,239
why I'm more likely to accept a higher

3572
02:13:16,079 --> 02:13:21,239
deity than could it be that you as an a

3573
02:13:18,239 --> 02:13:23,440
IST um maybe you have conflict with your

3574
02:13:21,239 --> 02:13:25,480
father and that's why you're ad adverse

3575
02:13:23,440 --> 02:13:29,320
to kind of submitting to a higher being

3576
02:13:25,480 --> 02:13:31,719
that um that kind of dictates your life

3577
02:13:29,320 --> 02:13:34,760
well you're you're you're attempting a

3578
02:13:31,719 --> 02:13:38,559
psychoanalysis of atheism you know and

3579
02:13:34,760 --> 02:13:41,719
and there's many factors that go into

3580
02:13:38,559 --> 02:13:43,960
atheism um I would say that you could

3581
02:13:41,719 --> 02:13:48,040
make that case in some situations but

3582
02:13:43,960 --> 02:13:49,320
not in all um I do think though and I I

3583
02:13:48,040 --> 02:13:52,520
think this is perhaps where your

3584
02:13:49,320 --> 02:13:58,239
question is stemming from is that it's

3585
02:13:52,520 --> 02:14:00,800
no fluke that at the same time

3586
02:13:58,239 --> 02:14:03,199
that one of the consequences of the

3587
02:14:00,800 --> 02:14:06,559
death of God that n announced back in

3588
02:14:03,199 --> 02:14:08,199
the 1800s is the allout assault on

3589
02:14:06,559 --> 02:14:11,520
masculinity that's occurring in our

3590
02:14:08,199 --> 02:14:14,040
culture now and those things are

3591
02:14:11,520 --> 02:14:15,840
associated and I do think that does have

3592
02:14:14,040 --> 02:14:18,559
to do with a lack of faith in the

3593
02:14:15,840 --> 02:14:21,320
masculine spirit and that's a very bad

3594
02:14:18,559 --> 02:14:24,679
thing because well it's a bad thing for

3595
02:14:21,320 --> 02:14:27,320
everyone obviously because women have a

3596
02:14:24,679 --> 02:14:30,920
partially masculine spirit and they have

3597
02:14:27,320 --> 02:14:33,280
to put up with men and so to demolish

3598
02:14:30,920 --> 02:14:36,159
that or to fail to nurture it which is

3599
02:14:33,280 --> 02:14:42,360
certainly what's occurring is just a

3600
02:14:36,159 --> 02:14:42,360
pathway to Absolute disaster so

3601
02:14:46,040 --> 02:14:50,199
Y Peterson so this is the type of

3602
02:14:48,840 --> 02:14:52,520
question that you hate because it's in

3603
02:14:50,199 --> 02:14:54,840
the category of why why you believe what

3604
02:14:52,520 --> 02:14:56,599
you believe and uh it's a type of

3605
02:14:54,840 --> 02:14:58,199
question that uh makes you say I have it

3606
02:14:56,599 --> 02:14:59,400
right from the last time quote what the

3607
02:14:58,199 --> 02:15:01,679
hell makes you think it's any of your

3608
02:14:59,400 --> 02:15:03,760
business so I'm going to try to try to

3609
02:15:01,679 --> 02:15:05,719
frame it properly okay and I'm asking

3610
02:15:03,760 --> 02:15:07,040
this at lecture 10 of 12 and after

3611
02:15:05,719 --> 02:15:09,639
having listened to quite a few hours of

3612
02:15:07,040 --> 02:15:11,159
you here and elsewhere okay and in so in

3613
02:15:09,639 --> 02:15:12,760
your second interview with transliminal

3614
02:15:11,159 --> 02:15:14,000
media you lay out a few things I have

3615
02:15:12,760 --> 02:15:16,040
some quotes here I'll skip them for

3616
02:15:14,000 --> 02:15:18,040
brevity you get to the point where

3617
02:15:16,040 --> 02:15:20,920
you're discussing the embodiment of the

3618
02:15:18,040 --> 02:15:23,079
logos by Christ as a historical figure

3619
02:15:20,920 --> 02:15:26,840
and then you say quote is his

3620
02:15:23,079 --> 02:15:29,599
resurrection real did his body resurrect

3621
02:15:26,840 --> 02:15:30,840
I don't know in today's lecture you you

3622
02:15:29,599 --> 02:15:32,440
you alluded to the fact that there are

3623
02:15:30,840 --> 02:15:34,400
states of Consciousness that perhaps we

3624
02:15:32,440 --> 02:15:36,400
don't know how to access anymore and

3625
02:15:34,400 --> 02:15:37,639
let's say that I'm with you there let's

3626
02:15:36,400 --> 02:15:39,079
say I'm with the idea that there are

3627
02:15:37,639 --> 02:15:40,960
unknown there are unknown ways to get

3628
02:15:39,079 --> 02:15:42,760
intimations of the Divine that the

3629
02:15:40,960 --> 02:15:44,960
embodiment of the logos is associated

3630
02:15:42,760 --> 02:15:46,360
with physiological Transformations the

3631
02:15:44,960 --> 02:15:48,280
upper limits of which are unknown and

3632
02:15:46,360 --> 02:15:50,360
that we might currently classify as

3633
02:15:48,280 --> 02:15:52,800
paranormal but to dumb it right back

3634
02:15:50,360 --> 02:15:54,599
down to my level I'm asking about the

3635
02:15:52,800 --> 02:15:56,880
guy commonly depicted with long hair

3636
02:15:54,599 --> 02:15:58,520
nailed to a cross until de is a doorknob

3637
02:15:56,880 --> 02:16:00,520
and all of this goes to the heart of the

3638
02:15:58,520 --> 02:16:02,360
question of literalism and religious

3639
02:16:00,520 --> 02:16:03,400
interpretation it goes to the heart of

3640
02:16:02,360 --> 02:16:05,400
kind of you know what we're doing here

3641
02:16:03,400 --> 02:16:06,840
at this lecture series are we examining

3642
02:16:05,400 --> 02:16:08,599
the psychological significance of these

3643
02:16:06,840 --> 02:16:10,320
stories or are we entertaining the

3644
02:16:08,599 --> 02:16:11,760
possibility of these Fantastical events

3645
02:16:10,320 --> 02:16:14,239
I might be struggling with the concept

3646
02:16:11,760 --> 02:16:16,520
but I I haven't been able to square away

3647
02:16:14,239 --> 02:16:18,159
and reconcile those statements by you so

3648
02:16:16,520 --> 02:16:20,079
the question is on the on the question

3649
02:16:18,159 --> 02:16:22,320
of the resurrection of Christ why is

3650
02:16:20,079 --> 02:16:24,360
your answer to your own question I don't

3651
02:16:22,320 --> 02:16:26,760
know instead of at the very least

3652
02:16:24,360 --> 02:16:26,760
probably

3653
02:16:29,760 --> 02:16:34,920
not well you're definitely right about

3654
02:16:32,000 --> 02:16:34,920
me hating that

3655
02:16:40,920 --> 02:16:45,319
question well I call this series the

3656
02:16:43,639 --> 02:16:47,319
psychological significance of the

3657
02:16:45,319 --> 02:16:49,040
biblical stories for a reason you know

3658
02:16:47,319 --> 02:16:50,599
and the reason was

3659
02:16:49,040 --> 02:16:54,760
that

3660
02:16:50,599 --> 02:16:59,120
I'm harshly qualified to talk about such

3661
02:16:54,760 --> 02:16:59,120
things when I step outside of

3662
02:16:59,519 --> 02:17:07,359
that then I'm not where I should

3663
02:17:03,679 --> 02:17:07,359
be I don't think

3664
02:17:10,280 --> 02:17:15,120
that see I don't think that this is I'm

3665
02:17:13,679 --> 02:17:17,719
not going to get this right I can't get

3666
02:17:15,120 --> 02:17:20,559
the words exactly right this isn't about

3667
02:17:17,719 --> 02:17:23,000
what I believe personally it's partly

3668
02:17:20,559 --> 02:17:24,960
because I don't know what I believe I

3669
02:17:23,000 --> 02:17:26,639
don't know what I believe the world's a

3670
02:17:24,960 --> 02:17:29,120
very strange place I've had some very

3671
02:17:26,639 --> 02:17:32,040
strange experiences in

3672
02:17:29,120 --> 02:17:35,479
it I don't think it's helpful for me to

3673
02:17:32,040 --> 02:17:36,880
to step outside my my jurisdiction and

3674
02:17:35,479 --> 02:17:41,519
speculate

3675
02:17:36,880 --> 02:17:41,519
precisely the easiest thing would be to

3676
02:17:43,160 --> 02:17:47,240
say I think I said what I had to say

3677
02:17:45,639 --> 02:17:50,359
today I don't think that we know what

3678
02:17:47,240 --> 02:17:52,319
the up ER limits of human possibility

3679
02:17:50,359 --> 02:17:54,200
are I don't know what that means

3680
02:17:52,319 --> 02:17:57,120
metaphysically what I do understand from

3681
02:17:54,200 --> 02:17:59,439
the gospels is that even the accounts of

3682
02:17:57,120 --> 02:18:02,120
Christ's Resurrection are complex and

3683
02:17:59,439 --> 02:18:02,120
difficult to

3684
02:18:02,160 --> 02:18:07,880
understand I think from Reading yung in

3685
02:18:05,840 --> 02:18:09,679
large part that you can make a very

3686
02:18:07,880 --> 02:18:11,639
strong case for the symbolic meaning of

3687
02:18:09,679 --> 02:18:13,840
the death and Resurrection I think it

3688
02:18:11,639 --> 02:18:16,880
does stand for the capacity of the human

3689
02:18:13,840 --> 02:18:19,040
logos to die and resurrect continually

3690
02:18:16,880 --> 02:18:21,280
as it stries

3691
02:18:19,040 --> 02:18:24,439
upward I'm not willing to say that

3692
02:18:21,280 --> 02:18:28,080
that's all it means because I don't know

3693
02:18:24,439 --> 02:18:30,000
what everything means and I don't know

3694
02:18:28,080 --> 02:18:32,359
about the fundamental metaphysics of

3695
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:34,519
being like I do believe that it's

3696
02:18:32,359 --> 02:18:36,599
accurate to construe being as a

3697
02:18:34,519 --> 02:18:38,840
Battleground between good and evil I

3698
02:18:36,599 --> 02:18:41,719
believe that I believe that is the most

3699
02:18:38,840 --> 02:18:42,960
accurate way of representing being it's

3700
02:18:41,719 --> 02:18:45,000
not the most accurate way of

3701
02:18:42,960 --> 02:18:48,479
representing the objective world that's

3702
02:18:45,000 --> 02:18:51,479
not the same thing being is that set of

3703
02:18:48,479 --> 02:18:53,880
experiences which we inhabit and that's

3704
02:18:51,479 --> 02:18:55,960
only partly objective and it's not

3705
02:18:53,880 --> 02:18:57,800
obviously reducible to the material not

3706
02:18:55,960 --> 02:18:59,479
in any straightforward way because we

3707
02:18:57,800 --> 02:19:03,120
don't understand the material substrate

3708
02:18:59,479 --> 02:19:04,840
of being at all you know it's it's and

3709
02:19:03,120 --> 02:19:06,200
when we do attempt to understand it say

3710
02:19:04,840 --> 02:19:09,559
at the quantum level we run into

3711
02:19:06,200 --> 02:19:13,280
Mysteries that that baffle the most the

3712
02:19:09,559 --> 02:19:14,960
most intelligent of us and aware so I'm

3713
02:19:13,280 --> 02:19:17,559
going to have to leave the question

3714
02:19:14,960 --> 02:19:20,160
hanging but partly because partly

3715
02:19:17,559 --> 02:19:22,559
because I don't know what I think but

3716
02:19:20,160 --> 02:19:22,559
partly

3717
02:19:22,960 --> 02:19:28,240
because there has to be a line between

3718
02:19:25,479 --> 02:19:31,439
what I believe and what what I can

3719
02:19:28,240 --> 02:19:33,280
communicate you know what you believe is

3720
02:19:31,439 --> 02:19:35,679
Beyond Your Capacity to articulate if

3721
02:19:33,280 --> 02:19:38,040
you the most at the deepest levels of

3722
02:19:35,679 --> 02:19:40,359
belief and I can only share with you

3723
02:19:38,040 --> 02:19:41,760
what I have actually come to understand

3724
02:19:40,359 --> 02:19:43,240
and there's things that I don't

3725
02:19:41,760 --> 02:19:46,760
understand and that's definitely one of

3726
02:19:43,240 --> 02:19:49,560
them I don't know how to draw a line

3727
02:19:46,760 --> 02:19:51,359
between the symbolic significance of the

3728
02:19:49,560 --> 02:19:52,840
biblical events say the symbolic and

3729
02:19:51,359 --> 02:19:54,880
psychological significance of the

3730
02:19:52,840 --> 02:19:57,200
biblical events and the metaphysics

3731
02:19:54,880 --> 02:19:59,080
that's underneath them and I think you

3732
02:19:57,200 --> 02:20:01,600
see the same thing in Yung because when

3733
02:19:59,080 --> 02:20:03,160
Yung writes technically and formally he

3734
02:20:01,600 --> 02:20:05,359
never talks about God he always talks

3735
02:20:03,160 --> 02:20:07,479
about the image of God which is not the

3736
02:20:05,359 --> 02:20:09,720
same thing the image of God would be

3737
02:20:07,479 --> 02:20:11,800
your subjective experience of God it

3738
02:20:09,720 --> 02:20:13,280
says nothing about the objective reality

3739
02:20:11,800 --> 02:20:14,560
of God because your subjective

3740
02:20:13,280 --> 02:20:16,600
experience can't say much about

3741
02:20:14,560 --> 02:20:19,040
objective reality but even in Yung you

3742
02:20:16,600 --> 02:20:21,280
get this mix you know sometimes it's

3743
02:20:19,040 --> 02:20:23,200
psychological but then he he makes a

3744
02:20:21,280 --> 02:20:26,040
metaphysical move and I think that

3745
02:20:23,200 --> 02:20:27,920
reflected also his the limits of his

3746
02:20:26,040 --> 02:20:29,680
knowledge because Yong had profound

3747
02:20:27,920 --> 02:20:35,319
revelatory experiences he was a very

3748
02:20:29,680 --> 02:20:38,160
strange person you know and I I

3749
02:20:35,319 --> 02:20:41,280
think so I think what's best for me is

3750
02:20:38,160 --> 02:20:44,080
to stay on the ground that I'm competent

3751
02:20:41,280 --> 02:20:47,000
on and to say what I can say about the

3752
02:20:44,080 --> 02:20:48,840
psychology and to reach beyond that

3753
02:20:47,000 --> 02:20:50,120
brief briefly when it's necessary but

3754
02:20:48,840 --> 02:20:52,479
other than that to leave it to hell

3755
02:20:50,120 --> 02:20:57,120
alone till I understand it better

3756
02:20:52,479 --> 02:20:57,120
assuming that I ever do so

3757
02:21:04,000 --> 02:21:08,640
than so uh because of these lectures

3758
02:21:06,680 --> 02:21:10,399
I've been reading the Bible and well I'm

3759
02:21:08,640 --> 02:21:13,120
obviously not finished but I'm fairly

3760
02:21:10,399 --> 02:21:14,760
familiar with uh with how it goes and uh

3761
02:21:13,120 --> 02:21:16,800
I've been thinking about two parts of it

3762
02:21:14,760 --> 02:21:19,880
in specific which is the story of Isaac

3763
02:21:16,800 --> 02:21:22,040
and the the crucifixion of Christ and

3764
02:21:19,880 --> 02:21:24,960
particularly one of the things that that

3765
02:21:22,040 --> 02:21:27,160
uh Christ says on the cross which is uh

3766
02:21:24,960 --> 02:21:28,359
my God my God why have you forsaken me

3767
02:21:27,160 --> 02:21:29,640
and I've been trying to understand that

3768
02:21:28,359 --> 02:21:32,240
because that's one hell of a thing for

3769
02:21:29,640 --> 02:21:34,680
the Son of God to say and you think that

3770
02:21:32,240 --> 02:21:36,920
would have been edited out yeah no

3771
02:21:34,680 --> 02:21:39,160
seriously it's like why isn't that gone

3772
02:21:36,920 --> 02:21:41,439
you know it it it it's it's very

3773
02:21:39,160 --> 02:21:43,760
inconvenient yeah and

3774
02:21:41,439 --> 02:21:45,520
in well we hav you haven't touched on

3775
02:21:43,760 --> 02:21:48,359
the story of Isaac yet but there's this

3776
02:21:45,520 --> 02:21:49,840
thing the called typ ology which I'm

3777
02:21:48,359 --> 02:21:51,319
sure you're aware of but basically the

3778
02:21:49,840 --> 02:21:52,800
idea that what's going on in the Old

3779
02:21:51,319 --> 02:21:55,520
Testament is sort of the laying out of

3780
02:21:52,800 --> 02:21:56,840
types for Christ and that Isaac is

3781
02:21:55,520 --> 02:21:58,520
essentially a type of Christ because

3782
02:21:56,840 --> 02:22:00,439
they have all these

3783
02:21:58,520 --> 02:22:02,680
similarities and so I've been thinking

3784
02:22:00,439 --> 02:22:06,080
about it in that context and thinking

3785
02:22:02,680 --> 02:22:07,359
about the parallels between them between

3786
02:22:06,080 --> 02:22:09,040
Isaac and Christ and one of the things

3787
02:22:07,359 --> 02:22:11,319
that also struck me was mostly the

3788
02:22:09,040 --> 02:22:12,920
differences between Isaac and Christ and

3789
02:22:11,319 --> 02:22:14,640
the main difference it seems to me is

3790
02:22:12,920 --> 02:22:17,560
sort of a difference in direction of

3791
02:22:14,640 --> 02:22:20,240
sacrifice so the sacrifice is of Abraham

3792
02:22:17,560 --> 02:22:22,600
is Abraham sacrificing his son to God

3793
02:22:20,240 --> 02:22:26,000
and then the S the sacrifice of Jesus Is

3794
02:22:22,600 --> 02:22:28,240
God sacrificing his son to Mankind and

3795
02:22:26,000 --> 02:22:31,640
I've been trying to understand basically

3796
02:22:28,240 --> 02:22:34,120
how that works and in relation to the uh

3797
02:22:31,640 --> 02:22:36,439
you and Western Civilization for 2,000

3798
02:22:34,120 --> 02:22:38,520
years yeah well there is these

3799
02:22:36,439 --> 02:22:41,479
transformations of sacrifice right that

3800
02:22:38,520 --> 02:22:44,840
can so the next thing that happens in in

3801
02:22:41,479 --> 02:22:46,680
these stories is that the circumcision

3802
02:22:44,840 --> 02:22:49,040
circumcision starts to come in as a

3803
02:22:46,680 --> 02:22:51,479
sacrifice and it seems to be something

3804
02:22:49,040 --> 02:22:53,680
like the beginnings of replacement for

3805
02:22:51,479 --> 02:22:56,080
sacrifice of animals it's you know

3806
02:22:53,680 --> 02:22:58,120
there's this this psychologization of

3807
02:22:56,080 --> 02:22:59,439
sacrifice so first it's pure external

3808
02:22:58,120 --> 02:23:01,760
enacted out and then it becomes

3809
02:22:59,439 --> 02:23:03,280
something that's more conceptual like it

3810
02:23:01,760 --> 02:23:04,800
becomes embodied in the form of the

3811
02:23:03,280 --> 02:23:06,560
circumcision and then it becomes more

3812
02:23:04,800 --> 02:23:09,319
conceptual and that conceptual

3813
02:23:06,560 --> 02:23:12,080
transformation keeps occurring and and

3814
02:23:09,319 --> 02:23:14,479
it seems to well it culminates to some

3815
02:23:12,080 --> 02:23:17,279
degree in this idea of the sacrifice of

3816
02:23:14,479 --> 02:23:19,200
Christ who's who's God sacrificing his

3817
02:23:17,279 --> 02:23:21,439
son to mankind but the sacrifice is much

3818
02:23:19,200 --> 02:23:25,000
more complex than that right it's also

3819
02:23:21,439 --> 02:23:27,640
Christ sacrificing himself to God and

3820
02:23:25,000 --> 02:23:28,960
and I think the the the issue there is

3821
02:23:27,640 --> 02:23:31,560
something

3822
02:23:28,960 --> 02:23:33,720
like well let's say You're supposed to

3823
02:23:31,560 --> 02:23:35,640
offer up the best that you have to God

3824
02:23:33,720 --> 02:23:37,840
that's the sacrifice that's what happens

3825
02:23:35,640 --> 02:23:40,040
with the high quality animals that that

3826
02:23:37,840 --> 02:23:42,399
able sacrifices okay but there's

3827
02:23:40,040 --> 02:23:45,359
something better than the best that you

3828
02:23:42,399 --> 02:23:48,479
own well what's that well part of it

3829
02:23:45,359 --> 02:23:50,520
might be well the relationships you have

3830
02:23:48,479 --> 02:23:53,040
with people are you willing to sacrifice

3831
02:23:50,520 --> 02:23:54,880
them to pursue the highest good well

3832
02:23:53,040 --> 02:23:59,359
then are you willing to sacrifice

3833
02:23:54,880 --> 02:24:02,000
yourself or your son like your son might

3834
02:23:59,359 --> 02:24:05,200
be that's a tough one I can understand

3835
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:06,800
the idea of sacrificing yourself better

3836
02:24:05,200 --> 02:24:08,279
I'm still wrestling with this story of

3837
02:24:06,800 --> 02:24:09,600
Isaiah obviously because that's such a

3838
02:24:08,279 --> 02:24:11,040
complicated story and I do think it's

3839
02:24:09,600 --> 02:24:12,800
reasonable to think about it as a form

3840
02:24:11,040 --> 02:24:14,359
of foreshadowing at least the way the

3841
02:24:12,800 --> 02:24:15,520
Bible is set up of course people who

3842
02:24:14,359 --> 02:24:17,760
aren't Christian wouldn't agree with

3843
02:24:15,520 --> 02:24:19,880
that but that that's fine

3844
02:24:17,760 --> 02:24:22,160
um the idea that you would offer

3845
02:24:19,880 --> 02:24:24,040
yourself as a sacrifice to God that that

3846
02:24:22,160 --> 02:24:26,439
seems to me to follow quite logically

3847
02:24:24,040 --> 02:24:28,319
because well obviously you have nothing

3848
02:24:26,439 --> 02:24:30,720
greater to give than the best of

3849
02:24:28,319 --> 02:24:33,000
yourself right so you sacrifice yourself

3850
02:24:30,720 --> 02:24:34,880
to the highest good and that's part of

3851
02:24:33,000 --> 02:24:37,200
the man that's part of the way in which

3852
02:24:34,880 --> 02:24:39,920
humanity is redeemed that makes sense to

3853
02:24:37,200 --> 02:24:41,120
me that just seems like for me that's

3854
02:24:39,920 --> 02:24:44,160
that's a pretty straightforward

3855
02:24:41,120 --> 02:24:46,520
psychological truth the sun issue that's

3856
02:24:44,160 --> 02:24:48,279
that's a lot tougher thing to wrestle

3857
02:24:46,520 --> 02:24:51,279
with because one of the things I was

3858
02:24:48,279 --> 02:24:53,840
thinking with the uh with what Jesus

3859
02:24:51,279 --> 02:24:56,040
says on the cross is that one of the

3860
02:24:53,840 --> 02:24:58,240
interpretations of that uh is basically

3861
02:24:56,040 --> 02:25:00,880
that Jesus in that moment is human

3862
02:24:58,240 --> 02:25:04,240
basically he not this not not Divine

3863
02:25:00,880 --> 02:25:07,000
it's just Jesus the human right but that

3864
02:25:04,240 --> 02:25:08,680
always kind of felt a little bit like

3865
02:25:07,000 --> 02:25:10,080
avoiding the question to me because you

3866
02:25:08,680 --> 02:25:12,080
can't just posit something like the

3867
02:25:10,080 --> 02:25:14,080
Trinity and then say Oh but in this

3868
02:25:12,080 --> 02:25:17,520
moment that doesn't go right that

3869
02:25:14,080 --> 02:25:20,399
doesn't count so but if if we think

3870
02:25:17,520 --> 02:25:22,439
about it in that way of like the

3871
02:25:20,399 --> 02:25:25,080
difference in the direction of sacrifice

3872
02:25:22,439 --> 02:25:26,920
and it seems to me that in the sacrifice

3873
02:25:25,080 --> 02:25:30,160
whoever is making the sacrifice sort of

3874
02:25:26,920 --> 02:25:31,600
aims toward something so Abraham is sort

3875
02:25:30,160 --> 02:25:33,600
of reaching for the Divine when he

3876
02:25:31,600 --> 02:25:37,800
sacrifices when he's going to sacrifice

3877
02:25:33,600 --> 02:25:40,279
his son and so that would mean maybe God

3878
02:25:37,800 --> 02:25:41,479
is reaching toward the human and so that

3879
02:25:40,279 --> 02:25:43,439
would make some sense of that

3880
02:25:41,479 --> 02:25:45,640
interpretation that Christ is only human

3881
02:25:43,439 --> 02:25:47,600
in that moment right that that it's the

3882
02:25:45,640 --> 02:25:50,840
sacrific is accomplished and the

3883
02:25:47,600 --> 02:25:52,640
reaching down is accomplished but I'm

3884
02:25:50,840 --> 02:25:56,600
still up to the question what do I make

3885
02:25:52,640 --> 02:25:58,479
of that because that's one inter well I

3886
02:25:56,600 --> 02:25:59,800
mean it's useful to have a problem like

3887
02:25:58,479 --> 02:26:02,120
that because it gives you something to

3888
02:25:59,800 --> 02:26:04,040
think about right and something to study

3889
02:26:02,120 --> 02:26:06,520
further and it's it's it's a it's a

3890
02:26:04,040 --> 02:26:08,880
major it's a major problem I mean the

3891
02:26:06,520 --> 02:26:10,279
whole issue of well we could say well

3892
02:26:08,880 --> 02:26:12,120
what's the relationship between the

3893
02:26:10,279 --> 02:26:14,000
Divine and the human which is obviously

3894
02:26:12,120 --> 02:26:16,160
brought to the Forefront in the idea of

3895
02:26:14,000 --> 02:26:18,279
Christ right but it's a personal issue

3896
02:26:16,160 --> 02:26:20,520
because part of the issue is what's the

3897
02:26:18,279 --> 02:26:23,800
relationship between you as a finite

3898
02:26:20,520 --> 02:26:25,479
entity and the Transcendent Infinity

3899
02:26:23,800 --> 02:26:28,160
that surrounds you well there's some

3900
02:26:25,479 --> 02:26:30,200
relationship because here you are and

3901
02:26:28,160 --> 02:26:32,960
the Transcendent Infinity around you

3902
02:26:30,200 --> 02:26:35,439
exists so there's a relationship the

3903
02:26:32,960 --> 02:26:37,960
question is what is the relationship and

3904
02:26:35,439 --> 02:26:42,560
and we don't know that and and and it's

3905
02:26:37,960 --> 02:26:45,319
dramatized in that story and so I mean

3906
02:26:42,560 --> 02:26:47,840
partly the the the reason that there's

3907
02:26:45,319 --> 02:26:49,279
so much conflict and confusion in that

3908
02:26:47,840 --> 02:26:50,880
story is because it's trying to bring

3909
02:26:49,279 --> 02:26:53,120
opposing things together right how can

3910
02:26:50,880 --> 02:26:55,600
something be God and man at the same

3911
02:26:53,120 --> 02:26:57,920
time it's just like the genie which is

3912
02:26:55,600 --> 02:27:01,479
the root word of Genius by the way the

3913
02:26:57,920 --> 02:27:03,840
genie is this incredibly powerful force

3914
02:27:01,479 --> 02:27:05,560
that can grant wishes right but it's

3915
02:27:03,840 --> 02:27:08,279
constrained in this tiny little space

3916
02:27:05,560 --> 02:27:10,880
there's an intimation there that for

3917
02:27:08,279 --> 02:27:12,680
something to be real it has to straddle

3918
02:27:10,880 --> 02:27:15,000
The Divide between the finite and the

3919
02:27:12,680 --> 02:27:17,080
infinite and that's what human beings do

3920
02:27:15,000 --> 02:27:18,760
I think to some degree and that's

3921
02:27:17,080 --> 02:27:20,520
dramatized in that story but it doesn't

3922
02:27:18,760 --> 02:27:23,439
mean that we understand it I mean you

3923
02:27:20,520 --> 02:27:24,760
know that sometimes you're going to feel

3924
02:27:23,439 --> 02:27:27,880
that way when you're called upon to make

3925
02:27:24,760 --> 02:27:29,600
a sacrifice you're going to feel that

3926
02:27:27,880 --> 02:27:31,080
you've been betrayed by everything and I

3927
02:27:29,600 --> 02:27:33,160
mean the story is set up that way right

3928
02:27:31,080 --> 02:27:35,160
Christ is betrayed by tyranny he's

3929
02:27:33,160 --> 02:27:38,319
betrayed by his best friends he's

3930
02:27:35,160 --> 02:27:40,000
betrayed by his mortality like that's

3931
02:27:38,319 --> 02:27:42,319
it's an archetypal story because and

3932
02:27:40,000 --> 02:27:45,439
he's innocent so the story can't be any

3933
02:27:42,319 --> 02:27:47,399
worse that's why it's archetypal and I

3934
02:27:45,439 --> 02:27:49,880
mean the story says to to some degree

3935
02:27:47,399 --> 02:27:52,240
that under such conditions even God

3936
02:27:49,880 --> 02:27:55,240
himself would have doubts it's something

3937
02:27:52,240 --> 02:27:57,880
like that and that's a real that's a

3938
02:27:55,240 --> 02:28:00,600
powerful idea it's it's a very powerful

3939
02:27:57,880 --> 02:28:02,770
idea so that's the best I can make out

3940
02:28:00,600 --> 02:28:08,520
of that for

3941
02:28:02,770 --> 02:28:14,279
[Applause]

3942
02:28:08,520 --> 02:28:18,640
now we have to stop so we'll so convene

3943
02:28:14,279 --> 02:28:18,640
again in a week thank you very much

3944
02:28:18,840 --> 02:28:21,940
[Applause]
