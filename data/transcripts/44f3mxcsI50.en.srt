1
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:19,830
So I'm going to read you something. I get some I had a lot of mail

2
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:24,809
And I don't know where I got this I've been a lot of different places in the last week

3
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:30,840
And this showed up at one of them, and I'm going to read it to you. I have no idea what to make of it

4
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:36,870
It's written in a female hand

5
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:41,129
So that's about all I can tell but there's no address or name on it

6
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:44,050
This isn't a question

7
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:48,570
but a comment, or more accurately perhaps a message I

8
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:52,109
Spent this past weekend in an ayahuasca ceremony

9
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:56,759
Which for those of you who don't know is a South American?

10
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:01,709
Visionary plant medicine some of you may roll your eyes at this

11
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:07,798
But ayahuasca brings you into direct contact with the archetypal realm of being

12
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,799
users of this medicine

13
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:15,419
Initiates I should say refer to ayahuasca as she

14
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:23,250
Because the spirit of the plant is decidedly feminine an encounter with ayahuasca is an encounter with the great mother of creation

15
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:28,920
The Goddess the void from which all things come the feminine counterpart of logos

16
00:01:29,979 --> 00:01:31,979
Dr.. Peterson

17
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:35,430
You appeared in one of my ayahuasca visions

18
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:49,240
might account for why I've being ripped rather fatigued lately

19
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:55,360
Dr.. Peterson you appeared in one of my ayahuasca visions, and I asked

20
00:01:55,909 --> 00:02:02,648
Asked her who is Jordan Peterson. What is he doing? Which is something? I'd really like to know as well and

21
00:02:03,409 --> 00:02:05,889
She responded with Crystalline clarity

22
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:08,360
quote

23
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:15,489
Here he is here to invoke and initiate the divine masculine principle on Earth at this time

24
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:27,100
So I'm up here to thank you

25
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:29,649
Deeply and profoundly on behalf of the great mother

26
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:37,899
herself to Goddess the Divine feminine principle who has been eagerly awaiting the awakening of the masculine principle into

27
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,780
divinity and service

28
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:43,809
So you know get a letter like that every day?

29
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,549
Actually, I get a letter to like that every day

30
00:02:52,640 --> 00:03:00,009
so you know what went through my head when I read this and this is of course and completely crazy parallel but

31
00:03:00,859 --> 00:03:07,269
We know one of the things I learned to do as a psychotherapist was just to tell people who were talking to me

32
00:03:07,269 --> 00:03:09,200
What came into my head?

33
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,060
It isn't what I'm thinking exactly because that's not exactly the same thing you know

34
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:17,289
What comes into your head is more like a dream it comes unbidden?

35
00:03:17,359 --> 00:03:22,779
It's like your imagination if you're thinking there seems to be like a voluntary element of that, right?

36
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:28,690
I mean some who God only knows how we think but it seems partly voluntary at least and

37
00:03:30,829 --> 00:03:36,459
Jung thought about carl jung thought about it like a dialogue between the conscious mind and the unconscious mind. There is a constant

38
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,850
Continual dialogue, but when things just pop into your mind

39
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:45,399
It's not much different than walking into a room having something there which is an observation

40
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:52,089
I also derived from jung by the way because he pointed out quite rightly that people don't really think that

41
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:56,739
Thoughts appear to them now you can think because you can take the thoughts that appear to you

42
00:03:56,739 --> 00:03:59,259
and then you can subject them to criticism and

43
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:04,509
Elaboration and so on instead of just assuming that they're true right off the bat, but people often don't do that

44
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:07,360
They just something just pops into their head and then they assume that it's true

45
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:15,250
anyways one of the things that I tend to do in psychotherapy is just to tell people what pops into my head because

46
00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:19,448
Well, why?

47
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:26,109
Because then the person that is talking to me gets one person's

48
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:33,369
Untrammeled opinion not even that reaction not opinion. It's not really an opinion. I don't think an opinion

49
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:36,669
Maybe is what I think later, and there's this personal flavor to it

50
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,250
What popped into my head?

51
00:04:40,100 --> 00:04:42,369
Was the story about socrates you know?

52
00:04:43,729 --> 00:04:49,779
He had this when he was being put on trial by the Athenians for corrupting the nation's youth

53
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:52,270
Something I've been accused of by the way

54
00:04:53,419 --> 00:04:56,799
Although it's not self-evident to me that it's me doing the corrupting

55
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:06,429
He said that somebody had asked him once had asked the delphic oracle once and the Delphic oracle was this

56
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:11,499
retreat that you could go to if you were an ancient Greek citizen and you'd

57
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:17,619
Be there, and you'd have a dream and then you'd go ask the delphic oracle to interpret it and nobody really knows

58
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:19,620
What was up with the delphic oracle?

59
00:05:19,849 --> 00:05:24,249
Today how that worked exactly, but she would interpret your dream in any case

60
00:05:24,979 --> 00:05:26,330
and

61
00:05:26,330 --> 00:05:29,889
somebody once asked her who the wisest man in Greece was and

62
00:05:30,229 --> 00:05:33,848
The Delphic Oracle said it was socrates because he knew he didn't know anything

63
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:39,609
That's essentially the story not popped into my mind. It's a crazy comparison, but

64
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,299
You know I have a crazy mind, so I guess that's how it works out

65
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:45,979
so

66
00:05:45,979 --> 00:05:48,009
Now one of the things I'm going to do today

67
00:05:48,889 --> 00:05:50,750
Which I haven't done before

68
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:54,489
Because I'm going to read you a little bit of I told you I finished my book last week

69
00:05:54,830 --> 00:06:00,820
And I haven't read it read it to anyone. I have given it to a couple of friends to review

70
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,820
one person in particular

71
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:06,760
screenwriter named Greg Hurwitz has been unbelievably

72
00:06:07,389 --> 00:06:11,649
Helpful. He's so fast and so sharp at this sort of thing and I can send him like a

73
00:06:12,889 --> 00:06:15,218
Twenty Page Dense Twenty page

74
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:19,960
Manuscript and he'll rip it to shreds and send it back to me in like 90 minutes

75
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,919
It's just unbelievable he's so good at that. He's been very helpful, but I haven't

76
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:26,559
No one else has seen it apart from my editor

77
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,609
and I haven't read it to anyone so but some of it seemed particularly appropriate for

78
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,810
tonight's lecture

79
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:39,639
So I thought I would start the lecture tonight by reading a little bitter that and it's it's from a chapter

80
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:43,449
It's on the issue of sacrifice as such this is Abraham and Isaac

81
00:06:43,939 --> 00:06:47,979
This is a very strange little testament story right. This is one of the stories

82
00:06:48,469 --> 00:06:54,219
That's contained in the old testament that makes modern people think that maybe we should just not have that punch to do with the old

83
00:06:54,289 --> 00:06:56,589
testament per say it at all and

84
00:06:56,689 --> 00:07:02,528
especially with regards and maybe you shouldn't have anything to do with the god of the old testament either because I mean as far as

85
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,750
Abraham is concerned

86
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:09,519
God tells him to sacrifice his own son now it turns out that God was just kidding

87
00:07:10,219 --> 00:07:15,278
So to speak you know I'm obviously being Flippant but you know it does raise the question

88
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:19,749
What do you make of a divine being who would who would?

89
00:07:20,539 --> 00:07:22,778
require such thing such a thing or

90
00:07:23,419 --> 00:07:28,778
Conversely, what do you make of Abraham? Who would have such delusions either way? It's a little hard on the

91
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:37,300
What would you call modern believability and Moral integrity of the old testament, but these are very very strange stories?

92
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:41,560
and they're not what they seem to be or they are but and they're more so

93
00:07:42,710 --> 00:07:48,489
We're going to talk a lot about sacrifice tonight, and here's some of the things that I've been thinking about sacrifice

94
00:07:48,529 --> 00:07:51,069
So this is from this book. It's called

95
00:07:52,069 --> 00:07:56,588
Twelve Rules for life an antidote for Chaos and it's coming out in January

96
00:07:57,020 --> 00:08:04,569
Which I think I mentioned and this is from Rule 7 which is do. What is meaningful? Not what is expedient?

97
00:08:06,979 --> 00:08:08,839
and so here's

98
00:08:08,839 --> 00:08:10,759
here's some of

99
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:15,338
The writing I've been doing over the last three years on meat on the motif of sacrifice

100
00:08:15,339 --> 00:08:19,269
I'll start with just a brief intro before I read this

101
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,010
It took me a long time to understand

102
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:28,080
What was meant in the old testament by Sacrifice and which is strange because once I figured it out

103
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:32,220
It seemed bloody obvious. It seemed like oh, yo, obviously that's what it means, but

104
00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:39,149
Lots of times if you figure something out correctly it seems self-evident as soon as you've figured it out correctly well

105
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:42,780
We'll see how that goes, but you know it seemed to work for me anyways, I

106
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:53,220
Knew that of course at least implicitly I knew of the modern usage of the idea of sacrifice everyone

107
00:08:53,890 --> 00:09:01,289
understands that motif is that if you want to make things better in the future, then you suck make sacrifices in the present and

108
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:04,210
Maybe you even do that

109
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:10,829
Multi-generationally in fact you most definitely do if you're a good parent, I mean you and that's just I would say that's a really

110
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,179
particularly typical of of Immigrants right because immigrants

111
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,500
often come from

112
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:22,859
Terrible places and have to undergo terrible things to come to a new community where they get a rough?

113
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:25,979
reception and have a hard time getting their life going and

114
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:30,030
A big part of the reason that they do it is to make their lives of their children

115
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:33,240
better and luckily when they come to Canada

116
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:39,389
Usually given where they came from that actually works because where they came from is worse and here is better even though

117
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:43,710
No, you know immigrants often have to struggle to to get on their feet again

118
00:09:43,710 --> 00:09:49,710
Have to learn a new language and become acculturated and face the fact that they're not part of the mainstream culture and well

119
00:09:49,710 --> 00:09:54,719
You know many of you know the whole story, so the idea that you make sacrifices

120
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:58,020
For the future and you make sacrifices for your children

121
00:09:58,020 --> 00:10:05,819
And that's everyone understands without and it's part of being responsible and mature and shouldering the burden of being

122
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:08,879
Properly and you do that for yourself, too

123
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:15,539
if you're disciplined in fact that's almost what discipline means it discipline means that you're capable of making sacrifices because

124
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,080
You're not disciplined if you just do something you want more rather than something that you're doing that's not discipline

125
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:28,169
That's maybe that works and great if your life is working out that way great man, but that isn't that isn't discipline

126
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:30,750
this is plan is when you want to do something right now and

127
00:10:31,390 --> 00:10:35,249
Instead you think no, I'm going to force all my gratification

128
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:40,979
Maybe forever but certainly for a very long period of time medium to long period of time and you

129
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:47,040
concentrate on something that you think will bear fruit in the medium to long run and so you look into the future and

130
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:49,270
You decide that?

131
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:53,369
By making today a little less impulsively pleasurable shall

132
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:58,919
We say you'll make tomorrow a little bit more secure and productive and then you actually do it, too

133
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,490
And that's difficult you know and we discussed last week

134
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,720
Adam and Eve's discovery of the future and

135
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:12,929
and the revelation of the possibility of the future including the possibility of

136
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:20,400
Tragedy and suffering in the future and and it's our knowledge of the possibility of tragedy and suffering in the future that

137
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:23,070
motivates us to

138
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:26,399
Sacrifice in the present so that we can reduce the unnecessary

139
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:31,410
Anxiety and uncertainty and pain that awaits us now. That's a negative way of putting it

140
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:34,499
We're also doing it so that you know we can have some joy

141
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:38,669
and we can make life better in all of that and and that's not trivial, but the

142
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:39,990
fundamental issue

143
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:46,919
Especially once you have small children this fundamental issue is to save the suffering the hell off, right?

144
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,090
That's what you want to do

145
00:11:48,090 --> 00:11:54,840
That's your primary Moral obligation if you're a person who has any if your eyes are open at all. That's your primary

146
00:11:55,030 --> 00:12:01,049
obligation and so you make the sacrifices that are necessary and you set up the future and

147
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,530
Well the the motif of sacrifice

148
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:07,260
Is there in the old testament?

149
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:14,729
But it's more it's so concrete that it's difficult to draw a parallel between the two at least for me. They didn't align

150
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:18,059
Self-eVidently, and I don't remember in my rather limited

151
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:25,139
religious education as a child in the united church because I went to the united church till I was about 13 I

152
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:33,630
don't ever remember anybody pointing out that like the sacrifices that cain and Abel were making or the sacrifice that

153
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:41,130
Abraham was supposed to make or sacrifices that people were making to God were the car were the

154
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,980
precursors, let's say the dramatic

155
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:50,610
precursors to the psychological idea of Accra feist that we all hold as civilized

156
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:57,209
People in the Modern world, so although it seems obvious as I said once you lay it out it

157
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:59,519
I don't remember that ever being explained to me

158
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:04,980
But and then well and then let me read this so now that I've sort of introduced it. Here's what happened as

159
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:07,830
humanity developed

160
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:13,709
first were the endless tens or hundreds of thousands of years prior to the emergence of

161
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:19,950
Written history and drama the Twin practices of Delay and Exchange

162
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:24,540
Began to Emerge slowly and painfully so here's a cool psychological study

163
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:27,210
So it's called the Marshmallow test

164
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:34,619
And maybe it's even a reliable study even though it was done by Social psychologists. It's probably replicable

165
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:40,499
Um and it's a nice study, so you take small children and you

166
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:46,350
bring them into a room and you put something that they would like in front of them a marshmallow and

167
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,490
You then you torture them basically you say

168
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:55,710
See that marshmallow and the kid thinks yeah, I see that marshmallow. It's like

169
00:13:56,650 --> 00:13:58,739
you can have that marshmallow right now, or

170
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,999
If you wait, I think the experiment is ten minutes

171
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,640
then you can have two marshmallows and

172
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:08,550
so that puts the child in quite a conundrum because

173
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:16,319
They're being asked to trade an actual concrete tangible Marshmallow for two hypothetical future

174
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:18,040
marshmallows and

175
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:24,839
it's not that easy to conjure up a hypothetical future reality that has the same tangible significance as

176
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:30,959
Something real right in front of you, and so it's amazing thing that people can do that and so

177
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:37,379
Then the experimenter leaves and some children grab the marshmallow and just you know chomp that thing down right now

178
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,529
Other kids they videotape kids

179
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:42,360
while they're waiting

180
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:47,729
And they do all sorts of things they whistle they look at the ceiling they sit on their hands you know they try to distract

181
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:53,610
themselves course they're eyeing that marshmallow like a squirrel lying and not and and trying to

182
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:58,109
Restrain themselves, and you know what I see in that is that

183
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:04,669
The child's Prefrontal Cortex the higher cortical systems are warring with the underlying

184
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:10,879
Motivational systems more primordial motivational systems that govern such things as hunger the hunger system

185
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,909
hypothalamic system says there is something sweet and

186
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:18,739
Fat right sitting there right bloody now grab that thing and stuff it down now

187
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:26,180
And I'm sure many of you have a constant battle with your hypothalamus with regards to sweet and fat things and often lose

188
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:28,140
so you can feel

189
00:15:28,140 --> 00:15:33,830
Some sympathy for the child but and the hypothalamus has these tremendously powerful

190
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:36,830
Tendrils upward into the Brain

191
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:43,339
Into the parts that we would associate more with voluntary control and the voluntary control centers have these little weak

192
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:50,659
Ribbons going down to control the hypothalamus since it's pretty obvious if you know something about neuroanatomy

193
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:57,080
What part is actually in charge when the chips are down and it's not easy for children to learn to regulate those underlying?

194
00:15:57,660 --> 00:16:02,089
Primordial impulses the ones that are wired in the ones that we share with animals

195
00:16:02,220 --> 00:16:05,390
But they do it and and and the cool thing is

196
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:09,679
This is what Walter mischel found. He's the guy who did the study was that?

197
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,089
the Long-term

198
00:16:12,089 --> 00:16:18,349
Outcome for the children who can delay gratification in the Marshmallow test is much more positive than it is for the children that

199
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:20,839
Are impulsive and eat the marshmallow?

200
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:24,050
Instantly its delay of gratification now

201
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:28,760
It's likely that that's associated with trait conscientiousness although that

202
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:35,719
Specifically has that specific connection has not yet been established, but they seem conceptually very very similar

203
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:39,320
So so anyways

204
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:43,190
this emerges and children

205
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:46,520
Probably between the ages of 2 and 4 something like that

206
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:50,330
They should have it in place by four because it's very difficult for them to

207
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:58,879
really interact well with other children without having that delay of gratification in place because you can't delay gratification other kids don't like you because

208
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:03,140
You're you want everything your way, and you want it now and your lot

209
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:08,179
You're liable to temper tantrums, and that sort of thing you haven't got the kind of self-control necessary to make you fun to play with

210
00:17:09,209 --> 00:17:16,488
So you can see that emerging in children, and it's pretty it's pretty interesting and and not only that if it it predicts positive

211
00:17:17,249 --> 00:17:24,738
Long-term Outcomes just like trade conscientiousness does by the way because trade conscientiousness is the second best predictor of long-term success

212
00:17:25,139 --> 00:17:27,199
over the Lifespan in Western Cultures

213
00:17:27,749 --> 00:17:31,129
Its second after intelligence and so in our societies

214
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:37,639
The people who do best across time are the people who have high Iqs and who work hard and I would say that's a pretty

215
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:39,239
decent

216
00:17:39,239 --> 00:17:41,159
What would you call it?

217
00:17:41,159 --> 00:17:45,829
It's a validation in some sense that our cultures are working properly because what you would want

218
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:53,059
I would say if the system is working meritocratic. Ly like it should and if you're trying to extract resources

219
00:17:53,609 --> 00:17:56,389
From those who can contribute at a higher rate?

220
00:17:57,090 --> 00:18:01,489
Than what you would want to have happen is that the hard-working smart people do better?

221
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:05,539
Hopefully if that's the case then everyone does better hopefully

222
00:18:07,529 --> 00:18:08,879
anyways

223
00:18:08,879 --> 00:18:15,259
So you can see this developing in children first where they endless tens or hundreds of thousands of years prior to the emergence of written?

224
00:18:15,259 --> 00:18:22,549
History and drama the Twin practices of Delay and exchange began to Emerge slowly and painfully then they became

225
00:18:22,889 --> 00:18:25,159
represented in metaphorical abstraction as

226
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:28,279
rituals and tales of sacrifice

227
00:18:28,679 --> 00:18:36,258
It's as if there's a powerful figure in the sky who's judging you you better keep him happy or look the hell out

228
00:18:37,289 --> 00:18:43,488
We've been watching ourselves deal with him for a long time. He seems to like it when you give up something you value

229
00:18:44,279 --> 00:18:45,869
so

230
00:18:45,869 --> 00:18:49,369
Practice sharing and sacrificing until you get good at it

231
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:55,459
No, one actually said any of this so long ago although they said

232
00:18:56,369 --> 00:19:00,619
Something very similar, but it was implicit in the practice and then in the stories

233
00:19:01,379 --> 00:19:03,379
action comes first

234
00:19:03,659 --> 00:19:06,169
implicit comes first people watched

235
00:19:06,779 --> 00:19:13,429
The successful succeed and the unsuccessful fail for thousands and thousands of years

236
00:19:13,429 --> 00:19:18,319
And we thought it over and we drew a conclusion the successful among us

237
00:19:18,779 --> 00:19:22,579
Sacrifice the successful among us delay gratification

238
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:33,980
a successful among us bargain with the future and then a great idea begins to Emerge in ever more articulated form

239
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:37,880
That idea is the point of a long and profound story

240
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:47,510
It's the moral of this story, and I'm going to engage in some foreshadowing here

241
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:53,990
What's the difference between the successful and the unsuccessful the successful sacrifice?

242
00:19:55,830 --> 00:20:00,559
And things get better as the successful practice their sacrifices

243
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:04,700
the question becomes increasingly precise and

244
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:07,260
simultaneously

245
00:20:07,260 --> 00:20:09,260
broader

246
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:13,880
What is the greatest possible sacrifice for the greatest possible good?

247
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:21,590
You know if you if you push a question in a direction perhaps there comes a time when you can't formulate it any more

248
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,960
precisely and broadly and

249
00:20:24,210 --> 00:20:26,190
and

250
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:32,390
That that's the point at which the question in some sense and perhaps even the answer the question becomes our Katha Pollitt it becomes archetypal

251
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:34,610
Because it it can't be

252
00:20:34,770 --> 00:20:36,300
bested and

253
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,570
This is like an ultimate question in some sense

254
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:43,669
How are you going to ask a more broad-based question than that, what is given the initial?

255
00:20:44,070 --> 00:20:45,690
Presuppositions that you have to make sacrifices

256
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:49,519
Then the logical end point to that is something like okay if you have to make a sacrifice

257
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:56,990
What's the greatest possible sacrifice and for the greatest possible good that's a good question the answer becomes

258
00:20:57,690 --> 00:20:59,550
increasingly profound

259
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,820
for the God of Western Tradition like

260
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:08,900
So many gods requires sacrifice. We've already examined why but sometimes he goes even further and

261
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:12,860
Requires the sacrifice of what is loved best?

262
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:17,869
This is why and this is another one of Mankind's

263
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,200
fundamental discoveries

264
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:27,830
Sometimes things do not go well that that's self-evident, but here's the rub

265
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:36,529
Sometimes when things are not going well, it's precisely that which is most valued that is the cause

266
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:47,350
Why it's because the world is revealed through the template of your values if the world you are seeing is not the world you want

267
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:48,740
therefore

268
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,740
It's time to examine your values

269
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:54,760
It's time to Rid yourself of your current presuppositions

270
00:21:55,550 --> 00:22:00,159
There's a famous experiment that I've alluded to a couple of times. I believe in this lecture series

271
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:06,430
The invisible Gorilla experiment and in the invisible gorilla experiment. There's two teams of

272
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:13,360
players each with three members one dressed in block and the other dressed in white and each team is

273
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:17,259
passing a basketball back and forth to the team members and milling about

274
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:22,659
you see a video of them doing so they basically fill the video screen and

275
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:27,309
The white team is passing a basketball to the white team members and the black

276
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:30,310
team is passing a basketball to the black team members and

277
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:36,939
Your job as as far as the experimenter is concerned is for you to count the number of times that the black

278
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:40,000
block team yes black team

279
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:42,909
Passes the basketball back and forth so that's what you do

280
00:22:42,910 --> 00:22:46,750
so now you have an ambition and a name and a value and

281
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:52,539
The ambition and the Aim and the value they're all the same thing and that is to perform well at the task now the thing

282
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:55,480
That's so cool about this, and this is really so cool. It's just

283
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,170
unbelievably

284
00:22:57,170 --> 00:23:04,389
It's just unbelievable that this is the case. It's like a complete validation of a certain element of the buddhist worldview

285
00:23:05,870 --> 00:23:10,179
So they passed the ball for a couple of minutes and then the experimenter says to you

286
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:15,969
how many and you say 15 and because you're happy and you're happy with yourself because you've been paying attention and and

287
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:18,700
The experimenter says yeah, that's right or maybe not

288
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:25,480
Maybe you missed one and then the experimenter says did you see the gorilla and half of you say what what?

289
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:30,880
What your real eye like really and he's in the experimenter says yes

290
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:36,699
And then he rewinds it and plays the video and like a minute and a half into the 3-minute video sure enough

291
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:41,320
In walks this guy in a gorilla suit six foot three or so

292
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:47,830
Stands in the middle of the game right in the middle of the game the same size as the players

293
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:50,680
perfectly obviously

294
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:56,409
evident the his chest for like a second and a half and then sort of saunters off and

295
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,200
Half the people who?

296
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:01,330
Watch the video don't see the gorilla

297
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:08,109
And which is absolutely shocking and what that means is that your ambitions blind you to the nature of reality?

298
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:11,650
Now they illuminate some reality

299
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:15,879
But they blind you to most of it, and that's fine because you're not

300
00:24:16,549 --> 00:24:20,799
Does not allow to you in some ways you're a very pinpoint thing like a laser beam

301
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:23,589
And so you just can't be attending to everything all the time

302
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:30,969
But one of the things that you might ask yourself once you know that is that if you're suffering dreadfully then one possibility is that?

303
00:24:31,730 --> 00:24:35,709
You're so fixed on the point you're so fixed on a point

304
00:24:36,740 --> 00:24:41,679
The fact that you're so fixed on the point that you're fixed on might be integrally related

305
00:24:41,929 --> 00:24:45,038
To why things are going so catastrophic Aliy wrong

306
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:50,080
now perhaps not because you know there's a lot of arbitrariness about life and

307
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:56,949
Perhaps you suffer even when you don't deserve to that seems to happen in the book of job for example because job is a good

308
00:24:56,950 --> 00:25:03,069
Guy and God has a bet with Satan which seems like another relatively nasty thing to do to let's say it just torture

309
00:25:03,289 --> 00:25:05,289
And he does quite nicely

310
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,490
to see if he'll

311
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:10,449
Turn against God and it seems like a rather

312
00:25:11,149 --> 00:25:16,299
playground sort of thing for God to engage in but the point is is that even in a

313
00:25:17,029 --> 00:25:19,029
Document like the Old testament, there's Ample

314
00:25:20,299 --> 00:25:26,949
Suggestion that sometimes people just get wiped out and hurt even if they're living good Moral lives

315
00:25:27,409 --> 00:25:30,969
Aiming properly and all that there's an arbitrariness in life you that's not

316
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,389
It erratic low, but it's possible that

317
00:25:35,149 --> 00:25:37,299
It's what you're clinging to

318
00:25:37,970 --> 00:25:40,600
That's hurting you and it's even possible

319
00:25:40,669 --> 00:25:46,089
That's the thing that you're clinging to the hardest that's hurting you the most that could easily be someone you love like lots of times

320
00:25:46,090 --> 00:25:49,630
I see people in therapy, and they're miserable for one reason or another

321
00:25:50,179 --> 00:25:54,069
Sometimes it's because they have a very close relationship with a family member and that

322
00:25:55,010 --> 00:26:00,039
Just isn't working you know the family member for the sake of simplicity

323
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:08,020
Will say is not really oriented towards helping them have a good life the family member is instead oriented towards

324
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:12,939
making them as bloody miserable as you can possibly make anyone and and

325
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:20,859
What would you say exploiting the the bond between family members in order to enable that and then?

326
00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:22,730
sometimes

327
00:26:22,730 --> 00:26:25,630
The sacrifice that's necessary is either

328
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,559
Merely distancing yourself from that person

329
00:26:30,649 --> 00:26:32,649
sometimes substantively and sometimes

330
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,500
seriously distancing yourself from like

331
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:42,219
we don't talk anymore ever and so that's pretty damn rough and it hurts and all of that, but

332
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:44,570
but

333
00:26:44,570 --> 00:26:48,130
it's a good example of the fact that sometimes in order to

334
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:57,010
Extract yourself from the miserable bit of Chaos that you happen to be enmeshed in you have to let go of what you love best

335
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:03,369
If the world you are seeing is not the world you want therefore. It's time to examine your values

336
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:05,480
That's really worth

337
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:09,429
It's really worth thinking about you know because the alternative to is to curse fate

338
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:13,360
Right because if it isn't you and there's nothing you can do to change there

339
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:17,799
Isn't something you're doing that's wrong then it's faith itself. It's the world itself

340
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:22,929
It's other people let's say because they're a huge part of the world or it's the nature of the world itself or or its God

341
00:27:23,090 --> 00:27:24,860
himself in whatever

342
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:31,569
Form you either believe in or don't believe in because it's fundamentally all the same in the sort of situation that I'm describing

343
00:27:32,179 --> 00:27:38,229
So and one of the things that's really interesting and I mentioned this before about the israelites in the old testament is that they?

344
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:44,890
They got this right. It's really something because what happens to the israelites over and over in the old testament is that

345
00:27:45,529 --> 00:27:51,398
they get all puffed up about how wonderful they are and then they make moral errors because they're arrogant and

346
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:55,990
Then God comes along and just cuts them into pieces for like generation after generation

347
00:27:56,210 --> 00:28:03,640
And then they wobble back to their feet and but they always maintain the same attitude. Which is we did something wrong

348
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:07,359
We did something wrong. It's like. It's like it's like an axiom

349
00:28:07,909 --> 00:28:12,219
Rather than observation is that if we're not if things are not laying

350
00:28:12,409 --> 00:28:18,339
Themselves out for us as they should be then we cannot curse. God we have to look to ourselves

351
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,909
Well, you think well why not curse God?

352
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,880
Because maybe it's his fault

353
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:32,199
That's a really good question and one of the things that I've tried to figure out over the last 30 years is well

354
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:36,760
Why not just curse God because there is this arbitrary element to existence and we are?

355
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:41,919
Vulnerable, and there is a plenty of suffering and things are unfair like there's problems, right?

356
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:45,459
There's injustice and unfairness and all of these things and endless suffering

357
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:51,730
So why not just lay at the feet of God and the whether God exists or not in some sense by the way?

358
00:28:52,220 --> 00:28:55,750
With regards to the metaphysics of this particular discussion is not relevant

359
00:28:55,750 --> 00:29:01,659
it's the point remains the same either way and the answer is as far as I can tell that if you

360
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:05,649
Refuse to take on the responsibility yourself

361
00:29:05,649 --> 00:29:12,309
And you attempt it to lay it at the feet of either society or being itself then you

362
00:29:12,679 --> 00:29:17,739
Instantly start to act in a way that makes everything much worse not only for you

363
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:23,589
But for everyone else and maybe even for being itself and so no, it's not helpful

364
00:29:24,409 --> 00:29:28,268
Now if you're if you decide that it's you, you've got the problem

365
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:33,819
Maybe that's not even true like maybe you are someone who's being tortured by the bet between God and Satan

366
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:39,908
And like too bad for you, if that happens to be the case, but it still seems to be the appropriate thing

367
00:29:41,659 --> 00:29:45,819
For a human being who's standing on his or her own?

368
00:29:46,610 --> 00:29:51,669
Two feet in a proper manner to take the responsibility on for themselves

369
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:56,860
Regardless of the counter-Arguments that might be made against it. That's really something

370
00:29:58,519 --> 00:30:03,519
It's time to Rid yourself of your current presuppositions. I also think of that. It's a deadwood issue

371
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:09,309
You know one of the things you see with motifs like the pair of the Phoenix

372
00:30:09,889 --> 00:30:14,439
Remember when harry potter goes off to fight. He's like st.. George. He goes off to fight the

373
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:19,809
The hell is that thing the basilisk that turns you to stone when you look at it's a dragon for all intents and purposes

374
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:25,239
Its guarding a virgin bird. What's her name for it's not Virginia. It's close to that though

375
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:32,679
Ginny Ginny Ginevra, right which is a variant of virgin and very introvert for Jigna well when he gets bitten?

376
00:30:33,429 --> 00:30:35,429
by the Dragon and

377
00:30:35,979 --> 00:30:41,519
Poisoned that's the dragon of Chaos right the thing that turns you to stone when you look at it when he gets

378
00:30:41,859 --> 00:30:44,039
bitten by it then he's going to die and

379
00:30:44,679 --> 00:30:48,478
Yeah, well if you get bitten by the thing that turns you to stone when you look at it

380
00:30:48,479 --> 00:30:51,688
If it bites you man, if you're not dead, you're going to wish you are

381
00:30:51,689 --> 00:30:52,839
it's one of the two and

382
00:30:52,839 --> 00:30:58,229
Then the Phoenix flies in and cries tears into the wound and that heals them and the Phoenix is the thing that

383
00:30:58,569 --> 00:31:00,809
Allows the dead wood to burn off

384
00:31:02,679 --> 00:31:07,108
Occasionally let's say well, it's I think it's once every hundred years with the Phoenix and of course

385
00:31:07,109 --> 00:31:11,578
It's pretty dramatic the whole damn bird has to go up in flames, and then there's nothing left, but an egg

386
00:31:11,579 --> 00:31:14,039
But there's a very serious message there, too

387
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:20,128
Which is that you know you can compare yourself in some sense to a forest fire to a forest

388
00:31:20,129 --> 00:31:26,399
You know in a forest has to burn now and then for the deadwood to clear so that the forest can actually maintain its continued

389
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:31,738
Existence and if you stopped the forest from burning for a prolonged period of time which happened in the United States

390
00:31:32,139 --> 00:31:34,679
when they were trying to manage the forest fires too tightly

391
00:31:34,839 --> 00:31:39,958
Then all that happens is the dead wood accumulates and accumulates and accumulates and accumulates and accumulates

392
00:31:40,959 --> 00:31:45,239
Until the whole damn Forest is dead wood and then lightning hits it and it burns

393
00:31:45,239 --> 00:31:51,779
So hot that it burns the topsoil off, and then there's nothing left nothing grows, and so that's a good moral

394
00:31:51,779 --> 00:31:58,348
Lesson which is don't wait too long to let the damn dead wood burn off. You know maybe a little self-immolation

395
00:31:58,919 --> 00:31:59,289
on A

396
00:31:59,289 --> 00:32:06,299
daily basis might be preferable to burning yourself all the way down to the Bedrock you know once every 20 years or so because maybe

397
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:08,308
There won't be anything left of you when you do that

398
00:32:08,309 --> 00:32:13,439
and you know that happens to people all the time I've seen that happen to people many many times the

399
00:32:13,719 --> 00:32:20,849
Dead wood accumulates the mess around them Gathers the Chaos that they haven't dealt with accumulates, and then one day the spark comes

400
00:32:20,849 --> 00:32:25,799
And they burn so far and so fast that there's not enough left of them to recover

401
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:28,228
And then they're the people who've been eaten by the beast

402
00:32:28,229 --> 00:32:35,279
They're they're people who've been eaten by the dragon and now are inside its belly another very common archetypal motif and well

403
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:38,549
Maybe a hero will come along and rescue them or maybe they'll just stay in there forever

404
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:43,109
And that's a precursor to the idea of hell, and it's not something I would recommend

405
00:32:43,659 --> 00:32:46,049
So a little medicine on a regular basis

406
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:49,170
Is a lot better too than total emulation?

407
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:51,930
On terms other than your own

408
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:55,200
sporadically

409
00:32:55,570 --> 00:32:59,279
It's time to Rid yourself of your current presuppositions. There's another segment

410
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:04,769
See in the soviet union with solzhenitsyn wrote about the soviet union

411
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,500
comments Pathologies it

412
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:15,960
It's sort of peaked in terms of its pathological authoritarianism when it became illegal to complain that your life wasn't going well

413
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:19,200
and you just think about how horrible that is say because

414
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:25,349
Because you know lots of times your life, isn't going well. I mean, and I don't mean this in some casual way

415
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:25,710
I mean

416
00:33:25,710 --> 00:33:32,460
Maybe I don't know maybe have diabeetus in your you know maybe you're gonna lose your your feet or something like it's really not

417
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:39,239
it's nothing trivial that's going on here something is not good or maybe it's economic or maybe you're unemployed or and

418
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:44,670
But you see the idea in the soviet Union was well. We already have all the answers

419
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,400
everything's perfect already

420
00:33:48,190 --> 00:33:51,719
that's what totalitarian is fake well, if everything is perfect and

421
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:54,160
you're

422
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,160
suffering then

423
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:58,350
well, maybe there's something wrong with you because

424
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:03,570
Everything is perfect after all and if you're suffering then what are you to come out? And say well? I'm suffering

425
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:10,679
It's like well, then your evidence that things aren't perfect right you're like a widow or an orphan in an old testament story

426
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:13,469
You know when the kings got to high and mighty then they?

427
00:34:13,630 --> 00:34:17,459
Wouldn't pay enough attention to the widows and the orphans and then the profit would come along and say you

428
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:19,710
know those widows and orphans a

429
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:23,850
Lot more important than you think they are and if you don't pay attention to them properly then

430
00:34:24,580 --> 00:34:28,049
things are going to fall apart around you in a way that you just can't even imagine and

431
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:31,440
So well then you're sort of like your own widow and your own orphan

432
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:36,419
But you don't get say hey look you know things aren't perfect yet, because I'm actually having still quite a rough time here

433
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:39,480
You don't get to admit to your own suffering

434
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:44,219
If you can't admit to your own suffering then you certainly

435
00:34:44,890 --> 00:34:46,750
See the suffering

436
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:53,729
Especially the additional suffering the excess suffering should be treated as evidence that you're not doing something quite right yet?

437
00:34:55,149 --> 00:34:57,869
It should be treated as evidence that you're wrong

438
00:34:58,630 --> 00:35:02,519
There's something important that you're doing that's wrong. I understand

439
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:10,109
How harsh that is and I'm not saying that everyone who's suffering is suffering because they're doing something in some simple way, that's wrong

440
00:35:10,109 --> 00:35:13,078
I was in a elevator once in a hospital

441
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:18,990
It's a very terrifying thing and this person got on who was just in an absolute state of shock you know

442
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:20,990
I mean it was really

443
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:22,990
not good and

444
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:26,819
I don't remember how this happened, but I engaged the person in conversation

445
00:35:26,819 --> 00:35:31,288
and they just said that they had just had been diagnosed with what looked to be terminal cancer and

446
00:35:32,650 --> 00:35:35,549
What was horrifying about it was that what they were doing was?

447
00:35:36,039 --> 00:35:38,309
Going over their life in the elevator

448
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:44,099
trying to figure out what they had done in order to deserve such a fate you know they've immediately taken it on themselves as a

449
00:35:44,099 --> 00:35:46,649
Moral failing and that's not what I'm saying you can't

450
00:35:47,319 --> 00:35:52,739
Come up to someone who has cancer and say well if you weren't such a bloody idiot throughout your whole life you wouldn't have cancer

451
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:57,359
And believe me that happens a lot more than you think and people who have diseases like that get blamed for it

452
00:35:57,420 --> 00:36:02,579
That's not what I'm saying. It's not like that. It's it's it's it's a more generalized attitude

453
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:08,999
That is that if life isn't yet what it should be then you have a response you have a primary responsibility to do something about

454
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,000
It and the place to start looking is

455
00:36:11,859 --> 00:36:17,308
to your own errors and to fix them and that's and that's that's

456
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:21,660
That's a safe bet man, because you're probably doing some things that you

457
00:36:21,759 --> 00:36:25,169
Would wouldn't have to be doing that if you fixed would make things better

458
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:28,859
So it's time to let go and to sacrifice who you are

459
00:36:29,710 --> 00:36:31,710
For who you could become?

460
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:46,590
There's an old story about how to catch a monkey

461
00:36:47,410 --> 00:36:52,920
In case any of you aren't interested in how to catch a monkey now you now you're going to know how to do it

462
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:57,150
First you have to take a large narrow necked Jar

463
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:59,940
Just large enough in diameter at the top

464
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:04,169
For a monkey to put its hand inside then you have to fill it partway with rocks

465
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:10,350
So it's too heavy for the monkey to carry then you scatter some treats near the jar to attract them and you put some inside

466
00:37:10,660 --> 00:37:15,240
inside the narrow neck jar a monkey will come along if you're lucky and

467
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:17,110
Grab the

468
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:21,239
You know goodies, but he'll want the ones inside the jar, too

469
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:24,419
So then put his hand in there and grab what's in there?

470
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:28,409
And if you've set up your monkey trap properly then he won't be able to eat his hand out

471
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,619
Because he's got good goodies

472
00:37:33,550 --> 00:37:38,070
Not without unclenching his hand not without relinquishing what he already has

473
00:37:38,530 --> 00:37:43,290
The monkey Coucher can just walk over and just pick up the monkey because the monkey isn't

474
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:52,469
Into the whole sacrifice thing because he's just a monkey you know and so you can catch him as a consequence of his own

475
00:37:53,830 --> 00:37:59,340
Unregulated hypothalamic desires, you know and to be. What would you say?

476
00:38:00,670 --> 00:38:05,460
Charitable to the monkey if you put out candy or something like that's like how often does a monkey get candy

477
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:10,050
He's probably a little more motivated than you are to not let go but you can get the point

478
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:15,539
The Monkey Catcher can just walk over to the jar and pick up the monkey the animal will not sacrifice

479
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:22,199
The part for the whole that's actually a pretty good phrase. It's the animal that will not sacrifice the part for the whole

480
00:38:24,340 --> 00:38:29,459
Perhaps this story is apocryPhal, but as an eccentric pSychology professor once told me

481
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:34,739
Fiction lies to you in the most truth in the most truthful possible Manner

482
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:41,310
something valuable given up ensures future prosperity something valuable sacrificed

483
00:38:41,950 --> 00:38:43,120
pleases the Lord

484
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:45,269
Those are equivalent statements ones

485
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:47,070
more articulated

486
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:53,430
I would say that's the first statement then the second one is more dramatic and more embedded in a collective religion dream. You might say

487
00:38:54,460 --> 00:38:59,159
What's most valuable and best sacrifice well obviously that depends on the culture and the time?

488
00:39:01,030 --> 00:39:03,959
What is at least emblematic of that a choice cut of meat?

489
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:10,770
Well if you're a herdsmen for example that that's a big deal with I mean generally speaking throughout human history meat has been a very

490
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:13,230
Valuable Commodity as it is by the way among chimpanzees

491
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:21,809
Chimpanzees hunt they like to hunt colobus monkeys, and you know they'll they'll basically start eating the damn monkey alive they weigh about 40 pounds

492
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,869
Despite the fact that the thing is screaming away

493
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:30,900
And that's pretty interesting because one of the things that indicates is that male monkeys that male chimps

494
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:33,359
They're the ones that do the hunting aren't really

495
00:39:34,390 --> 00:39:39,780
inhibited that much when they're in hunter mode by what you might describe as empathy and

496
00:39:40,510 --> 00:39:46,379
there's certain elements of human behavior that are reminiscent of that you see that sort of thing emerged now and then in

497
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,589
Human Battlefields when groups of men

498
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:51,520
seem to

499
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:52,900
Abandon all

500
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:59,970
internal regulation whatsoever to a degree that makes you wonder if internal regulation even exists

501
00:40:03,580 --> 00:40:09,360
So it's kind of meat. Well meats valuable you know and this is a good document by Richard, Wrangham

502
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:13,140
I think while back a book about the human invention of fire

503
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:18,809
And I think I told you a little bit about this wrangham claimed that we invented fire discovered fire mastered it

504
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:20,580
Maybe two or three million years ago

505
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:26,549
That's a long time longer than people had thought and that that's what actually transformed us physiologically from our chimp-like

506
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:28,950
Ancestors into the Sort of Svelte creatures

507
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:33,750
we are now because it's a lot easier to digest cooked meat and meat is a tremendous source of of

508
00:40:34,660 --> 00:40:36,610
nutrition energy

509
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:42,270
Raw materials all of that especially if it's cooked so me, it's a big deal cook meat is a big deal

510
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:45,450
and maybe it's a choice cut of meat the

511
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:51,689
Kind you might offer to a guest if you're not a I always say this wrong said vegan

512
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:57,629
Vegan or vagin. I always think vagin, but that's wrong. That's that's a star vague as a star, right?

513
00:40:57,630 --> 00:41:00,599
They're not like star creatures. They're they're yeah

514
00:41:01,510 --> 00:41:04,979
Anyway, so you know you might offer that especially

515
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:10,400
Especially if a guest came to your abode and you were I heard

516
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:19,069
Man, you might sacrifice a high-end animal and offer your guests a nice choice cut of meat and that would actually matter

517
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:21,070
It would mean something

518
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:28,190
From the best animal in a flock. What's above even that well in terms of the thing you could sacrifice

519
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:37,099
Well your best animal that's good. Well. How about you? How about your child? How about you? Well that would be next on the

520
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:41,719
Hierarchy it's kind of hard to get past that right, and I think it's a it's a toss-up whether

521
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:44,420
the Sacrifice is

522
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:50,689
Greater if it's you or if it's your child. I would say being a parent that it's greater if it's your child

523
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:54,229
because I think most people who have established a

524
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:56,750
I

525
00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:03,019
Hate I hesitate to say proper, but I'm going to anyway. It's a proper relationship with their children. It's if push came to shove

526
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:08,509
They'd take the bullet and let their kid go live

527
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:16,790
The sacrifice of the mother is exemplified profoundly by Michelangelo's great Sculpture the Pa de

528
00:42:18,330 --> 00:42:25,069
Mary is contemplating her son crucified Andrews, so that's his body after he's been crucified. It's her fault it was through her

529
00:42:25,070 --> 00:42:30,979
He entered the great dream of being so what's the meaning of this sculpture? It's a great sculpture. It's just an absolutely unbelievable

530
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:38,299
Sculpture you just can't believe that someone could exist who could make something like and of course it wasn't the only thing

531
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:44,600
Michelangelo made right it was like. That's it. It was something he just tossed off in a couple of months while he was doing other

532
00:42:45,270 --> 00:42:47,270
unbelievable things, but you know

533
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:53,209
It's it's an it's an object of contemplation. Which is why it's in a great cathedral in a great city

534
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:56,600
It's an object of contemplation and the idea is something like

535
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:02,420
Well what what's the role of a mother if she's awake I?

536
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:06,200
Had a client come see me a while back not very long ago

537
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:12,020
Woman in a boat who's about 30 and trying to make decisions about her life

538
00:43:14,790 --> 00:43:17,060
She was pretty career oriented and so I asked her about

539
00:43:17,670 --> 00:43:24,869
Although maybe having a bit of trouble with career. I've seen this many many times, so this is an amalgam. This is a story

540
00:43:24,870 --> 00:43:26,320
That's an amalgam

541
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:28,270
and I talked to her about

542
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:30,780
The other elements of her life. It's like well, you know

543
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:38,160
There's only five things you do in life. So you've got your career down. You know. What do you do outside of your career?

544
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:39,970
That's meaningful and engaging

545
00:43:39,970 --> 00:43:43,949
How are things going with your family could be your family of origin your siblings?

546
00:43:43,950 --> 00:43:48,929
Whatever if you have an intimate relationship and like what's your plan for your own family?

547
00:43:49,510 --> 00:43:54,120
And apart from those five things there's sort of something like get some exercise now

548
00:43:54,120 --> 00:43:57,269
And then don't eat too badly and try to stay away from the drugs

549
00:43:57,270 --> 00:44:01,499
You know that's that that kind of and the crime that kind of lays out

550
00:44:02,110 --> 00:44:08,459
Life, and if you miss any of those five things or if you do any of those other things wrong

551
00:44:08,460 --> 00:44:11,070
Then you're in trouble, and you can get away with missing a couple of them

552
00:44:11,070 --> 00:44:14,429
But not all of them you know and she said something along the lines of well

553
00:44:14,430 --> 00:44:16,210
I'm not sure I should bring a child into this world

554
00:44:16,210 --> 00:44:21,210
I thought oh God christ you got to come up with something better than that such a bloody cliche

555
00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:25,020
Which is what I told her I said you know you must have thought that up when you were 16

556
00:44:25,020 --> 00:44:29,759
It's like really that's here that you can't do any better. This is a very very smart woman

557
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:35,189
It's like really and this can't do any better than that like yes, obviously this is a vale of tears

558
00:44:35,190 --> 00:44:39,870
And you know a well of suffering and all of that. You know if you ask 30 people who are

559
00:44:40,480 --> 00:44:47,969
Wondering about having children. Why they're wondering 20 of them will say that and so that that tells you how original it is

560
00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:50,130
It's not original at all. It's not a thought

561
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:55,140
It's like this little it's like a it's like a it's a mean something that lives in your mind

562
00:44:55,140 --> 00:44:58,379
It's not a thought, and it's certainly not something

563
00:44:58,380 --> 00:45:02,130
It's certainly not something that you should just take it face value in and say oh well

564
00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:07,019
I'm not having a family then it's like no. No you kind of look at that, and you criticize it a little bit

565
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:08,860
It's like well the pop

566
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:13,890
It's the other one. That's the other one. That's very common. There's too many people on the planet already I

567
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:19,260
Really don't like that statement

568
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:24,299
It's like just who are you going to ask to leave just how are you going to get them to leave?

569
00:45:24,520 --> 00:45:31,050
You know it's a serious question and who says there's too many people what the hell is wrong with people anyways

570
00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:33,170
so or

571
00:45:33,170 --> 00:45:34,880
ruining the planet yeah

572
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,880
It's like I think it was the club of rome

573
00:45:37,220 --> 00:45:41,139
Who who prophesied by the way that there would be so many people on the planet by the year?

574
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:46,149
2000 that there would be widespread starvation, and they were completely and utterly wrong about that

575
00:45:46,150 --> 00:45:51,910
And I think it was the club of rome who either compared us to a virus or a cancer on the face of the planet?

576
00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:58,569
It's like oh really that's what you think about people hmm. Aren't you something isn't that something to think about human beings?

577
00:45:59,150 --> 00:46:03,999
Viruses and cancer, what do you do with viruses and cancer invite them in and make them at home?

578
00:46:04,009 --> 00:46:06,459
It's like no you try to eradicate them

579
00:46:06,529 --> 00:46:12,309
You've got a bloody well watch your metaphors folks because it isn't clear that you come up with them or that they run you

580
00:46:12,589 --> 00:46:14,589
So you better watch them?

581
00:46:17,869 --> 00:46:19,700
so anyways Mary

582
00:46:19,700 --> 00:46:24,009
You know and Mary's the great mother right that she's the mother that's what Mary is

583
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:31,480
Whether she existed or not is not the point she exists at least as a hyper reality she exists as the mother well

584
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:37,419
What's the sacrifice of the mother well that's easy if you're a mother and you if you're a mother who's worth her salt

585
00:46:37,789 --> 00:46:44,768
You offer your son to be destroyed by the world. That's what you do. That's what's going to happen, right?

586
00:46:45,079 --> 00:46:52,058
He's going to be born he's going to suffer. He's going to have his trouble in life. He's going to have his illnesses

587
00:46:52,099 --> 00:46:57,068
He's going to face his failures and catastrophes and he's going to die

588
00:46:57,440 --> 00:47:02,529
That's what's going to happen and if you're awake, you know that and then you say well perhaps

589
00:47:02,529 --> 00:47:06,669
He will live in a way that will justify that and then you try to have that happen

590
00:47:06,670 --> 00:47:09,970
And that's what makes you worthy of a statue like that

591
00:47:12,109 --> 00:47:14,109
but still the sacrifice of the mother

592
00:47:17,749 --> 00:47:20,649
Is it right to bring a baby into this terrible world?

593
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:26,289
Well every woman asks yourself that question some say no, and they have the reasons

594
00:47:26,989 --> 00:47:34,419
Mary answers yes, Voluntarily Mary is the archetype of the woman who answers yes to life

595
00:47:35,150 --> 00:47:40,089
Voluntarily that's what that image means and not because she's blind

596
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:45,278
She knows what's going to happen and so she's the archetypal

597
00:47:45,589 --> 00:47:48,428
Representation of the woman who says yes to life knowing full

598
00:47:48,429 --> 00:47:50,589
Well, what what life is not Naive?

599
00:47:50,589 --> 00:47:56,708
not someone who got pregnant in the backseat of the 1957 Chevy you know in one in a one night of

600
00:47:58,009 --> 00:48:00,908
Half-drunk idiocy, not that but consciously

601
00:48:02,209 --> 00:48:07,569
consciously knowing what's to come and then also allows it to happen because that's another thing that's a

602
00:48:08,179 --> 00:48:14,379
Testament to the courage of mothers my mother was good at this my mother's a very agreeable person too agreeable for her own good

603
00:48:14,959 --> 00:48:20,529
But that's what happens if you're agreeable because you're too agreeable if your own good, that's the definition of agreeable

604
00:48:20,529 --> 00:48:27,549
And so she's a nice person, and it still is luckily she's still alive and we've had a very good relationship, and I have always

605
00:48:28,369 --> 00:48:35,978
been able to make her laugh, which is which is a good thing and but she was tough cookie that woman, you know if if

606
00:48:38,239 --> 00:48:40,239
remember once she came across I

607
00:48:40,819 --> 00:48:45,788
was out playing in this baseball diamond little diamond and

608
00:48:46,549 --> 00:48:49,119
Empty lot really in this little town. I grew up in and I

609
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:53,799
Was about ten and she walked by I was there with bunch of my friends

610
00:48:53,799 --> 00:48:58,418
and I was about to have a fistfight with this little tough kid that I hung around with and

611
00:48:59,239 --> 00:49:02,079
There were half girls on the team and this fight had

612
00:49:02,390 --> 00:49:05,019
Some relationship to status maneuvering

613
00:49:05,019 --> 00:49:05,900
you know in

614
00:49:05,900 --> 00:49:12,279
Relationship to that anyways, we're going to have a fight and my mom walked by she took a look and I could see from her

615
00:49:13,249 --> 00:49:17,228
Demeanor that she knew exactly what was about to happen and she looked

616
00:49:17,479 --> 00:49:24,129
For a second and then she walked by and I thought whoa good work mom, no kidding

617
00:49:24,130 --> 00:49:27,159
It's like last bloody thing I needed at that moment was

618
00:49:27,380 --> 00:49:33,640
For her to come charging up and say you boys aren't planning to have a fight. Are you it's like well yeah, mom

619
00:49:33,640 --> 00:49:40,689
We're we were actually planning to have a fight and now that you came and intervened. I actually lost before the goddamn saying even started

620
00:49:45,990 --> 00:49:47,810
So two thumbs up for Mom

621
00:49:47,810 --> 00:49:53,690
She was also the person that said because I had some trouble with my dad when I was you know it adolescence

622
00:49:53,910 --> 00:49:55,910
He had some trouble with me. So you know

623
00:49:56,790 --> 00:49:59,209
It was 50/50 that's for now. It's probably

624
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:07,070
70/30 with me on the seventy end of the being the trouble and anyways I left home when I was about Seventeen and

625
00:50:08,730 --> 00:50:15,740
She said something really interesting when I left home. She said it was too. Good at home. You never leave. I thought hey mom

626
00:50:15,740 --> 00:50:22,100
That's pretty good. You know for for an agreeable person. You've got a real spine man. So that was pretty good

627
00:50:22,860 --> 00:50:24,860
so

628
00:50:26,010 --> 00:50:29,959
So you know mother that's as this the mother into the person who also says

629
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:37,699
Get out there. Take your goddamn lumps because you're tough enough so that you can handle it. She doesn't say

630
00:50:38,460 --> 00:50:41,660
You just stay down there and your bedroom brooding away

631
00:50:42,360 --> 00:50:45,349
because the world is unfair and treating you badly and

632
00:50:46,050 --> 00:50:50,209
Your suffering is too much. She says yeah, there's a lot of suffering out there, but

633
00:50:50,730 --> 00:50:53,030
You're a hell of a lot tougher than you think you are

634
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:55,940
so

635
00:50:57,270 --> 00:51:00,590
In turn Mary's son Christ offers himself to God

636
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:07,789
So completely that his faith and trust in the world is not broken by Betrayal torture or death

637
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:15,289
That's the model for the honorable man, so

638
00:51:16,020 --> 00:51:21,229
You know you have an interesting dynamic there you have the woman who's willing to make the sacrifice

639
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:26,959
lays the groundwork for the son who is willing to make the sacrifice that

640
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:31,160
Works out pretty nicely and it's a good thing to know in

641
00:51:31,890 --> 00:51:34,459
Christ's Case however as he sacrifices himself

642
00:51:35,790 --> 00:51:37,790
God his father is

643
00:51:37,860 --> 00:51:42,920
Simultaneously sacrificing his son right that's one of the oddities of the trinitarian model is that God?

644
00:51:43,290 --> 00:51:47,180
Sacrifices himself to himself same thing happens in Norse Mythology, right?

645
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:52,100
Norse Zeus Germanic Mythology

646
00:51:52,950 --> 00:51:59,869
Zeus sacrifices himself to himself he actually hangs on a tree. It's actually wounded in his side. It's very interesting parallel

647
00:52:00,630 --> 00:52:02,630
But I think part of the idea is well

648
00:52:03,450 --> 00:52:07,309
The human Human Race is starting to work out. What's the ultimate sacrifice?

649
00:52:07,740 --> 00:52:12,589
it's something like that ultimate sacrifice of value well the the

650
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:17,960
Passion story, and I told you I was foreshadowing. I'm bringing cysts into

651
00:52:18,569 --> 00:52:22,189
Consideration things we won't talk about for a long time. Maybe not at all in this lecture series

652
00:52:22,190 --> 00:52:24,950
I don't know because I don't know how far. I'll get is that well

653
00:52:24,950 --> 00:52:28,819
There's a supreme sacrifice demanded on the part of the mother and there's a supreme sacrifice

654
00:52:29,069 --> 00:52:31,159
Demanded on the part of the son, and there's a supreme sacrifice

655
00:52:31,710 --> 00:52:36,889
Demanded on the part of the father all at the same time and then that makes the supreme sacrifice

656
00:52:37,410 --> 00:52:42,529
Possible and hypothetically, that's the one that renews. That's the sacrifice that renews and redeems

657
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:46,279
It's a hell of an idea man and the thing about it. Is that I?

658
00:52:47,490 --> 00:52:51,529
Don't know if it's true, but I know that its opposite is False

659
00:52:52,589 --> 00:52:56,778
And generally the opposite of something that's false is true

660
00:52:57,539 --> 00:52:59,480
It's it's opposite as False

661
00:52:59,480 --> 00:53:03,139
It's because if the mother doesn't make the sacrifice then you get the horrible eatable

662
00:53:03,210 --> 00:53:08,119
Situation or something like that in the household which is just its own absolute catastrophic hell

663
00:53:08,119 --> 00:53:12,499
And if you want a really good insight into that I would say watch the documentary crumb

664
00:53:12,990 --> 00:53:17,059
See Ru and be a man that's been rated by some critics as the best

665
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:19,700
Documentary ever made and it is some piece of work man

666
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:25,039
It is the only thing I've ever seen that actually lays out the eatable catastrophe, and it's full nightmare

667
00:53:25,260 --> 00:53:27,949
You know so you could you could look at that?

668
00:53:28,799 --> 00:53:32,389
so if the maternal sacrifice isn't there then that doesn't work if the

669
00:53:32,490 --> 00:53:36,229
paternal Sacrifice isn't there, you know if you're if the father isn't willing to

670
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:41,510
Put his son out into the world let's say to be broken and betrayed and all of those things then

671
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:46,309
That's a non-starter because the kid doesn't grow up, and then if the son isn't willing to do that well

672
00:53:46,309 --> 00:53:48,309
Then who the hell is going to shoulder the responsibility?

673
00:53:48,450 --> 00:53:53,629
So if those three things don't happen then it's cataclysmic

674
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:59,270
It's chaotic as hell. If they do happen is it the opposite of that well, you could say well

675
00:53:59,270 --> 00:54:03,589
Maybe it depends on the degree to which they happen and and it's a continuum

676
00:54:03,589 --> 00:54:08,449
How thoroughly can they happen well we don't know you know because you might say

677
00:54:10,680 --> 00:54:12,680
How good a job do you do?

678
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:14,809
Of encouraging your children to live in truth

679
00:54:15,270 --> 00:54:21,530
Let's say well, that's part of the answer to this question and the answer likely is well, not you

680
00:54:21,530 --> 00:54:25,759
Don't do as good a job of it as you could so it works out quite

681
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:25,790
well

682
00:54:25,790 --> 00:54:29,389
but you don't know how well it could work if you did it really well or

683
00:54:29,849 --> 00:54:32,719
Spectacularly well or ultimately well or something like that

684
00:54:32,720 --> 00:54:39,559
You don't know and you know people have an intonation of this because one of the things that's really cool about having a young, baby

685
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:43,009
This is something you don't know until you have it. There's two things you don't know

686
00:54:44,369 --> 00:54:46,578
Mmm. There's a lot more than two

687
00:54:47,849 --> 00:54:49,849
There's three things you don't know

688
00:54:50,970 --> 00:54:54,109
Until you have a baby the one is that you didn't grow up yet

689
00:54:54,839 --> 00:54:58,549
Because you actually don't grow up until someone else is more important than you you can't

690
00:54:58,770 --> 00:55:01,459
So people think they grow up if they don't have children

691
00:55:01,460 --> 00:55:06,230
but they don't they just think they do now there are some people who make sacrifices of other Sorts, but

692
00:55:06,900 --> 00:55:12,020
This is a whole different ball of wax as far as I'm concerned. It's not a very Elegant metaphor, but

693
00:55:15,329 --> 00:55:19,609
You learn that it's kind of relief relief not to be the center of attention. That's cool

694
00:55:20,130 --> 00:55:24,619
that you can sit back because of course your child in your family and

695
00:55:25,140 --> 00:55:27,440
in societies immediately the center of attention

696
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:32,780
and so unless you're narcissistic then you allow that to happen and

697
00:55:33,180 --> 00:55:38,240
Then you learn all sorts of really good things about other people because other people really like babies. It's so cool

698
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:44,540
I lived in Montreal when we had our first child and I lived in a pretty rough neighborhood by Montreal standards, right?

699
00:55:44,540 --> 00:55:49,069
It's like you know material has such a great city like Toronto. It's like even the rough neighborhoods

700
00:55:49,069 --> 00:55:54,619
Are they're more like charming with a little you know dark underbelly something like that

701
00:55:54,809 --> 00:55:57,289
But there were some rough characters in our neighborhood

702
00:55:57,290 --> 00:56:01,519
It was pretty poor and we'd we'd push her around in her stroller

703
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:04,879
And he's like grizzled rat dole guys would come by

704
00:56:04,890 --> 00:56:09,349
They'd look at her and they just light up and they'd come over and like smile at her

705
00:56:09,349 --> 00:56:15,349
And you know you just saw there the positive element of their humanity just well forth you

706
00:56:15,349 --> 00:56:19,639
Ask there s to be something seriously wrong with you if you don't respond that way to a baby you know

707
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:22,040
I mean, this is that that's not good

708
00:56:22,069 --> 00:56:22,880
That's not good

709
00:56:22,880 --> 00:56:25,220
But it was so cool to see these people you kind of give them

710
00:56:25,440 --> 00:56:30,960
Generally sort of walk four feet around them on the street. You know and yet. They were all of a sudden all that

711
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:38,849
The layers that were on them would just fall off and they'd be so and the babies are sort of like public property weirdly enough

712
00:56:38,849 --> 00:56:44,729
To sort of like pregnant women you know because people often treat pregnant women sort of like. They're public property too

713
00:56:44,730 --> 00:56:49,349
I mean in a positive way. Oh, whoa. Lord you would have a baby yeah, and you know they hey well

714
00:56:49,349 --> 00:56:51,349
They do all Sorts of cute things

715
00:56:51,730 --> 00:56:53,730
so

716
00:56:53,799 --> 00:56:56,729
So you know the reason I'm telling you that is because there's a strong

717
00:56:57,819 --> 00:57:00,778
Impulse in people to note that there's something

718
00:57:01,269 --> 00:57:08,489
Miraculous about the existence of a new human being and the Miraculous element is all the potential that's there right?

719
00:57:08,490 --> 00:57:10,949
That's all there. Is there is potential and

720
00:57:11,559 --> 00:57:14,369
With every birth. There's the potential for something

721
00:57:15,670 --> 00:57:17,670
remarkable to be

722
00:57:17,799 --> 00:57:23,429
Introduced in the world, and you know one of the things I've thought too is the other thing you don't know is that?

723
00:57:24,549 --> 00:57:27,629
babies are Generic until you have one and then

724
00:57:28,510 --> 00:57:32,159
Your baby, isn't a generic baby at all. It's like

725
00:57:33,549 --> 00:57:39,028
Instantly it's a person with whom you have a relationship that's closer perhaps than any relationship that you've ever had and that

726
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:41,490
You can keep perfect

727
00:57:41,650 --> 00:57:47,849
right because most of the relationships you've had already are with people who are screwed up in 50 different ways and so are you but

728
00:57:47,849 --> 00:57:53,429
Here you've got this baby and like it be care, but it's not rained yet and so

729
00:57:53,950 --> 00:57:57,179
You know you have this possibility of maintaining this relationship?

730
00:57:57,910 --> 00:58:00,960
that starts out that baby really likes you and

731
00:58:01,420 --> 00:58:05,819
Generally that continues for quite a long time as there are two years old you come home

732
00:58:05,819 --> 00:58:09,869
They're really happy to see it's kind of like having a puppy. You know. It's like. They're thrilled when you come home

733
00:58:09,940 --> 00:58:14,609
It's like how many people are thrilled when you come home, you know so he'll see you again. It's like

734
00:58:14,609 --> 00:58:17,249
No, not a little kid a little kid is thrilled when you come home?

735
00:58:17,250 --> 00:58:24,509
and you can keep that going and so there's this pristine element to the potential relationship between

736
00:58:25,210 --> 00:58:28,889
Parents and children that's Terribly devalued in our society terribly

737
00:58:30,190 --> 00:58:37,799
It's almost as if we're willfully blind to it, and I think it's an absolute catastrophe because there's nothing is very little in life that

738
00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:43,139
Can compare to establishing a proper relationship with with child?

739
00:58:44,289 --> 00:58:46,289
They make great company a few

740
00:58:46,959 --> 00:58:49,709
if you keep your relationship with them Christine

741
00:58:50,380 --> 00:58:53,369
And so you know it's worthwhile, you think well

742
00:58:53,369 --> 00:58:56,818
I'm so so the reason I'm telling you. This is because people look at infants, and they think

743
00:58:57,429 --> 00:59:00,209
They think this could be the potential savior of mankind

744
00:59:00,819 --> 00:59:03,508
That is what they think that's how they act

745
00:59:04,749 --> 00:59:08,849
So that's what they think and the thing is it's also true

746
00:59:10,569 --> 00:59:12,569
Now how true it is I don't know

747
00:59:15,189 --> 00:59:23,129
But that's I think probably because I think it's probably because people don't dare to find out that's how it looks to me

748
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:27,400
in

749
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:29,729
Christ's Case however as he sacrifices himself

750
00:59:29,859 --> 00:59:34,828
God his father is simultaneously sacrificing his son it is for this reason that the Christian

751
00:59:35,199 --> 00:59:41,639
Sacrificial drama of son and self is archetypal nothing greater can be imagined. That's why it's an architect

752
00:59:41,640 --> 00:59:44,369
You can't push past it

753
00:59:45,489 --> 00:59:47,489
so

754
00:59:49,150 --> 00:59:52,979
That's the very definition of archetypal. That's the core of what constitutes religious

755
00:59:54,009 --> 00:59:57,509
the greatest of all possible sacrifices is self and child of

756
00:59:57,699 --> 01:00:03,688
that there can be no doubt pain and suffering define the world of that equally there can be no doubt the

757
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:10,829
Person who wants to alleviate suffering who wants to bring about the best of all possible futures who wants to create heaven on Earth?

758
01:00:11,319 --> 01:00:14,188
Will therefore sacrifice everything he has to God?

759
01:00:14,799 --> 01:00:16,799
to life in the truth

760
01:00:18,609 --> 01:00:23,848
So that's a page and a half from the book. I'm going to release in January

761
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:36,149
so back to genesis that were all we already up to genesis four and

762
01:00:37,480 --> 01:00:39,510
Adam knew Eve his wife and she

763
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:43,380
conceived and

764
01:00:43,869 --> 01:00:47,999
Bare cain and said I have gotten a man from the Lord now

765
01:00:48,910 --> 01:00:54,270
This is after Adam and eve have been chased out of the garden of Eden right, so what's really cool about this

766
01:00:54,270 --> 01:00:59,070
I really think that the out of the cain and Abel story is the most profound story. I've ever read

767
01:00:59,890 --> 01:01:03,510
Especially given that it's you can tell it in 15 seconds

768
01:01:03,510 --> 01:01:09,719
I won't because I tend not to tell stories in 15 seconds as you may have noticed but but you can read the whole thing

769
01:01:10,180 --> 01:01:11,859
that quickly and

770
01:01:11,859 --> 01:01:16,619
It's so densely packed that. I just can't it's it's actually

771
01:01:17,410 --> 01:01:21,359
Unbelievable to me that it can be that densely packed okay, so the first thing is is that

772
01:01:22,510 --> 01:01:27,330
Adam and eve are not the first two human beings can enable are the first two human beings

773
01:01:28,359 --> 01:01:33,509
Given Adam and Eve were made by God and they were born in paradises like what kind of human beings are those you don't know

774
01:01:33,510 --> 01:01:35,609
Any human beings like that human beings aren't?

775
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:41,730
Born in Paradise and made by God human beings are born of other human beings

776
01:01:42,220 --> 01:01:49,139
Right and so so that's the first thing and it's post-fall. We're out in the world world in history now. We're not in some

777
01:01:49,750 --> 01:01:53,909
Archetypal Beyond although, we are still to some degree not to the degree

778
01:01:53,910 --> 01:01:59,430
That was the case with the story of Adam and eve. We've already been thrown out of the garden. We're already self-conscious

779
01:01:59,609 --> 01:02:03,959
We're already awake. We're already covered. We're already working

780
01:02:04,599 --> 01:02:08,819
We're full-fledged human beings and so you have the first two human beings

781
01:02:09,970 --> 01:02:11,560
can enable

782
01:02:11,560 --> 01:02:14,009
Prototypical human beings, so what's cool?

783
01:02:14,010 --> 01:02:21,719
Is that humanity enters history at the end of the story of Adam and Eve and then the archetypal patterns for human Behavior are?

784
01:02:22,690 --> 01:02:26,609
Instantaneously presented it's it's it's absolutely

785
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:34,019
Mind-boggling and it's not a great. It's not a very nice story, right, so they're they're brothers. They're are hostile brothers

786
01:02:34,020 --> 01:02:40,619
They've got their their their hands around each other's throat, so to speak or at least that's the case in One direction

787
01:02:40,619 --> 01:02:44,459
So it's a it's a story the first two human beings

788
01:02:45,300 --> 01:02:47,300
engage in a fratricidal

789
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:52,199
Struggle that ends in the death of the best one of them

790
01:02:53,530 --> 01:02:56,699
that's the story of human beings in history and

791
01:02:57,580 --> 01:03:02,759
That man that doesn't give you nightmares. You didn't understand the damn story

792
01:03:05,710 --> 01:03:11,160
Now in in these hostile brother stories which are very very common

793
01:03:12,520 --> 01:03:14,580
often the older brother cain is

794
01:03:15,370 --> 01:03:20,519
Used and this is very true in the Bible, but it's true in all sorts of folktales and all sorts of stories

795
01:03:21,070 --> 01:03:23,070
of all sorts for that matter

796
01:03:23,590 --> 01:03:27,209
See the older brother has some advantages. He's the older brother in a

797
01:03:28,450 --> 01:03:30,450
agricultural Community the Older Brother

798
01:03:30,910 --> 01:03:32,910
generally inherited the land

799
01:03:33,790 --> 01:03:37,979
Not the younger brothers and the reason for that was is that well let's say you have like eight sons

800
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:42,060
And you have enough land to support a bit of a family and you divide it among your eight sons

801
01:03:42,190 --> 01:03:45,060
Then they have eight sons and they divided among the eight sons

802
01:03:45,060 --> 01:03:45,700
it's like

803
01:03:45,700 --> 01:03:53,130
Soon everyone has a little postage stamp that they can stand on and starve to death on and so that just doesn't work so you

804
01:03:53,260 --> 01:03:58,410
You you you hand the land down in a piece to the eldest son, and that's just how it is

805
01:03:58,410 --> 01:04:00,270
It's tough luck for the rest of them

806
01:04:00,270 --> 01:04:03,239
But at least they know they're going to have to go and make their own way

807
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:06,900
It's not fair, but there's no way of making it fair

808
01:04:07,750 --> 01:04:09,780
well, so the oldest son has some

809
01:04:10,510 --> 01:04:13,290
you might say he has an additional stake in the

810
01:04:14,110 --> 01:04:16,110
stability and

811
01:04:16,330 --> 01:04:20,669
And the stability of the current hierarchy he has more of a stake in the status quo

812
01:04:20,670 --> 01:04:23,970
So that makes a more of an emblematic represent

813
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:30,359
Representative of the status quo, and perhaps more likely to be blind in its favor. It's something like that

814
01:04:30,360 --> 01:04:37,499
So that motif creeps up very frequently in the Hostile brothers archetypal struggled so cain

815
01:04:38,320 --> 01:04:43,709
fits this the story of cain and Abel fits this pattern because cain is the one who won't budge who won't move

816
01:04:43,900 --> 01:04:48,299
He's stubborn, Whereas the younger son. Who's abel is often the one who's more?

817
01:04:48,910 --> 01:04:55,049
Not so much of a revolutionary, but perhaps more of a balance between the revolutionary and the traditionalist something like that

818
01:04:55,120 --> 01:04:57,150
Whereas the older son tends to be more

819
01:04:59,140 --> 01:05:00,340
traditionalist

820
01:05:00,340 --> 01:05:02,340
Authoritarian at least in these

821
01:05:02,350 --> 01:05:04,350
metaphorical representations an

822
01:05:04,780 --> 01:05:10,439
Adam knew eve his wife and she conceived and bare cain and said I have gotten a man from the Lord, so

823
01:05:11,110 --> 01:05:16,649
There's the first human being cain. It's like I told you that the mesopotamians thought that mankind

824
01:05:17,890 --> 01:05:22,590
Was made out of the blood of the worst Demon that the great goddess of Chaos could imagine?

825
01:05:23,260 --> 01:05:27,959
Well the first human being is a murderer and not only a murderer a murder of his own brother

826
01:05:27,960 --> 01:05:33,600
And so you know old testament that's a hell of a harsh book and you might think well

827
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:37,799
maybe that's a little bit too much to bear and then you might think yeah and

828
01:05:38,650 --> 01:05:43,620
Maybe it's true too. So that's something to think about I mean I

829
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:47,400
human beings you know like

830
01:05:48,580 --> 01:05:56,489
They're amazing creatures, and to think about us as a plague on the planet is its own kind of bloody catastrophe

831
01:05:57,310 --> 01:05:59,310
Malevolent Low

832
01:06:02,650 --> 01:06:04,650
Quasi Genocide all metaphor

833
01:06:05,020 --> 01:06:07,080
But that doesn't mean that we're not without our

834
01:06:07,150 --> 01:06:12,120
Problems and the fact that this book that sets sits at the Cornerstone of our culture would

835
01:06:13,990 --> 01:06:21,090
present the first man because a murderer of his brother is something that should really set you back on your heels and

836
01:06:23,530 --> 01:06:28,139
Again, she bear his brother abel and abel was a keeper of sheep, but cain was a tiller of the ground

837
01:06:29,260 --> 01:06:31,260
There you see a very old

838
01:06:31,450 --> 01:06:33,370
representation there's

839
01:06:33,370 --> 01:06:34,080
Abel there

840
01:06:34,080 --> 01:06:41,699
And he's got his sheep up on the altar and cain is bringing a sheaf of wheat and I don't know exactly what's happening here

841
01:06:42,490 --> 01:06:46,469
With the blood but or it's a ray perhaps

842
01:06:46,470 --> 01:06:51,990
It's something like that, but the overall impression of the image is that something transcendent is

843
01:06:53,110 --> 01:06:54,600
communicating with this sacrifice

844
01:06:54,600 --> 01:07:01,709
And you can see that so you think oh how primitive you know how primitive these people were sacrificing to their God

845
01:07:01,710 --> 01:07:03,710
It's like you know

846
01:07:04,780 --> 01:07:08,189
Those people weren't stupid and this is not primitive

847
01:07:08,830 --> 01:07:12,269
Whatever it is. It's not permitted. It's sophisticated Beyond belief because

848
01:07:12,870 --> 01:07:17,609
The idea as I already pointed out is that you could sacrifice something of value and that that would have

849
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:20,939
Transcendent utility and that is by no means an unsophisticated

850
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:25,499
idea in fact it might be the great idea that human beings ever came up with

851
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:30,750
It's an answer to the problem. That's put forward in

852
01:07:31,270 --> 01:07:34,620
The story of Adam and Eve right because we became self conscious

853
01:07:34,620 --> 01:07:39,509
and then we discovered the future and then we knew we were going to die and then we knew we were vulnerable and then we

854
01:07:39,510 --> 01:07:43,439
Became ashamed and then we developed the knowledge of good and evil, and then we got thrown out of

855
01:07:43,990 --> 01:07:48,420
Paradise is like. That's a big problem. So what the hell are you going to do about it? Well?

856
01:07:49,660 --> 01:07:55,079
Sacrifice that's the hypothesis. Well that's a hell of a hypothesis man. That's what we're doing

857
01:07:55,080 --> 01:07:57,660
you've made plenty of sacrifices even to sit in this

858
01:07:58,210 --> 01:08:05,310
Theater and many people made plenty of sacrifices to have a theater like this existed many people made sacrifices

859
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:11,100
So that we could actually freely engage in the dialogue that we're engaging in in a theater like this

860
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:17,910
And so it's like all of this is built on sacrifice and sacrifice bloody well better work because we do not have a better idea

861
01:08:20,440 --> 01:08:22,440
Sacrifice what's the counter position?

862
01:08:22,780 --> 01:08:24,780
murder and Theft

863
01:08:24,819 --> 01:08:32,489
So let's go with sacrifice shall we and perhaps. We won't consider it. So damn primitive. You know because it's not so primitive and

864
01:08:33,040 --> 01:08:38,189
Again, she Barrett his brother abel and abel was a keeper of sheep and cain was a tiller of the ground

865
01:08:40,690 --> 01:08:42,899
now some people have read into this the

866
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:46,470
Eternal Battle between Herdsmen and

867
01:08:47,589 --> 01:08:55,499
Agriculturalists, it's raged in the American west for example because the Herdsmen like to have their herds sheep cattle go

868
01:08:55,500 --> 01:09:00,479
wherever they were going to go and of course they had your cultures the farmers like to have things fenced off and

869
01:09:00,790 --> 01:09:04,919
So and the agriculturalists actually won in the final analysis

870
01:09:06,339 --> 01:09:11,459
But anyways abel is a keeper of sheep, and that's interesting because that makes them a shepherd

871
01:09:13,330 --> 01:09:17,160
and I think that's part of the critical issue here because a shepherd I

872
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:23,519
Talked a little bit about shepherds before you know if you look at Michelangelo's statue of David which is another?

873
01:09:25,210 --> 01:09:28,200
Stay during work. I mean that David. He's no

874
01:09:29,650 --> 01:09:31,650
Trivial figure and of course

875
01:09:34,150 --> 01:09:37,350
David who Slays Goliath right and Goliath is like

876
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:41,970
the giant of the patriarchal enemy, it's something like that and

877
01:09:42,550 --> 01:09:47,009
You know middle Eastern shepherds they had to keep take care of sheep

878
01:09:47,010 --> 01:09:52,949
And they're edible and the lambs are very vulnerable and there were lots of wild animals around. It wasn't like

879
01:09:53,650 --> 01:09:55,290
England in the 16th Century

880
01:09:55,290 --> 01:09:57,840
it was like there were lions you know and

881
01:09:57,970 --> 01:10:02,610
You had a slingshot or a stick or some damn thing and so your job was to keep the sheep

882
01:10:03,010 --> 01:10:07,079
organized and not let them eat by the lions alone and so

883
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:13,139
you had to have a clue and be tough and self-reliant and all of those things had to be tough and

884
01:10:13,420 --> 01:10:18,600
self-reliant you had to be able to take care of a lot of vulnerable things at build do it on your own and

885
01:10:18,730 --> 01:10:20,970
So that's all built into the shepherd

886
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,190
Metaphor and it's you know

887
01:10:23,190 --> 01:10:28,830
It's a tough thing for it's not a great metaphor for modern people because we tend to think of the shepherd is someone like little

888
01:10:28,830 --> 01:10:31,289
Lord Fauntleroy, you know like some little

889
01:10:32,410 --> 01:10:34,410
Certainly not a lion killing

890
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:38,070
Hyper-Masculine Lion killing you know monster

891
01:10:38,070 --> 01:10:44,399
That's not a shepherd the shepherd sort of dances around and you know it's not that's not the metaphor here. That's that's

892
01:10:45,100 --> 01:10:47,939
That's not the metaphor here so abel was a keeper of sheep

893
01:10:47,940 --> 01:10:50,130
but cain was a tiller of the ground and

894
01:10:50,470 --> 01:10:56,130
In the process of time it came to pass that cain brought of the fruit of the ground an offering unto the Lord

895
01:10:57,070 --> 01:11:04,769
okay, so he's participating in the sacrificial ritual and abel he brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof and the

896
01:11:05,110 --> 01:11:07,739
Lord had respect unto Abel and to his offering

897
01:11:10,240 --> 01:11:14,340
Now you don't know why that is and this is a built-in ambiguity I think

898
01:11:15,880 --> 01:11:18,899
Now I think there's textual hints, but I'm not sure

899
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:25,710
Abel brought the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof okay, so so, what does that mean well?

900
01:11:26,680 --> 01:11:32,519
He brought high courts a high quality sacrifice. You don't know that Abel's sacrifice is low quality

901
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:39,300
Because it doesn't say you know abel brought. God some wilted lettuce and then burnt it he didn't say that

902
01:11:40,000 --> 01:11:43,089
but but there isn't a sentence there that talks about how

903
01:11:44,810 --> 01:11:47,499
high-Quality cain sacrifices

904
01:11:48,830 --> 01:11:51,939
But in any case the Lord had respect unto Abel and his offering

905
01:11:53,000 --> 01:12:00,069
So there's a hint that abel's putting a little bit more into the whole sacrificial thing than then cain

906
01:12:00,440 --> 01:12:06,640
But there's also a hint that maybe God is just like liking you a little better than he's like in him, and that's I think

907
01:12:07,250 --> 01:12:13,569
Useful from a literary perspective because there is that arbitrariness about life you know with my own children for example

908
01:12:14,510 --> 01:12:16,630
One of them has had I would say

909
01:12:18,170 --> 01:12:19,460
heat

910
01:12:19,460 --> 01:12:21,460
things come easy to him

911
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:23,920
He's lucky fortunate

912
01:12:24,290 --> 01:12:30,189
However, you want to put it. He seems to be that sort of person. Where's my other child. It's like. It's just like one

913
01:12:30,980 --> 01:12:38,740
horrible job like Catastrophe after another and it's so strange to see that because as far as I can tell there's

914
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:41,680
the character logical differences are

915
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:46,360
Certainly not accounting for the for the for the difference in destiny

916
01:12:46,550 --> 01:12:51,130
You know my want the one child who's had so much trouble. I mean as a child

917
01:12:52,250 --> 01:12:55,180
was just a wonderful child so

918
01:13:02,170 --> 01:13:06,239
Mazing ly happy and easy to long with and fun

919
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:10,800
and

920
01:13:11,230 --> 01:13:16,650
Had a terrible time of it. So who knows what god's up to

921
01:13:18,880 --> 01:13:22,109
But distributing fate equally certainly isn't one of them

922
01:13:23,500 --> 01:13:30,900
And the Lord had respect unto abel and his offering but unto cain and his offering he had not respect

923
01:13:33,430 --> 01:13:35,729
And cain was very roth angry

924
01:13:36,430 --> 01:13:40,260
Roth is a tough word. You know when these are translated many times

925
01:13:40,260 --> 01:13:46,889
It's hard to get the full flavor of the words, but roth and his countenance fell well to have your countenance fell

926
01:13:46,890 --> 01:13:49,380
This is sort of up to fall is to

927
01:13:50,140 --> 01:13:52,320
To have it be heavy depressed

928
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:56,879
For sure angry for sure resentful

929
01:13:58,120 --> 01:14:03,300
Probably roth that's anger so cain is not a happy clam

930
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:09,179
That his hard work is being rejected by God now. That's worth thinking about

931
01:14:09,670 --> 01:14:14,609
Really because you think about how human that story is you know you're out

932
01:14:15,520 --> 01:14:17,610
There well we could say

933
01:14:18,160 --> 01:14:20,220
You might be a useless character

934
01:14:20,220 --> 01:14:22,289
And you know you're whining about how catastrophic

935
01:14:22,420 --> 01:14:27,599
Your life is and it's a pretty much obvious to everyone around you and you that it's your fault

936
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:31,650
You just don't try you don't wake up in the morning. You don't get a job

937
01:14:31,930 --> 01:14:35,220
You don't engage in things you're cynical and you're bitter

938
01:14:35,220 --> 01:14:38,610
And you're angry and you don't try to help the people near you

939
01:14:38,610 --> 01:14:44,009
and you don't try to fix up your own life and you don't take care of yourself, and you know and

940
01:14:44,650 --> 01:14:50,909
Then things go wrong. It's like well really what do you expect but then but that's done

941
01:14:50,910 --> 01:14:56,460
I mean that doesn't mean someone in that situation will just say well, that's okay. I deserve it and they'll be happy about it

942
01:14:56,460 --> 01:14:59,849
They won't they'll be absolutely bitter about it and angry, but you know

943
01:15:00,370 --> 01:15:04,079
Put that aside for a moment there are people who seem to struggle very

944
01:15:05,110 --> 01:15:10,709
Forthrightly let's say and still have one catastrophe after another happened to them and so

945
01:15:11,260 --> 01:15:14,489
It's there's no easy answer in this in this

946
01:15:15,570 --> 01:15:17,570
It's like you can

947
01:15:17,710 --> 01:15:20,490
fall fall afoul of God

948
01:15:21,100 --> 01:15:26,160
Because your sacrifice is our second rate or you can just fall a fall of God

949
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:34,050
And you don't know why well tough luck for you, and then what happens in either case is exactly this almost inevitably

950
01:15:35,800 --> 01:15:39,300
Cain was rocked in this countenance fell well you know you meet and I

951
01:15:39,760 --> 01:15:44,939
people like this write to me all the time I've seen so many many of them as clients you know they say they're

952
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:50,339
20 not so often 30 more commonly sometimes 40 their lives haven't gone

953
01:15:50,340 --> 01:15:56,250
Well, you know they're in a pit of despair of one form or another and not only are they in a pit of despair

954
01:15:56,260 --> 01:16:01,260
But they're extraordinarily angry about it, and God only knows what they would do with that anger if they had the opportunity

955
01:16:01,810 --> 01:16:03,810
To give it full voice

956
01:16:04,360 --> 01:16:09,600
Right you know one of the things I've always thought about hitler. Is that you know people

957
01:16:11,140 --> 01:16:13,800
You have to admire Hitler. That's the thing

958
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:16,440
Because he was an organizational genius

959
01:16:17,110 --> 01:16:21,990
You know the thing that doesn't stop people from being hitler the thing

960
01:16:22,870 --> 01:16:24,870
people don't

961
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:27,120
people don't

962
01:16:27,970 --> 01:16:30,300
Refuse the ambition to become hitler

963
01:16:30,820 --> 01:16:33,600
Because they don't have the genocide emotive ation

964
01:16:34,150 --> 01:16:38,490
They don't follow that pathway because they don't have the organizational genius

965
01:16:39,250 --> 01:16:41,230
They've got the damn

966
01:16:41,230 --> 01:16:49,080
Motivation and you know if you take a hundred people randomly, and you talk to them and you really talk to them you'll find that

967
01:16:49,690 --> 01:16:53,160
Five percent of them would take their vengeful thoughts

968
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:58,889
Pretty damn far if they were just given the opportunity and in fact they do because they make life

969
01:16:59,200 --> 01:17:05,249
Miserable for themselves and often for their family and sometimes for anybody they can come near and then maybe another

970
01:17:05,740 --> 01:17:12,569
Twenty percent of people have that bubble up in them on a pretty damn regular basis, so you

971
01:17:13,330 --> 01:17:17,999
Know you can have some sympathy for cain if you don't have any sympathy for cain, then you're not

972
01:17:19,840 --> 01:17:24,960
So you can't enable also they don't just represent to our contempo types of being they represent

973
01:17:26,200 --> 01:17:32,519
So it's not like you're cain, and you're able in here cain. You're able. It's like you're half-and-half, and you're half-and-half, and you're half-and-half

974
01:17:32,520 --> 01:17:39,689
It's something like this. This is two different potential patterns of destiny, and you don't manifest one purely and the other zero

975
01:17:39,690 --> 01:17:44,520
It's like you're it's it's like the line between good and Evil that runs down the human heart

976
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:49,290
It's exactly the same idea and maybe you're more like cain, or maybe you're more like Abel

977
01:17:49,290 --> 01:17:54,660
But they're still a little cain in you. No matter how able you are and maybe more than a little and

978
01:17:55,240 --> 01:18:00,629
Probably more than a litter little and if you watch your fantasies, which I would very much recommend

979
01:18:01,270 --> 01:18:03,270
you'll find that they

980
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:07,979
Show you dark things about you. That will shock you if you

981
01:18:08,950 --> 01:18:12,240
Allow yourself to be conscious of what you're thinking, so

982
01:18:14,110 --> 01:18:18,600
It's a good time when you're having an argument with someone especially someone that you love

983
01:18:18,790 --> 01:18:22,140
To just watch the pictures that flash in the back of your mind

984
01:18:22,140 --> 01:18:29,519
That's part of let's say coming into contact with what carl jung called the shadow and the shadow is the manifestation of cain

985
01:18:29,680 --> 01:18:34,169
That's a perfect way of thinking about it and one of the things that jung said about the shadow

986
01:18:34,240 --> 01:18:36,959
Because jung was not someone you mess around with lightly

987
01:18:37,060 --> 01:18:44,220
He said the human shadow has roots that reach all the way to hell and jung meant that that's no metaphor for him now

988
01:18:44,220 --> 01:18:49,889
He might not have meant it in the same way that a fundamentalist Christian from from the Southern us

989
01:18:50,200 --> 01:18:56,609
Might mean it but I would say that young men sit in a way, that's far more terrifying and also far more true

990
01:18:57,670 --> 01:18:59,670
so and

991
01:18:59,830 --> 01:19:02,490
cain was very wroth and his countenance fell

992
01:19:07,030 --> 01:19:09,030
So there's abel

993
01:19:09,730 --> 01:19:11,730
Burning is offering away there

994
01:19:12,670 --> 01:19:14,670
and he's in this sort of

995
01:19:15,280 --> 01:19:16,480
relationship with

996
01:19:16,480 --> 01:19:18,220
Let's call him

997
01:19:18,220 --> 01:19:19,630
the

998
01:19:19,630 --> 01:19:21,630
archetypal figure of

999
01:19:23,170 --> 01:19:25,649
Culture the archetypal father and

1000
01:19:26,890 --> 01:19:33,390
it's something he respects that's the thing it's an indication that the posture is an indication of respect and

1001
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:38,339
then there's cain in the background you see in his face is in Shadow and he's

1002
01:19:40,780 --> 01:19:47,469
He's jealous of what's happening here, and he's going through the motions perhaps, and maybe God just doesn't like him

1003
01:19:47,469 --> 01:19:51,459
We don't know, but he's going through the motions and he's not very happy about it

1004
01:19:53,150 --> 01:19:57,580
And you know that that's actually a phrase that you could you could carve into many people's

1005
01:19:58,310 --> 01:20:04,239
Tombstones as an epitaph for their life which would be went through the motions, but wasn't very happy about it

1006
01:20:11,000 --> 01:20:18,040
This is really an interesting one. I think I mean so I don't know what God is doing here exactly but

1007
01:20:18,680 --> 01:20:21,399
He's helping ignite the sacrificial flame

1008
01:20:22,190 --> 01:20:25,419
And that's kind of an interesting idea. I think because

1009
01:20:26,390 --> 01:20:30,160
You know let's say that you have an impulse to make a sacrifice you think

1010
01:20:30,830 --> 01:20:34,989
Well, I should change this about my life. Well. It's like where does that come from that impulse

1011
01:20:35,270 --> 01:20:40,779
It's just well, just it manifests itself out of nothing so or you came up with it

1012
01:20:40,780 --> 01:20:42,780
Well, you might want to stop thinking about that

1013
01:20:43,280 --> 01:20:48,940
Thinking so surely that you come up with your own thoughts. You don't come up with your damn dreams. Do you?

1014
01:20:49,610 --> 01:20:51,530
They just happen

1015
01:20:51,530 --> 01:20:58,060
Kanade only knows where they come from they come from your brain. Oh boy. That's a sophisticated answer they come from your unconscious

1016
01:20:58,250 --> 01:21:00,850
Well, that's not much better at least it's somewhat better

1017
01:21:00,850 --> 01:21:06,459
But there are those matan amazing dramas take place in the theater of your imagination at night?

1018
01:21:06,460 --> 01:21:13,569
You don't even understand what they are and yet they occur night after night and those things dreams. They can contain wisdom. It's just

1019
01:21:14,660 --> 01:21:20,319
Well it just staggers the person who has the dream once they get the key to the dream once they remember it's like

1020
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:25,299
Oh look you just revealed a bunch of wisdom to yourself that you didn't know well. Where'd that come from?

1021
01:21:26,330 --> 01:21:30,009
Well, you don't know how in the world can you dream up things that you don't know?

1022
01:21:30,860 --> 01:21:36,460
That's a tough one. Maybe we'll talk about that at some point in this lecture series because there are some

1023
01:21:37,190 --> 01:21:40,270
Reasonable things that can be said about that, but you know the idea that

1024
01:21:41,960 --> 01:21:45,580
There's something that's not you young would call it the self karl

1025
01:21:45,580 --> 01:21:50,379
You would call it the self which he thought of as the totality of your being across time and space

1026
01:21:50,449 --> 01:21:54,369
it's something like that and that you know each second that you exist is a

1027
01:21:54,890 --> 01:21:56,539
slice

1028
01:21:56,539 --> 01:22:01,839
Manifesting itself across time and space, and he thought of the the self is partly the voice of conscience

1029
01:22:02,119 --> 01:22:09,009
Whatever that is that helps guide you when you have to make a difficult decision and a difficult decision might be well

1030
01:22:09,010 --> 01:22:15,820
What do I need to sacrifice? What is how do I need to discipline myself right? What do I need to forego well?

1031
01:22:15,979 --> 01:22:18,159
How do you figure those things out well?

1032
01:22:18,159 --> 01:22:24,788
You know this picture is trying to put forth the idea that perhaps if you had established the proper relationship with God the father

1033
01:22:25,070 --> 01:22:31,840
We've talked about what that might mean then he would help figure out how to get the sacrificial fires burning

1034
01:22:31,849 --> 01:22:38,049
So that you could stay in a proper relationship with him across time well, that's such an unreasonable

1035
01:22:38,570 --> 01:22:40,570
Proposition it what's the alternative?

1036
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:42,320
proposition

1037
01:22:42,320 --> 01:22:48,789
Well this isn't working out very well. That's for sure. You know kate seems to be doing it. I don't know what it is

1038
01:22:48,789 --> 01:22:54,639
It's like it's as if he thinks he can only do it himself or maybe he wants only to take credit for it or something

1039
01:22:54,639 --> 01:22:56,639
Like that he's not in this

1040
01:22:59,749 --> 01:23:03,369
Grateful let's say and inquiring grateful and inquiring

1041
01:23:04,729 --> 01:23:12,039
Posture because that's what a perfect posture should be it should be grateful and inquiring and grateful is thank God things aren't worse for me

1042
01:23:12,039 --> 01:23:13,309
Than they are

1043
01:23:13,309 --> 01:23:19,509
And you should be grateful about that because they could be a lot worse than they are man. They can be so bad and

1044
01:23:20,150 --> 01:23:26,619
Inquiring would be well. I don't really know how I could make it better, but I'm open to suggestions man

1045
01:23:26,619 --> 01:23:28,619
If I can figure out how to do it, I'll try it

1046
01:23:28,780 --> 01:23:36,039
That's the in that's the humility and the inquiry that's a humble inquiry. How could I make things better?

1047
01:23:36,039 --> 01:23:40,389
It's something like that, and that's like what sacrifices. Do I need to make in order to make things better

1048
01:23:40,880 --> 01:23:42,880
That's a good question to ask yourself

1049
01:23:43,219 --> 01:23:45,219
You could ask yourself that every morning

1050
01:23:46,369 --> 01:23:52,029
What sacrifice do I have to make to make things better you can decide what constitutes better?

1051
01:23:52,039 --> 01:23:57,009
How about that then it's not even as if it's being imposed on you come up with your own notion of what?

1052
01:23:57,139 --> 01:24:03,368
Constitutes better you know we try to make it sophisticated should just be better for you cuz that isn't going to work very well

1053
01:24:03,369 --> 01:24:08,919
Right you you're just going to fall downstairs if you do that because you have to live with other people and decide

1054
01:24:09,079 --> 01:24:11,079
Stupid anyways. What are you gonna? Do like?

1055
01:24:12,500 --> 01:24:15,640
Can't even nothing you can even say about that. It's so

1056
01:24:16,190 --> 01:24:20,530
That that's the doubts the attitude of a very badly behaved hyper aggressive

1057
01:24:20,930 --> 01:24:25,119
two-year-Old and I mean that technically and so you could

1058
01:24:26,000 --> 01:24:31,419
You could ask yourself well how I have this day that lays itself out in front of me

1059
01:24:31,790 --> 01:24:35,080
What thing could I let go of that's impeding my progress?

1060
01:24:36,140 --> 01:24:39,130
That if I let go of would make my life better

1061
01:24:39,130 --> 01:24:43,839
My Family's life better my cultures life better my being better

1062
01:24:43,840 --> 01:24:49,929
And then that would give you something to do for the day wouldn't it and to justify your miserable life

1063
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:57,760
Because you need that that's the whole point of the first story of Adam, and eve. What do you have a miserable life?

1064
01:24:58,460 --> 01:25:00,440
Okay

1065
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:02,240
What am I going to do about that?

1066
01:25:02,240 --> 01:25:08,559
Well if you just have a miserable life you're just going to suffer stupidly and get bitter about it. That's what happens to cain

1067
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:14,320
It's like well. How about not doing that because that seems to just take a bad deal and make it worse. How about?

1068
01:25:15,350 --> 01:25:20,350
Making a sacrifice and seeing if you can please God and put being on track

1069
01:25:21,200 --> 01:25:27,429
God that'd be something to do what could be better than that. What could possibly be better than that

1070
01:25:28,580 --> 01:25:33,700
Well, that's why it's archetypal man, because nothing's better than that. That's where it tops out

1071
01:25:34,550 --> 01:25:39,309
So when you can do that you can do that every day you have to do it a little way because like

1072
01:25:39,620 --> 01:25:42,160
what good are you you know you're not going to go and

1073
01:25:43,400 --> 01:25:46,870
Bring this socialist utopia into being in one fell swoop

1074
01:25:58,409 --> 01:26:02,058
You might also think that you know one of the things came might figure out here

1075
01:26:02,059 --> 01:26:04,609
There's a couple of things that just aren't going right for him

1076
01:26:05,729 --> 01:26:10,639
downwind of the fire not the right place to blow from and

1077
01:26:11,309 --> 01:26:16,998
The fact that he's in hand velop tin haze and smoke and breathing it in and the fire isn't burning

1078
01:26:17,459 --> 01:26:24,229
Might be an indication that he's doing something wrong or he could be wiping his eyes and saying Jesus

1079
01:26:24,229 --> 01:26:31,458
What kind of stupid bloody universe would produce smoke like this? It's like yes, well, that's the more likely outcome and

1080
01:26:33,090 --> 01:26:39,079
The Lord said unto cain why art thou wroth and why is thy countenance fallen?

1081
01:26:40,380 --> 01:26:41,400
if

1082
01:26:41,400 --> 01:26:44,900
Thou doest well shalt thou would not be accepted now

1083
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:51,859
That's an interesting line because and I've looked at a variety of different translations of this this

1084
01:26:52,320 --> 01:26:54,469
Seventh verse here like a bunch of them because

1085
01:26:55,320 --> 01:27:01,729
The translation for that that's a critical line and the translation really matters and so I'll tell you what I think the story is

1086
01:27:01,919 --> 01:27:03,919
but I've been able to figure out and

1087
01:27:04,320 --> 01:27:06,679
I'm sure I haven't got it completely right, but it's

1088
01:27:09,179 --> 01:27:15,379
So he asks the God says to them if you do well won't you be accepted. What is the hint there, right?

1089
01:27:15,599 --> 01:27:18,438
It's something like well things aren't going so well for you, so

1090
01:27:18,959 --> 01:27:20,959
The first thing you might think is

1091
01:27:21,749 --> 01:27:28,219
You're not doing well. What does that mean? You're not doing good does that not mean you're not acting properly means

1092
01:27:28,219 --> 01:27:35,058
It's the hint because God is suggesting that if you were doing properly you would be

1093
01:27:36,059 --> 01:27:38,059
successFul I

1094
01:27:38,070 --> 01:27:43,669
had a friend at one point who was a very bitter person, and he had a bunch of problems and

1095
01:27:44,429 --> 01:27:48,319
some of them were self-inflicted and some of them were fate I suppose and

1096
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:54,889
He had he had become very very destructive Murderously destructive genocide, ly destructive

1097
01:27:54,889 --> 01:27:56,899
I would say you could see it in his dreams and and

1098
01:27:57,449 --> 01:27:59,449
he lived with me for a while and

1099
01:28:00,090 --> 01:28:01,949
I

1100
01:28:01,949 --> 01:28:06,109
Knew him very well he was a friend of mine from the time. I was 12 until the time he committed suicide

1101
01:28:06,590 --> 01:28:08,590
he was spoke 40 and

1102
01:28:10,080 --> 01:28:12,830
When he lived with me, I was trying to help him get on his feet

1103
01:28:12,830 --> 01:28:17,749
which was why he had come to live with me because he thought maybe I could help him you know on his feet and

1104
01:28:18,030 --> 01:28:19,980
He could only take

1105
01:28:19,980 --> 01:28:26,299
Relatively low level jobs. You know like he had some mechanical ability didn't he didn't get educated although. He's a very very smart person

1106
01:28:26,300 --> 01:28:29,210
He probably had an Iq about 135 or something like that

1107
01:28:29,210 --> 01:28:33,799
He's very smart and so he was bitter too because he hadn't educated himself to the level that his

1108
01:28:34,139 --> 01:28:37,609
Education select would have demanded so he had to take jobs that were beneath him

1109
01:28:37,800 --> 01:28:40,940
Intellectually and he had a really had that real intellectual arrogance

1110
01:28:40,940 --> 01:28:45,980
You know because he was smart and really smart people often come to believe that

1111
01:28:46,349 --> 01:28:51,799
Only Smart Matters and if they're smart and all that and all that matters is smart

1112
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:58,580
And then the world is sort of laying itself at their feet then they've been terribly betrayed and and then they cling to their

1113
01:28:59,369 --> 01:29:04,879
Intelligence which is more like a talent or a gift like it's a like. It's an idol. You know a False idol

1114
01:29:04,880 --> 01:29:07,460
which is exactly what it is in a very dangerous one and

1115
01:29:07,830 --> 01:29:15,619
Get cynical about the stupidity of the world and the fact that their talents weren't properly recognized, and that's just not that helpful

1116
01:29:15,619 --> 01:29:20,719
You know because smart is a good thing, but I'll tell you if you don't use it properly it will devour. You just like all

1117
01:29:21,420 --> 01:29:23,629
arbitrarily assigned Talent, right

1118
01:29:23,630 --> 01:29:26,060
So you might have a talent but it's your friend

1119
01:29:26,060 --> 01:29:30,379
If you use it properly, and if you excuse it it will be your enemy

1120
01:29:30,380 --> 01:29:36,679
And maybe that's how God keeps the cosmic scales adjusted, but anyhow my friend was a very smart person although

1121
01:29:36,900 --> 01:29:41,299
Not as smart as he thought he was unfortunately and and but he hadn't done

1122
01:29:41,300 --> 01:29:45,380
What would have been necessary with that intelligence to make it manifest itself?

1123
01:29:45,630 --> 01:29:49,429
Properly in the world and that also embittered him because he also knew that

1124
01:29:50,369 --> 01:29:55,819
There was more that he could have done if he would have done it and perhaps more that he could still do what I was

1125
01:29:55,820 --> 01:30:00,080
Suggesting to him while he was living with us because he was you know

1126
01:30:00,840 --> 01:30:03,290
two levels from Homeless by that point

1127
01:30:03,630 --> 01:30:06,259
Was that he should find a job that he could find?

1128
01:30:06,449 --> 01:30:12,618
Working in a in a garage working in a shop something like that cuz he had some mechanical ability and that he should

1129
01:30:13,710 --> 01:30:21,229
Do he should separate himself from the arrogance that made him presume that such a job would beneath him?

1130
01:30:21,780 --> 01:30:29,269
Because at that point no job was beneath him and but more importantly it's not so obvious that jobs are beneath people

1131
01:30:29,849 --> 01:30:34,609
you know because even if you're a even if the imagine you have a job as a

1132
01:30:35,309 --> 01:30:36,389
checkout

1133
01:30:36,389 --> 01:30:40,938
Person in a in a grocery store, you know it's a fairly unskilled job

1134
01:30:41,010 --> 01:30:45,769
You can be in some miserable resentful horrid bastard doing that job boy

1135
01:30:45,809 --> 01:30:50,958
you know you can come in there just exuding resentment bitterness and making fakes and

1136
01:30:51,389 --> 01:30:58,549
Making sure that every customer that passes by you has a slightly worse day than they need to right and and you know

1137
01:30:58,949 --> 01:31:04,038
Pilfering time and Perhaps pilfering goods and being resentful about the people who?

1138
01:31:04,380 --> 01:31:10,309
Who gave you the position because they're above you in the dominance hierarchy and talking you know bad things

1139
01:31:11,010 --> 01:31:15,530
Gossiping behind the back of your co-workers. It's like you can take your menial position

1140
01:31:17,130 --> 01:31:20,599
Self-described and turn that into a very nice little slice of hell

1141
01:31:20,699 --> 01:31:23,449
That's for sure, and you know you go into places like that

1142
01:31:23,449 --> 01:31:27,589
I always think of the archetypal diner in that way you know you guys have been in this diner

1143
01:31:27,749 --> 01:31:33,589
There's a really good opposite diner, and there's a great video on YouTube

1144
01:31:33,590 --> 01:31:36,349
it's Tom waits reading reading a poem by

1145
01:31:37,050 --> 01:31:39,320
Bukowski, and I think it's called Nirvana

1146
01:31:39,320 --> 01:31:45,889
and it's about a good diner that he happened to visit Bukowski happened to visit when he was on a bus when he was a

1147
01:31:46,079 --> 01:31:50,748
When he was a kid a diner where everything was going well, and you could listen to that. It's great

1148
01:31:50,749 --> 01:31:55,219
I think it's great, but this is the opposite diner. I'm thinking wow so you go into a diner, right?

1149
01:31:55,229 --> 01:31:57,139
It's seven o'clock in the morning

1150
01:31:57,139 --> 01:32:03,199
And you order some bacon and eggs and some toast and then you look around in the diner and you think

1151
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:05,550
It was like

1152
01:32:05,550 --> 01:32:11,809
1975 when the windows were last washed and there's this kind of thick coating of who gives a damn grease on the on

1153
01:32:11,909 --> 01:32:18,469
The Walls you know and and the floor too has got that sort of stickiness that you really have to work out to develop over

1154
01:32:18,469 --> 01:32:20,469
Years you know and the waitress is

1155
01:32:20,519 --> 01:32:26,539
she's not happy to be there and the guy behind the counter isn't happy that that happens to be the waitress that he's working with

1156
01:32:26,539 --> 01:32:32,089
And then you know you walk down the stairs. Maybe to the washroom, and that's its own little trip

1157
01:32:32,850 --> 01:32:36,090
So you come back and you order your damn eggs?

1158
01:32:36,090 --> 01:32:38,759
And you order your toast in the order your bacon

1159
01:32:38,760 --> 01:32:44,099
And then it comes and like the eggs are too cooked on the bottom

1160
01:32:44,100 --> 01:32:49,079
So they're kind of brown, and then they're kind of raw on top and and they're cold in the middle

1161
01:32:49,080 --> 01:32:52,140
Which is you really have to work the cooking egg like that man

1162
01:32:52,140 --> 01:32:57,359
But you can master that with like ten years of bitterness you teach how to cook an egg like that

1163
01:32:57,520 --> 01:33:01,050
and then the toast here's what you do with the toast right you put

1164
01:33:01,390 --> 01:33:04,559
You take you take the white bread you know the pre sliced

1165
01:33:04,750 --> 01:33:08,520
Stuff that no one should ever eat then you put that in the toaster

1166
01:33:08,520 --> 01:33:11,520
And you overcook it and then you wait

1167
01:33:11,520 --> 01:33:15,720
and then you pop it out of the toaster and then because it's overcooked you scrape it off and

1168
01:33:16,510 --> 01:33:17,790
You knock off the crumb

1169
01:33:17,790 --> 01:33:18,930
So it doesn't look too burnt

1170
01:33:18,930 --> 01:33:21,629
and then you wait till it's cold and then you put

1171
01:33:21,940 --> 01:33:25,680
Cold Margarine on it because if you put cold first of all not butter

1172
01:33:25,720 --> 01:33:30,359
but if you put cold margarine or you can also kind of tear holes in it so that then it has

1173
01:33:30,730 --> 01:33:37,530
Lumps of margarine in it and it's really dry except where it's too greasy so that's like your own little work of art man

1174
01:33:37,540 --> 01:33:41,640
And then you put that on the side with the with. The--

1175
01:33:42,280 --> 01:33:46,769
With the eggs, and then you have the potatoes, and this is how you cook the potatoes properly

1176
01:33:48,970 --> 01:33:51,599
you know so they're leftover potatoes and

1177
01:33:51,910 --> 01:33:56,700
You keep dumping new Leftover potatoes into the old leftover potatoes over weeks

1178
01:33:56,700 --> 01:34:02,909
And so some of the potatoes have they're no longer potatoes right they've have returned to mother Earth

1179
01:34:03,490 --> 01:34:05,490
Huh?

1180
01:34:05,770 --> 01:34:08,879
then you flop them on the grill and you sort of

1181
01:34:09,580 --> 01:34:16,499
Hide it. Oh you burn them a bit. I guess and then you've slapped them on the plate and jesus you don't eat those man

1182
01:34:17,800 --> 01:34:20,129
That's for sure, and that's the point and then

1183
01:34:20,860 --> 01:34:26,790
You have the bacon and you want to make sure you buy the lowest possible quality bacon, not such

1184
01:34:27,130 --> 01:34:30,240
Let's how you start and then you throw it on the grill

1185
01:34:30,240 --> 01:34:32,490
And you don't your grill has to be?

1186
01:34:32,740 --> 01:34:39,809
Overheated to do this you have to cook the bacon so that it's raw in places and burnt in other places and it has that

1187
01:34:40,150 --> 01:34:48,090
Delightful picked like odor that only really cheap badly cooked bacon can provide or may we use those little breakfast sausages that

1188
01:34:48,280 --> 01:34:53,610
no one in their bloody right mind would let within 15 feet of anything living you know and

1189
01:34:53,800 --> 01:34:59,969
Then you serve that right, and you serve it with the kind of orange juice that is only orange in color

1190
01:35:03,610 --> 01:35:06,150
and then with coffee, that's ah

1191
01:35:08,050 --> 01:35:12,389
What would you say? It was started too early in the morning. That's the first thing

1192
01:35:13,150 --> 01:35:16,049
Bad quality coffee started too early in the morning

1193
01:35:16,930 --> 01:35:22,139
got cold once or twice and has been reheated and then you serve that with

1194
01:35:23,410 --> 01:35:25,410
Whitener

1195
01:35:25,660 --> 01:35:32,010
Like here's your breakfast. It's like no, man. That's not breakfast. That's hell

1196
01:35:38,410 --> 01:35:40,410
no, and

1197
01:35:40,540 --> 01:35:42,540
And you created it

1198
01:35:42,540 --> 01:35:42,880
and

1199
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:48,239
Then what you do if you have a diner like that is because you have a miserable life if you have a diner like that

1200
01:35:48,240 --> 01:35:52,889
And you've really worked on achieving that is every night you go home and you curse your wife

1201
01:35:52,890 --> 01:35:54,150
And you curse your kids

1202
01:35:54,150 --> 01:36:00,839
And you fucking well cursed God too for producing a universe where a diner like yours is allowed to exist

1203
01:36:01,060 --> 01:36:03,060
And that's your bloody life

1204
01:36:03,670 --> 01:36:05,670
so

1205
01:36:05,770 --> 01:36:08,430
Also, that's what God is trying to point out here is

1206
01:36:18,699 --> 01:36:21,658
If thou doest well shalt thou not be accepted

1207
01:36:22,810 --> 01:36:24,190
and

1208
01:36:24,190 --> 01:36:31,589
If thou doest not well then sin lies at your door well, so what I looked at lots of translations for this and actually

1209
01:36:32,230 --> 01:36:35,549
The next line is and unto these unto thee shall be his desire

1210
01:36:36,369 --> 01:36:38,369
Yes

1211
01:36:38,590 --> 01:36:41,310
What God actually says is something like this is like

1212
01:36:42,489 --> 01:36:44,400
You know things aren't going so well for you

1213
01:36:44,400 --> 01:36:49,770
But if you were behaving properly they would but instead this is what you've done sin came to your door and sin means to you

1214
01:36:49,770 --> 01:36:52,589
Know pull your arrow back and to miss the Target sin came to your door

1215
01:36:52,690 --> 01:36:57,270
But he uses a metaphor and the metaphor is something like sin came to your door like this

1216
01:36:57,820 --> 01:36:59,530
sexually aroused

1217
01:36:59,530 --> 01:37:01,530
cat Predator thing and

1218
01:37:03,100 --> 01:37:10,649
You invited it in first, and then you let it have its way with you. It's like you entered into a creative

1219
01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:16,710
uses of sexual metaphor he entered into a creative exchange with it and

1220
01:37:17,050 --> 01:37:23,070
gave birth to something as a consequence and that what you gave birth to you that that's your life and and

1221
01:37:24,250 --> 01:37:29,369
You knew it you're self conscious after all you knew you were doing this and you?

1222
01:37:32,290 --> 01:37:34,290
conspired with

1223
01:37:34,300 --> 01:37:35,860
this thing

1224
01:37:35,860 --> 01:37:37,860
To produce the situation that you're in

1225
01:37:38,350 --> 01:37:40,350
Young said something about this

1226
01:37:40,690 --> 01:37:43,350
similar about the Eatable mother situation

1227
01:37:43,780 --> 01:37:48,509
Sorry, it was very politically incorrect what he said of course every single thing

1228
01:37:48,510 --> 01:37:53,520
He wrote was politically incorrect so just how you could tell he was a thinker by the way

1229
01:37:56,679 --> 01:38:03,779
He talked about the unholy alliance between hyper dependent children and their mothers and he said well

1230
01:38:03,780 --> 01:38:07,170
It's actually because you probably thought about it as a as a maternal thing

1231
01:38:07,380 --> 01:38:11,580
I'm not putting freud down because freud mapped out the oedipal situation brilliantly

1232
01:38:11,889 --> 01:38:17,249
I'm not putting 4i down, but you know jung was taking the ideas and expanding them Outward

1233
01:38:17,250 --> 01:38:23,219
and you know he said that there was an actually an unholy alliance between a hyper dependent child and a

1234
01:38:23,760 --> 01:38:28,140
And they need to pull over dependent mother and the alliance was the mother would always offer

1235
01:38:29,380 --> 01:38:34,080
so maybe the kid is supposed to go off and do something that would require a little bit of courage and effort and

1236
01:38:37,540 --> 01:38:45,390
The mother says well are you sure you're feeling well enough to do it and then the child could say

1237
01:38:46,960 --> 01:38:48,130
Yes

1238
01:38:48,130 --> 01:38:52,500
Or the child could say no, and then you know be put in bed

1239
01:38:52,500 --> 01:38:55,859
And maybe didn't all of that and but the thing is the child

1240
01:38:56,410 --> 01:39:03,389
Made the damn decision too, and you might think well, that's pretty harsh, but just because children are little doesn't mean. They're stupid and

1241
01:39:04,510 --> 01:39:08,520
You don't know children if you don't know how children know how to manipulate

1242
01:39:09,040 --> 01:39:14,100
Because they are staggeringly good at that because they're studying you non-stop trying to figure out

1243
01:39:14,770 --> 01:39:21,479
what you're up to and be how they can get what they want in the way that they wanted and so they can play a

1244
01:39:21,790 --> 01:39:25,950
Manipulative game no problem especially if they're well schooled in it, and so it's sort of like that. It's like

1245
01:39:26,200 --> 01:39:31,409
Maybe the mother is a little too a little timid and a little inclined to overprotect and maybe the child is a little

1246
01:39:32,500 --> 01:39:38,100
manipulative and a little willing to not take that courageous step out in the world and to

1247
01:39:38,410 --> 01:39:40,709
regress into infantile dependency

1248
01:39:41,470 --> 01:39:46,829
Instead and then you get a terrible dynamic building across time that is like a vicious circle

1249
01:39:46,830 --> 01:39:52,169
you know or like a positive feedback loop that just expands and expands and expands because sometimes in families you see a

1250
01:39:52,450 --> 01:39:58,529
Hyper dependent child and a perfectly independent child in same mother so obviously

1251
01:39:59,140 --> 01:40:03,839
Same there. I mean mother's very complex and mother for child a and mother for Child B

1252
01:40:03,840 --> 01:40:08,190
Are not the same mother even if they happen to be the same human being that literature is quite clear on that

1253
01:40:08,200 --> 01:40:10,799
But you get my point, but god's idea was

1254
01:40:13,060 --> 01:40:15,479
not only are you not doing well because

1255
01:40:17,230 --> 01:40:18,270
You're not doing well

1256
01:40:18,270 --> 01:40:23,399
But you're not doing well because you've actually really spent a lot of work figuring out how to not do well

1257
01:40:23,400 --> 01:40:27,359
this is like creative effort on your part and if you read about

1258
01:40:28,210 --> 01:40:34,350
Truly malevolent people and you could start with the Columbine killers because they left some very interesting diaries behind

1259
01:40:34,350 --> 01:40:39,390
So I would recommend them if you there plenty of serial killers you could read about in the people

1260
01:40:39,390 --> 01:40:41,130
Who've really gone out and done dark things

1261
01:40:41,130 --> 01:40:44,970
And I've read more than my fair share of that sort of thing and understand it quite well

1262
01:40:46,780 --> 01:40:51,719
If you really want to have your countenance fall and be roth

1263
01:40:52,630 --> 01:40:54,630
Ten years of brooding on

1264
01:40:55,090 --> 01:40:57,090
your own catastrophe

1265
01:40:57,100 --> 01:40:59,020
Sort of a loan and

1266
01:40:59,020 --> 01:41:01,229
Letting your fantasies. Take shape and

1267
01:41:01,780 --> 01:41:04,589
endi and egging them on and and

1268
01:41:05,290 --> 01:41:12,089
Allowing them to flourish and let's say take possession of you because that's exactly the right way to think of it. That will get you

1269
01:41:13,060 --> 01:41:20,789
Somewhere like this and there are more people who are like that than you think and you're more like that than you think

1270
01:41:25,180 --> 01:41:29,399
Well so kayne he's obviously not very happy about this whole answer obviously

1271
01:41:29,740 --> 01:41:34,229
Because the last thing you want to hear if your life is turned into a catastrophe and you

1272
01:41:34,360 --> 01:41:39,420
Take God to task for creating a universe where that sort of thing was allowed is that?

1273
01:41:39,580 --> 01:41:40,900
It's your own damn fault

1274
01:41:40,900 --> 01:41:47,070
And you should straighten up and fly right so to speak and you shouldn't be complaining about the nature of being

1275
01:41:48,520 --> 01:41:51,600
But that is the answer he gets and so then what happens

1276
01:41:52,210 --> 01:41:58,890
well we have to infer that if kane was angry before that he's a lot more angry now and

1277
01:41:59,530 --> 01:42:01,530
Of course that's exactly

1278
01:42:02,170 --> 01:42:05,310
what the story reveals and cain talked with abel his brother and

1279
01:42:07,210 --> 01:42:12,030
It came to pass when they were in the field that cain rose up against abel his brother and slew him

1280
01:42:15,970 --> 01:42:17,970
I'm going to read you something else now

1281
01:42:18,760 --> 01:42:20,760
This is foreshadowing again

1282
01:42:21,160 --> 01:42:23,160
This is from the same chapter by the way

1283
01:42:23,650 --> 01:42:25,650
Do what is Meaningful not what is expedient?

1284
01:42:25,900 --> 01:42:32,609
Jesus was Led into the wilderness according to the story to be tempted by the devil Matthew 4:1 prior to his crucifixion

1285
01:42:32,830 --> 01:42:34,830
This is the story of cain

1286
01:42:35,170 --> 01:42:42,089
Restated abstractly cain is far from happy as we have seen he's working hard or so he thinks but God is not pleased

1287
01:42:42,610 --> 01:42:49,140
Meanwhile Abel is dancing away in the daisies his crops flourish women love him first of all. He's a pretty good guy

1288
01:42:50,020 --> 01:42:54,569
Everyone oh is it he deserves his good fortune all the more reason to hate him

1289
01:42:54,610 --> 01:43:00,810
I used to joke when I used to teach at Harvard and now and then my wife would have some of the undergraduates over

1290
01:43:00,880 --> 01:43:06,569
We used to joke afterwards because some of them were many of them were very remarkable kids. You know like they

1291
01:43:07,360 --> 01:43:13,890
They were super smart they were athletic or they had some dramatic ability or they were musicians, or they done some spectacular

1292
01:43:14,500 --> 01:43:16,649
Charitable work because he basically to get

1293
01:43:16,719 --> 01:43:19,619
Accepted into harvard you had to be top of your damn school

1294
01:43:19,620 --> 01:43:23,519
And then you had to have at least two other outstanding things going for you

1295
01:43:23,520 --> 01:43:26,249
You know and what was so annoying about most of these kids

1296
01:43:26,250 --> 01:43:30,390
This was our joke with you really both liked them and respected them

1297
01:43:30,390 --> 01:43:35,189
It's like we my joke was do you think they would have had the good graces to be like?

1298
01:43:35,679 --> 01:43:41,759
Dislikeable sons of bitches at least with all the all those other great things going for them. They had to act like

1299
01:43:42,460 --> 01:43:47,939
Respectability and like ability to it as well, so you thought well, you know it really couldn't happen to a better person

1300
01:43:47,940 --> 01:43:54,509
It's like good. God well, that's that's that's able situation. You know it's like and you know the funny thing, too

1301
01:43:54,510 --> 01:43:59,310
Is that that's an ideal? That's the ideal right because an ideal person let's say would be

1302
01:44:00,760 --> 01:44:07,890
someone who you would want to be like and and someone who is operating in the world like you would want to operate and

1303
01:44:08,050 --> 01:44:15,239
Someone whom fortune was smiling on and someone who is making the right sacrifices. It's really what you would want to be and

1304
01:44:16,060 --> 01:44:18,060
So can kill that?

1305
01:44:19,570 --> 01:44:25,529
Right so it's a psychological story too, and you see this in the cynicism that people have about

1306
01:44:26,110 --> 01:44:31,770
People who have done well in the world. They're always looking for some reason. Why they've done well

1307
01:44:31,770 --> 01:44:36,959
they must be crooked or they must be they must be conniving or they must be arrogant or they must be

1308
01:44:37,330 --> 01:44:39,989
psychopathic or you know and of course all of those things exist

1309
01:44:40,030 --> 01:44:46,920
But it's a very bad trick to play on yourself to make the proposition that the person in the world who?

1310
01:44:47,380 --> 01:44:50,880
represents your own ideal is that ideal because of

1311
01:44:52,060 --> 01:44:58,709
Despicable reasons because what you do is train yourself that the ideal that you should pursue can only exist if it's motivated by

1312
01:44:58,929 --> 01:45:05,849
Despicable reasons, and then what not only is able your brother dad as your brother in the field in reality

1313
01:45:05,850 --> 01:45:08,639
But you've also slaughtered your own ideal

1314
01:45:09,340 --> 01:45:12,929
Well, then what the hell are you going to work for well? How are you gonna live then?

1315
01:45:13,750 --> 01:45:16,589
Well bitterly and miserably that's for sure

1316
01:45:16,989 --> 01:45:23,039
Bitterly miserably and hopelessly that's how you're going to live you know it's so rare that I see

1317
01:45:23,650 --> 01:45:24,760
especially

1318
01:45:24,760 --> 01:45:25,929
publicly

1319
01:45:25,929 --> 01:45:27,520
that people

1320
01:45:27,520 --> 01:45:35,219
Honestly admit with sports figures. They'll do it. That's that's one place where that seems to happen, but it's so uncommon for

1321
01:45:35,920 --> 01:45:39,299
expressions of admiration and gratitude to

1322
01:45:40,210 --> 01:45:42,659
manifest themselves in any public

1323
01:45:43,719 --> 01:45:45,989
communication of any Sort newspapers TV

1324
01:45:46,659 --> 01:45:49,709
YouTube Twitter, it's almost always

1325
01:45:51,520 --> 01:45:56,549
Undermining and backbiting and criticism and very often directed to people who?

1326
01:45:59,800 --> 01:46:01,830
Who have often done little else, but?

1327
01:46:02,619 --> 01:46:09,509
Bring good things into the world for other people, and that's part of why this is such a profound story

1328
01:46:12,010 --> 01:46:16,889
He's a pretty good guy everyone knows that he deserves his good fortune all the more reason to hate him

1329
01:46:17,080 --> 01:46:21,959
That's for sure kane broods on his misfortune like a vulture on an egg

1330
01:46:22,330 --> 01:46:25,739
He enters the desert wilderness of his own mind. He

1331
01:46:25,960 --> 01:46:30,449
Obsesses over his ill fortune and betrayal he nourishes his resentment

1332
01:46:34,300 --> 01:46:37,139
He indulges in ever more elaborate fantasies of revenge

1333
01:46:38,080 --> 01:46:43,229
His arrogance grows to Luciferian proportions. I'm ill used and oppressed

1334
01:46:43,230 --> 01:46:47,790
He thinks this is a stupid bloody planet it can go to hell

1335
01:46:48,639 --> 01:46:54,029
And with that he encounters Satan in the wilderness and falls prey to his temptations

1336
01:46:55,150 --> 01:46:58,710
And he does what he can in John Milton's unforgettable words

1337
01:46:59,139 --> 01:47:05,879
To confound the race of mankind in the first route and mingle and involve Earth with hell

1338
01:47:06,340 --> 01:47:08,230
done all

1339
01:47:08,230 --> 01:47:10,770
despite the Great creator

1340
01:47:13,659 --> 01:47:20,799
He turns to evil to obtain what good forbade him, and he does it voluntarily self consciously and with malice.

1341
01:47:22,610 --> 01:47:24,759
Let him who has ears hear.

1342
01:47:29,270 --> 01:47:34,810
So that's the first two human beings. The resentful, bitter, failure

1343
01:47:36,110 --> 01:47:39,519
taking an axe to the admirable success

1344
01:47:45,710 --> 01:47:50,650
Then the Lord said unto cain. Where is abel thy brother, and he said I know not am I my brother's keeper

1345
01:47:53,060 --> 01:47:54,860
and

1346
01:47:54,860 --> 01:48:00,219
He said what hast thou done the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground?

1347
01:48:03,770 --> 01:48:09,880
Now art thou cursed from the Earth which hath opened her mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand

1348
01:48:11,570 --> 01:48:17,769
You know if you want to understand that which I would recommend you could read Dostoyevsky's

1349
01:48:19,790 --> 01:48:21,790
Crime and punishment

1350
01:48:21,950 --> 01:48:23,660
That's a great

1351
01:48:23,660 --> 01:48:28,300
It's a great novel. I think it might be the greatest novel ever written because I haven't read every novel

1352
01:48:28,300 --> 01:48:33,400
But in my experience, it's the greatest novel and it is exactly this it

1353
01:48:34,400 --> 01:48:38,529
It says what happens psychologically if you commit the ultimate crime

1354
01:48:39,200 --> 01:48:42,400
It's amazing. It's absolutely amazing it's it's it's

1355
01:48:43,760 --> 01:48:45,500
There's

1356
01:48:45,500 --> 01:48:47,920
There's no psychologist like dostoyevsky

1357
01:48:48,890 --> 01:48:52,450
We now tell us the ground it shall not henceforth Yield unto thee her strength

1358
01:48:52,520 --> 01:48:57,070
A fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou be in the Earth and cain said unto the Lord

1359
01:48:57,680 --> 01:49:03,369
My punishment is greater than I can bear now one of the things that's interesting about this is that you know it

1360
01:49:03,580 --> 01:49:07,269
I think the punishment that God lays on cain is

1361
01:49:08,300 --> 01:49:14,349
It's like the inevitable consequences of cain's action. It's something like that. It's like well. He killed his brother

1362
01:49:15,980 --> 01:49:18,040
There's no going back from that man like

1363
01:49:19,190 --> 01:49:21,190
good luck forgiving yourself for

1364
01:49:21,620 --> 01:49:27,970
That especially if he was an ideal, especially if he was your ideal because he haven't just killed your brother and of course

1365
01:49:29,090 --> 01:49:34,569
tortured your parents and the rest of your family you've deprived the community of someone who is upstanding and

1366
01:49:35,630 --> 01:49:39,009
You did it for the worst possible motivations. It's like

1367
01:49:40,880 --> 01:49:42,349
There's no

1368
01:49:42,349 --> 01:49:45,189
up from there right that's

1369
01:49:45,949 --> 01:49:48,489
That's as close to hell as you could manage on Earth

1370
01:49:48,489 --> 01:49:52,178
I would say and kane said unto the lord my punishment is greater than I can bear

1371
01:49:53,389 --> 01:49:58,449
Behold thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the earth and from thy face shall I be hid

1372
01:49:58,579 --> 01:50:01,058
Doubt to is like there's also no

1373
01:50:01,670 --> 01:50:06,460
Turning back to God let's say after an error like that because well

1374
01:50:07,729 --> 01:50:10,899
You've done everything you possibly could to spite

1375
01:50:11,539 --> 01:50:12,559
God

1376
01:50:12,559 --> 01:50:19,689
Assuming he exists and the probability that you're going to be able to mend that relationship in your now broken state

1377
01:50:20,479 --> 01:50:24,519
When you couldn't mend it to begin with before you did something so terrible

1378
01:50:25,460 --> 01:50:27,460
starts to move towards zero and

1379
01:50:27,800 --> 01:50:33,400
It shall come to pass that everyone that findeth me shall slay me and the Lord said unto him there for

1380
01:50:34,010 --> 01:50:37,719
whosoever Slayeth cain Vengeance Shall be taken on Him, Sevenfold

1381
01:50:38,059 --> 01:50:43,748
And the Lord said a mark upon cain lest any finding him should kill him that's an interesting thing

1382
01:50:43,749 --> 01:50:46,599
I wanted about that for a long time because you might think well

1383
01:50:46,599 --> 01:50:51,549
Why would God take cain under his wing so to speak given? What's already happened, and I think it has something to do with

1384
01:50:52,159 --> 01:50:56,949
The emergence of the idea that it was necessary to prevent tit-for-tat

1385
01:50:57,559 --> 01:51:00,579
revenge slayings, it's something like that you know and

1386
01:51:01,130 --> 01:51:04,690
And there's hints of that later in the text because you know it's like

1387
01:51:05,059 --> 01:51:08,199
Well, I kill your brother and then you kill two of my brothers

1388
01:51:08,199 --> 01:51:11,828
And then I kill your whole family and then you kill my whole town

1389
01:51:11,829 --> 01:51:16,839
And then I kill your whole country and then we blow up the world. It's like. Yeah, that's probably not a very

1390
01:51:17,539 --> 01:51:18,619
intelligent

1391
01:51:18,619 --> 01:51:20,030
solution to the Initial

1392
01:51:20,030 --> 01:51:24,729
Problem even though the initial problem which might be a murder is not an easy thing to solve

1393
01:51:24,889 --> 01:51:29,379
But I think it's something like that and then the last part of the story is

1394
01:51:30,499 --> 01:51:32,499
God's William Blake

1395
01:51:35,269 --> 01:51:39,449
so Adam and eve have discovered their dead son, and

1396
01:51:40,840 --> 01:51:42,369
cain

1397
01:51:42,369 --> 01:51:46,978
Has become cognizant. I would say of what he did and what he is

1398
01:51:47,619 --> 01:51:51,748
right so it's another entrance into a form of self-consciousness, it's it's

1399
01:51:52,510 --> 01:51:56,550
You know the self-consciousness that Adam and Eve developed was painful enough

1400
01:51:56,860 --> 01:52:03,989
They become aware of their own vulnerability in their nakedness and perhaps even their capacity for evil, but cain becomes aware of his

1401
01:52:07,239 --> 01:52:09,958
Voluntary engagement with Evil itself and

1402
01:52:10,989 --> 01:52:13,078
sees that as a crucial

1403
01:52:14,169 --> 01:52:16,169
Human capability

1404
01:52:16,809 --> 01:52:22,619
And that's something modern people. You know it's no wonder we don't take it seriously like I know in the academy and

1405
01:52:23,409 --> 01:52:27,748
Among intellectual circles for decades the idea of Evil has been it's like

1406
01:52:28,389 --> 01:52:30,159
What are you?

1407
01:52:30,159 --> 01:52:35,609
Medieval or something you know the whole idea of evil you don't that's a non-starter as an intellectual

1408
01:52:36,639 --> 01:52:44,248
Starting place as a as a topic and that's something that I've just been unable to understand because I cannot understand how you could possibly

1409
01:52:46,059 --> 01:52:50,369
Have more than a cursory knowledge of the history of the 20th century

1410
01:52:51,579 --> 01:52:55,049
much much less a deep knowledge of the history of the 20th century and

1411
01:52:55,689 --> 01:53:02,879
To walk away with any other conclusion, then well good might not exist but evil hey

1412
01:53:04,599 --> 01:53:06,599
the Evidence for that is

1413
01:53:07,689 --> 01:53:09,689
So overwhelming that

1414
01:53:12,400 --> 01:53:18,239
That only willful blindness could possibly explain denying in its existence

1415
01:53:21,070 --> 01:53:22,329
and

1416
01:53:22,329 --> 01:53:24,839
That was actually a useful discovery for me

1417
01:53:25,479 --> 01:53:27,459
because I also

1418
01:53:27,459 --> 01:53:28,659
concluded

1419
01:53:28,659 --> 01:53:33,299
Perhaps that if it was true evil existed then it

1420
01:53:33,909 --> 01:53:36,868
It was true by inference that its opposite existed

1421
01:53:37,689 --> 01:53:43,499
Because the opposite of evil. Let's say the evil of the concentration camp. Let's say or we could get more specific about it

1422
01:53:43,499 --> 01:53:46,469
We could say there's this one thing that used to happen in our Switz

1423
01:53:47,050 --> 01:53:49,050
where they would take

1424
01:53:49,429 --> 01:53:56,109
People off the incoming trains those who lived you know that weren't stacked around the outside of the train

1425
01:53:57,679 --> 01:53:59,599
Train

1426
01:53:59,599 --> 01:54:03,129
Cars and you know froze to death because it was too cold

1427
01:54:03,130 --> 01:54:05,979
You know those who only had to be stuck in the middle where it was warm enough

1428
01:54:05,979 --> 01:54:09,579
So that maybe the old people died because they suffocated

1429
01:54:09,579 --> 01:54:13,119
But at least some of them were alive when they made it to our sweats

1430
01:54:13,119 --> 01:54:18,038
and then they took those poor people out one of the tricks that the guards used to play on them was to have the

1431
01:54:18,769 --> 01:54:20,769
the Newly arrived prisoners

1432
01:54:21,079 --> 01:54:26,799
Hoist like hundred pound sacks of wet salt and carried them from one side of the compound

1433
01:54:27,050 --> 01:54:31,090
And these compounds were big this was a city. It wasn't like a gymnasium

1434
01:54:31,090 --> 01:54:33,880
It was like a city there were tens of thousands of people there

1435
01:54:34,059 --> 01:54:38,228
they'd have them carry the sack of wet salt from one side of the compound to the other and

1436
01:54:38,929 --> 01:54:40,929
then back

1437
01:54:40,969 --> 01:54:44,078
right and that was to make a mockery out of the

1438
01:54:44,989 --> 01:54:50,948
Notion that work would set you free. It's like no. No you work here, but there's nothing productive about it

1439
01:54:51,469 --> 01:54:57,728
The whole point it's exactly the opposite of sacrifice in some sense, it's oh, we're going to make you act out working

1440
01:54:57,729 --> 01:55:00,219
But all it will do is speed your demise

1441
01:55:00,219 --> 01:55:05,018
and maybe we can decorate it up a little bit because not only will it speed up your demise it will do it in a

1442
01:55:05,019 --> 01:55:07,599
Very painful way while simultaneously increasing

1443
01:55:07,999 --> 01:55:14,589
The probability that other people's demises will be painful and sped up. It's a work of arts. That's for sure and

1444
01:55:16,579 --> 01:55:20,919
To to know about that sort of thing and not to not regard it as evil means

1445
01:55:21,320 --> 01:55:23,650
Well, you can figure out what it means for yourself

1446
01:55:24,380 --> 01:55:25,699
and

1447
01:55:25,699 --> 01:55:29,828
Cain went out from the presence of the Lord and dwelt in the land of Nod on the east of Eden

1448
01:55:30,769 --> 01:55:32,360
and

1449
01:55:32,360 --> 01:55:37,960
cain knew his wife and she conceived you know and one of the critics the criticisms are fairly common criticism of

1450
01:55:39,320 --> 01:55:42,639
These biblical stories is well if cain and Abel were the only two

1451
01:55:43,760 --> 01:55:49,090
People and from Adam and eve. It's like where did all these other people come from and doesn't that make the story?

1452
01:55:50,329 --> 01:55:54,248
Like simple-Minded it's like no that makes the reader simple-Minded

1453
01:55:54,889 --> 01:56:00,149
You know I mean really that's the best criticism of this you're going to come up with I mean absolutely

1454
01:56:02,250 --> 01:56:05,819
missed the point that that would be the right response you missed the point and

1455
01:56:06,280 --> 01:56:08,910
Cain knew his wife and she conceived and bare enoch

1456
01:56:08,910 --> 01:56:15,809
And he builded the city and so it's cain that builds the cities and starts the civilization and called that's pretty rough too, right?

1457
01:56:15,810 --> 01:56:21,390
so it's the first fratricidal murderer who builds the cities after the name of his son enoch and

1458
01:56:21,610 --> 01:56:23,970
unto enoch was born around ETc Etc

1459
01:56:25,210 --> 01:56:31,200
Going through the generations and lamech took unto him two wives the name of the one without on the name of the other zillah

1460
01:56:31,540 --> 01:56:32,830
this is a an

1461
01:56:32,830 --> 01:56:39,600
attempt to Flesh out the genealogy and to describe how culture started in some sense in these tribal communities and

1462
01:56:39,880 --> 01:56:45,600
Ada bear jebel and he was the father of such as dwell in tents and of such as have cattle and

1463
01:56:46,690 --> 01:56:48,390
His brother's name was jubal

1464
01:56:48,390 --> 01:56:54,089
and he was the father of all such handle the harp and organ and zilla she also bear tubal-cain an

1465
01:56:54,250 --> 01:56:56,970
instructor of error every artificer in brass and Iron

1466
01:56:57,910 --> 01:56:59,910
Tubal-cain

1467
01:57:00,130 --> 01:57:07,980
traditionally is the first person who makes weapons of war and lamech back to Lamech a

1468
01:57:09,400 --> 01:57:11,400
Descendant of cain

1469
01:57:11,410 --> 01:57:14,669
Said unto his wives adah and Zillah hear my voice

1470
01:57:14,670 --> 01:57:20,490
he wise of lamech Hearken unto my speech for I have slain a man to my wounding and a young man to my hurt if

1471
01:57:20,650 --> 01:57:25,200
Cain be avenged Sevenfold Truly Lamech seventy and Sevenfold

1472
01:57:29,290 --> 01:57:31,290
Well what I see, and that is this

1473
01:57:32,500 --> 01:57:34,500
proclivity of this

1474
01:57:34,720 --> 01:57:41,369
murderous capacity of cain as it manifests itself as society develops to

1475
01:57:42,310 --> 01:57:47,220
To a murderous intent that transcends the mirror killing of a brother

1476
01:57:48,130 --> 01:57:54,029
You hurt me I hurt you back. No. You heard me. I kill you in six other people and

1477
01:57:54,970 --> 01:57:58,829
The thing that happens after that is to not make it seven people

1478
01:57:58,830 --> 01:58:02,519
But to make it seventy people, and so there's this idea that once that

1479
01:58:03,100 --> 01:58:04,960
that first

1480
01:58:04,960 --> 01:58:06,070
Murderous

1481
01:58:06,070 --> 01:58:07,810
Seed is sown

1482
01:58:07,810 --> 01:58:09,930
It has this proclivity to

1483
01:58:10,840 --> 01:58:16,650
Manifest itself exponentially and that's a warning and that's also why I think Tubal cain

1484
01:58:17,080 --> 01:58:20,970
Who's one of cain's descendants was the first person who made?

1485
01:58:21,610 --> 01:58:23,610
weapons of War

1486
01:58:29,320 --> 01:58:33,779
And that's pretty much the story of cain and Abel and it's a hell of a story

1487
01:58:34,330 --> 01:58:39,899
as far as I can tell and I think it's worth thinking about pretty much forever because

1488
01:58:41,770 --> 01:58:49,020
there's so many so many it has so many facets you know and I think the

1489
01:58:49,960 --> 01:58:51,960
most

1490
01:58:52,540 --> 01:58:55,319
usefully revealing of those facets is the

1491
01:58:56,710 --> 01:59:02,040
The potential for the story once understood to shed light on not

1492
01:59:03,670 --> 01:59:05,819
your own failure not even on your

1493
01:59:06,760 --> 01:59:08,760
rejection by being let's say

1494
01:59:09,700 --> 01:59:11,939
but by the but on the

1495
01:59:13,660 --> 01:59:15,190
proclivity to

1496
01:59:15,190 --> 01:59:16,840
murder

1497
01:59:16,840 --> 01:59:19,500
the best and the best in you

1498
01:59:20,440 --> 01:59:22,680
for revenge upon that

1499
01:59:24,700 --> 01:59:26,590
violation

1500
01:59:26,590 --> 01:59:27,850
because

1501
01:59:27,850 --> 01:59:34,620
What that means and we know that knowledge of good and evil into the world so to speak with Adam and eve's transgression is

1502
01:59:35,200 --> 01:59:38,069
That now not only does humanity have to contend with

1503
01:59:39,460 --> 01:59:43,200
Tragedy and suffering and even the

1504
01:59:45,610 --> 01:59:53,490
unharvested fruits of Proper Sacrifice, But with the introduction of real Malevolence into the world, so

1505
01:59:56,500 --> 01:59:58,500
There's the fall

1506
01:59:59,140 --> 02:00:01,859
into history, and then there's the discovery of

1507
02:00:02,440 --> 02:00:06,960
Sacrifice as a medication for the fall and then there's a counter position

1508
02:00:06,960 --> 02:00:12,540
which is the emergence of malevolence as the enemy of proper Sacrifice and

1509
02:00:13,660 --> 02:00:15,660
that's where we're left at the end of

1510
02:00:16,480 --> 02:00:18,480
cain and Abel and

1511
02:00:19,060 --> 02:00:21,600
That's the end of that lecture. Thank

1512
02:00:26,860 --> 02:00:28,120
Alright

1513
02:00:28,120 --> 02:00:32,880
ok so you said that one of your moral axioms is that pain is bad and

1514
02:00:33,610 --> 02:00:36,150
So we should work to eliminate unnecessary suffering

1515
02:00:37,630 --> 02:00:45,059
Isn't this the basis for a secular morality like utilitarianism and can we therefore be Moral without religion?

1516
02:00:51,490 --> 02:00:56,729
Well, I don't think that its first of all probably

1517
02:00:58,120 --> 02:01:02,340
To the first question, but that's also

1518
02:01:04,090 --> 02:01:05,440
that

1519
02:01:05,440 --> 02:01:09,540
Derivation is predicated on the idea that that's the only idea

1520
02:01:10,180 --> 02:01:16,050
You know that I'm putting forward as a ethical idea, and it's not if that was the only idea well

1521
02:01:16,050 --> 02:01:23,459
Then you could derive from that a fairly straightforward brand of utility utilitarianism, but that also I think to

1522
02:01:27,280 --> 02:01:29,280
Push the argument in that direction also

1523
02:01:30,760 --> 02:01:38,010
Necessitates the reduction of what might constitute pain to something to uni-dimensional

1524
02:01:39,520 --> 02:01:45,450
Because I think suffering is better term than pain although pain in some sense is at the core of suffering

1525
02:01:46,540 --> 02:01:48,540
Suffering is a multi-dimensional

1526
02:01:48,700 --> 02:01:52,740
phenomena, and I don't think that you can draw a

1527
02:01:53,470 --> 02:01:56,550
simple utilitarian argument from

1528
02:01:57,820 --> 02:01:59,820
that

1529
02:02:00,460 --> 02:02:04,530
either the existence of suffering or the observation that it's

1530
02:02:05,320 --> 02:02:08,699
The reduction of unnecessary suffering might be a good thing

1531
02:02:10,270 --> 02:02:14,910
So I'm also leery of those

1532
02:02:16,360 --> 02:02:21,360
see it's not reasonable in some sense to reduce a

1533
02:02:22,720 --> 02:02:25,229
complex set of ideas to a single proposition

1534
02:02:25,330 --> 02:02:30,300
And then say the ideas that I've been putting forward and then to reduce another complex philosophical

1535
02:02:30,580 --> 02:02:38,400
Set of ideas to a single proposition, and then say aren't those two things the same and they are to reduce them to the two

1536
02:02:39,460 --> 02:02:42,480
simple axioms or you could argue that they're the same but

1537
02:02:43,090 --> 02:02:45,360
but you but I would say there's a

1538
02:02:45,490 --> 02:02:50,670
Tremendous amount left out in the telling and that what's left out is relevant it kind of reminds me of those

1539
02:02:51,250 --> 02:02:56,610
Those philosophical games that pSychologists often play. It's like well, if there was I?

1540
02:02:57,430 --> 02:02:59,610
Think when I what's the one, I don't know if I can

1541
02:03:00,250 --> 02:03:02,250
recall this properly

1542
02:03:02,980 --> 02:03:04,980
It's the trolley cart problem

1543
02:03:05,830 --> 02:03:07,480
something like

1544
02:03:07,480 --> 02:03:11,669
You know if there was a train that was out of control and it was

1545
02:03:12,400 --> 02:03:14,400
going towards

1546
02:03:14,410 --> 02:03:20,039
Six people on one track when you flip a switch, so it's switched tracks and only killed one person

1547
02:03:20,890 --> 02:03:23,939
Would you do that and I read a question like that. I think

1548
02:03:24,700 --> 02:03:28,679
that's a stupid question and the reason I think that is because

1549
02:03:29,740 --> 02:03:32,339
you can't take a situation like that and

1550
02:03:33,310 --> 02:03:34,480
Render it

1551
02:03:34,480 --> 02:03:39,390
Properly by reducing it to that question and then you also can't assume that

1552
02:03:40,030 --> 02:03:46,379
The person who answers that question would in fact act in the way they answered you can't presume any of that

1553
02:03:46,380 --> 02:03:48,750
it's like because in a situation like that in a

1554
02:03:49,540 --> 02:03:51,540
High-stress situation like that the

1555
02:03:52,000 --> 02:03:53,430
Devil is in the details

1556
02:03:53,430 --> 02:03:59,849
And I've dealt with situations like that a number of times and know perfectly well that the devils in the detail

1557
02:03:59,850 --> 02:04:01,690
so I think that there's a

1558
02:04:01,690 --> 02:04:09,270
there's an intellectual reduction to make a philosophical point that doesn't give the complexity of the topic Justice and

1559
02:04:09,880 --> 02:04:11,020
then

1560
02:04:11,020 --> 02:04:14,339
there's a second part to that which was and

1561
02:04:15,220 --> 02:04:18,990
Therefore can't we be Moral without religion. Well I

1562
02:04:19,660 --> 02:04:23,849
Would say that question also suffers in some sense from the same

1563
02:04:24,700 --> 02:04:27,450
Problem of formulation, I I'm very

1564
02:04:28,900 --> 02:04:33,300
Hesitant ever to answer a question of the form is a

1565
02:04:33,910 --> 02:04:36,059
Merely a manifestation of B

1566
02:04:36,310 --> 02:04:43,530
When a and B are very complex things because the answer that is it depends on what you mean by Moral

1567
02:04:43,530 --> 02:04:45,530
And what you mean by religious?

1568
02:04:46,210 --> 02:04:47,440
because

1569
02:04:47,440 --> 02:04:49,440
You see there's an underlying

1570
02:04:51,460 --> 02:04:53,290
intellectual

1571
02:04:53,290 --> 02:04:55,290
maneuver in in a question like that and

1572
02:04:55,750 --> 02:04:58,740
The underlying maneuver is the a priori

1573
02:04:59,080 --> 02:05:05,580
assumption that something as complex as religion or as complex as morality can be reduced to an

1574
02:05:05,890 --> 02:05:07,890
object with a name and that

1575
02:05:08,320 --> 02:05:16,169
Then two objects reduced to the name can be assessed simultaneously, and I don't think that that's the case I think

1576
02:05:16,900 --> 02:05:18,900
you can say something like

1577
02:05:19,179 --> 02:05:25,349
Is a triangle a square, I think you can say that but I don't think you can say

1578
02:05:26,679 --> 02:05:33,719
Is it possible to have morality without religion? I don't think you can have that question because it it has to be expanded out

1579
02:05:33,719 --> 02:05:39,509
So it's like what do you mean by morality exactly and what do you mean by religion because maybe and maybe not and so?

1580
02:05:40,480 --> 02:05:45,179
And so the answer to that question is to decompose the question I

1581
02:06:07,239 --> 02:06:10,619
Don't want my young children indoctrinated with dangerous ideas

1582
02:06:11,530 --> 02:06:15,540
and as time marches on I trust public education less and less I

1583
02:06:15,909 --> 02:06:21,419
Know that you have strong thoughts on the danger of the devouring oedipal mother who harms your child by protecting them

1584
02:06:22,090 --> 02:06:25,259
And that's certainly not what I aspire to I

1585
02:06:26,409 --> 02:06:32,699
Wonder if in spite of your idea that kids need to become tough and learn to slay dragons if you have anything good to say

1586
02:06:32,699 --> 02:06:34,699
about the idea of homeschooling

1587
02:06:35,440 --> 02:06:38,190
Well, I don't have anything bad to say about it

1588
02:06:38,190 --> 02:06:39,909
I do know that the

1589
02:06:39,909 --> 02:06:44,849
Quebec government has recently taken moves to make it much more difficult for people to homeschool their children

1590
02:06:44,920 --> 02:06:48,179
And it's not like five years. I mean

1591
02:06:48,880 --> 02:06:50,880
15 Years Ago I

1592
02:06:51,250 --> 02:06:56,219
Would have presumed that the vast majority of people who were homeschooling their children were

1593
02:06:57,280 --> 02:06:59,260
To be viewed with skepticism

1594
02:06:59,260 --> 02:07:01,830
Initially I'm not so sure about that anymore

1595
02:07:06,400 --> 02:07:08,819
You know for example. I was sent a poster today

1596
02:07:09,850 --> 02:07:14,999
someone sent me this link that they found in the local junior high school and one of the

1597
02:07:16,270 --> 02:07:22,020
Media pieces that were recommended on this poster was a movie called Hedwig and the angry inch

1598
02:07:22,690 --> 02:07:24,100
now I

1599
02:07:24,100 --> 02:07:31,260
Thought that was a terrible movie even though. I'm perfectly capable of enjoying bizarre movies, but so it's a bizarre movie

1600
02:07:31,260 --> 02:07:34,019
That's for sure, but I also thought it was a terrible bitter

1601
02:07:34,750 --> 02:07:39,600
Movie terrible and bitter those are separate a movie can be bitter and be quite great

1602
02:07:39,640 --> 02:07:44,189
But it was a terrible movie and it was a bitter movie, but I can tell you one bloody thing about that movie

1603
02:07:44,590 --> 02:07:48,749
It's not required viewing for twelve-Year-old kids that's for sure, so

1604
02:07:49,660 --> 02:07:55,169
I think you have increasing reason to be skeptical of the public education system. I also looked at the

1605
02:07:55,780 --> 02:07:58,169
elementary teachers federation of Ontario's

1606
02:07:59,800 --> 02:08:04,349
guidelines for education from Kindergarten to Grade 8 and what that is in

1607
02:08:05,020 --> 02:08:08,760
essence, and I think I will do a video about it in the relatively near future is a

1608
02:08:09,280 --> 02:08:13,769
blueprint for transforming children into social Justice warriors it basically says that

1609
02:08:14,290 --> 02:08:19,050
It's like you don't have to be a conspiracy theory to read that I mean we have social justice

1610
02:08:19,420 --> 02:08:25,470
tribunals in Ontario and so the idea is well if you're going to get your children if you're going to get people to

1611
02:08:26,470 --> 02:08:28,470
What would you say favor equity?

1612
02:08:29,260 --> 02:08:33,599
Properly well then you better start teaching them well. They're young it's like

1613
02:08:35,080 --> 02:08:37,080
maybe not

1614
02:08:37,720 --> 02:08:42,269
So now you you ask that question properly because you say well

1615
02:08:42,820 --> 02:08:47,939
The terrible education system the wonderful mother homeschooling right? That's the danger

1616
02:08:47,940 --> 02:08:53,070
it's like no because it might not be the wonderful mother homeschooling it might be the

1617
02:08:53,380 --> 02:08:56,640
pathological mother using the Pathology of the education system as a

1618
02:08:57,160 --> 02:09:01,200
Excuse to get her talons into her children right because that's certainly

1619
02:09:01,390 --> 02:09:06,809
Equally possible or perhaps even more possible because at least in the public education system. There's some

1620
02:09:08,020 --> 02:09:10,379
Necessity for consensus, so

1621
02:09:11,260 --> 02:09:13,260
To have something that you have to be very

1622
02:09:13,600 --> 02:09:18,329
Aware of and work to prevent right and so I would say if you're going to do that

1623
02:09:19,180 --> 02:09:21,180
Probably best not to do it on your own

1624
02:09:21,880 --> 02:09:25,350
And you need it's like you need a board of advisors or something like that

1625
02:09:25,350 --> 02:09:29,070
And so maybe it can't just be you and you have to figure out well, what what is the Aim?

1626
02:09:30,190 --> 02:09:34,830
And how are you going to manage that and what makes you think you can do it even if it's being done badly?

1627
02:09:35,260 --> 02:09:37,739
Publicly, what makes you think you could do it better

1628
02:09:37,740 --> 02:09:41,249
I mean my general advice is and people have asked me this in fact

1629
02:09:41,250 --> 02:09:43,810
I had a conversation with the guy who was Tyler my

1630
02:09:43,970 --> 02:09:49,419
Backyard this morning about something his son had said to him that he was taught at school recently

1631
02:09:49,850 --> 02:09:54,669
Which really made the Tyler who had come from a rather authoritarian country?

1632
02:09:55,040 --> 02:09:59,800
Step back on his heels and think I'm not so sure I should be sending my kid to public school anymore

1633
02:09:59,800 --> 02:10:03,579
and maybe I shouldn't be living in Toronto even you know but

1634
02:10:04,310 --> 02:10:10,720
my general advice is keep an eye on your kids and discuss with them what they're learning and and

1635
02:10:11,810 --> 02:10:14,649
help equip them with the tools to

1636
02:10:16,790 --> 02:10:18,500
not only to

1637
02:10:18,500 --> 02:10:20,500
articulate Their own Viewpoint in

1638
02:10:20,660 --> 02:10:26,139
Response to what they're being taught now if the problem is you might not have the time nor the ability to do that?

1639
02:10:26,140 --> 02:10:28,070
that's no simple thing and

1640
02:10:28,070 --> 02:10:30,070
increasingly if you're unwilling to

1641
02:10:30,680 --> 02:10:34,629
Have your children participate in what is increasingly?

1642
02:10:35,270 --> 02:10:42,550
indoctrination and not education thanks to in no small part to the Ontario institute of studies on education which is an

1643
02:10:42,860 --> 02:10:49,090
Institution that I particularly despise because I think that all it does is almost all it does now is produce

1644
02:10:49,970 --> 02:10:51,970
indoctrinate Errs of Children

1645
02:10:52,310 --> 02:10:56,080
It's not an easy. It's not an easily easy problem to solve

1646
02:10:57,290 --> 02:10:59,060
so

1647
02:10:59,060 --> 02:11:02,050
more more power to you wanting to

1648
02:11:04,040 --> 02:11:07,780
Put your children in a situation where they're not being indoctrinated

1649
02:11:08,420 --> 02:11:12,340
But the alternative is very very complicated and difficult

1650
02:11:13,070 --> 02:11:14,720
so

1651
02:11:14,720 --> 02:11:16,720
Yeah

1652
02:11:31,940 --> 02:11:33,650
likely

1653
02:11:33,650 --> 02:11:35,799
You know I would say

1654
02:11:36,560 --> 02:11:38,270
Generally speaking

1655
02:11:38,270 --> 02:11:43,839
there's a shamanic basis to to almost all the religious traditions because

1656
02:11:44,300 --> 02:11:51,520
That's the milieu out of which the religious traditions Emerge now. I can't say much more than that because I don't know

1657
02:11:53,150 --> 02:11:55,150
And no one does that

1658
02:11:55,420 --> 02:12:01,239
The particularity mean you might say well is there an allusion to the ingestion of psychoactive?

1659
02:12:02,000 --> 02:12:03,680
chemicals in the Adam and Eve story

1660
02:12:03,680 --> 02:12:09,069
And people have made that case and there's been powerful cases made so there's a book for example

1661
02:12:09,070 --> 02:12:14,560
I think it's called Soma by a guy named Gordon Wausau who was the first person an amateur?

1662
02:12:14,900 --> 02:12:18,069
mycologist who was the first person to propose that the soma of the

1663
02:12:18,680 --> 02:12:22,449
Hindus was we're at Amanita Muscaria mushrooms

1664
02:12:22,449 --> 02:12:28,599
Which is actually a those are the the red mushrooms with the white dots that you always see on Fairytales, you know the cute ones

1665
02:12:29,930 --> 02:12:31,910
Toadstools

1666
02:12:31,910 --> 02:12:38,379
Flies like to eat them they're called fly agaric also, and why seem to like getting stoned. I know that's weird

1667
02:12:38,560 --> 02:12:40,280
I know that's weird thing to say

1668
02:12:40,280 --> 02:12:45,580
But there's I have a good book on animal use of psychedelics and more animals use them than you might think

1669
02:12:45,800 --> 02:12:48,610
But anyways there is some evidence that

1670
02:12:49,310 --> 02:12:54,279
You know of use of of the injecting of fruits let's say

1671
02:12:54,650 --> 02:13:00,699
Metaphorically speaking as an aid to the transformation of consciousness that goes back so far that well

1672
02:13:01,280 --> 02:13:04,660
forever as far as human beings are concerned, but to

1673
02:13:05,510 --> 02:13:13,060
Specifically tie that to the Adam and eve story. I haven't been able to see any evidence. That would definitely link them

1674
02:13:13,060 --> 02:13:17,830
You know there's there's been a lot of interesting books written about that. There's one. That was quite a

1675
02:13:18,350 --> 02:13:19,840
kind of a weird hit

1676
02:13:19,840 --> 02:13:25,330
And I think in the early late 60s might have been early 70s sort of got brushed off as a hippie book

1677
02:13:25,330 --> 02:13:27,910
But it really wasn't it's called the sacred mushroom in the cross

1678
02:13:28,550 --> 02:13:32,170
Absolutely, that's the sort of book you read you think huh I?

1679
02:13:33,320 --> 02:13:34,660
Don't know

1680
02:13:34,660 --> 02:13:38,470
what to do about that I have no idea what to do about that look so

1681
02:13:39,260 --> 02:13:41,260
That's all I can say about that

1682
02:13:41,630 --> 02:13:43,630
Yep

1683
02:13:49,220 --> 02:13:52,090
my questions about martyrdom so um

1684
02:13:52,580 --> 02:14:00,189
what do you think martyrdom or the willingness to suffer and die for what you believe if anything says of the conviction and

1685
02:14:00,890 --> 02:14:05,050
What do you think is the benefit for the Martyr which is at least traditionally?

1686
02:14:05,630 --> 02:14:11,019
immaterial and transcendent good compared to the regular sacrifice or practical

1687
02:14:11,840 --> 02:14:16,840
Sacrifice which is ordered to the future material psychological or economic good?

1688
02:14:18,560 --> 02:14:21,910
Man You guys really come up with some wicked questions. I

1689
02:14:26,810 --> 02:14:30,400
Think it depends to some degree on how you define martyrdom

1690
02:14:31,220 --> 02:14:32,870
you know

1691
02:14:32,870 --> 02:14:36,039
because you could you could define it as the

1692
02:14:38,270 --> 02:14:42,790
Tendency to pathologically self aggrandizing self on public display, or you

1693
02:14:43,490 --> 02:14:50,650
Could say it's the decision to be immovable about a set of principles right so let's go with that one forget about the first one

1694
02:14:52,040 --> 02:14:57,640
well, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone right in some sense it's it's

1695
02:15:03,030 --> 02:15:05,030
That's a really tough one

1696
02:15:07,920 --> 02:15:10,310
People ask me. I'll make it personal

1697
02:15:10,310 --> 02:15:16,220
I suppose people asked me when I first got involved in saw this political controversy back in September October

1698
02:15:16,680 --> 02:15:17,180
well

1699
02:15:17,180 --> 02:15:21,860
They asked me a couple of things they they asked me if this was the hill that I really would choose to die on us

1700
02:15:21,860 --> 02:15:24,949
like pronouns and the Transgender issue

1701
02:15:26,910 --> 02:15:28,460
Yeah, well it's not what about one

1702
02:15:28,460 --> 02:15:34,040
I would have picked and but I mean it was about language you know and that that makes it non-trivial

1703
02:15:34,040 --> 02:15:38,870
I mean bill C 16 was passed this week as you know and one of the things that was quite interesting about that

1704
02:15:38,870 --> 02:15:44,930
I will answer your question was that Brenda Cosman who was the woman that I debated I think it's

1705
02:15:46,170 --> 02:15:51,530
One of the persons that I debated didn't like to be referred to as a woman, but I don't didn't think it was Brenda

1706
02:15:52,170 --> 02:15:55,580
Anyways, she wrote an op-ed, and I believe it was in the globe and mail

1707
02:15:55,580 --> 02:16:01,700
But it might have been the national post saying as I knew she would say that bill C. 16 was just the beginning

1708
02:16:02,430 --> 02:16:05,269
That we have plenty of work left to do and yes

1709
02:16:05,270 --> 02:16:10,550
You can bloody well be sure that we have plenty of work left to do anyways. I was asked during that period of time

1710
02:16:10,830 --> 02:16:16,189
Whether or not I was being a martyr you know, and I thought well. It's not really one of my ambitions

1711
02:16:16,190 --> 02:16:19,669
You know it's like that's sort of torn to the lions thing doesn't sound like

1712
02:16:20,730 --> 02:16:22,730
exactly something you might aim for

1713
02:16:27,570 --> 02:16:29,570
But I think

1714
02:16:29,880 --> 02:16:35,449
Well sometimes you find out in your life. Maybe that there's something you won't do and

1715
02:16:36,360 --> 02:16:37,830
one thing and

1716
02:16:37,830 --> 02:16:41,450
Then maybe you just don't do it no matter what the consequence is

1717
02:16:41,610 --> 02:16:45,289
Maybe I don't know because you know I haven't been pushed to that point

1718
02:16:45,290 --> 02:16:48,140
But there have been people who have been pushed to that point in history

1719
02:16:48,140 --> 02:16:52,489
And they basically said I don't care what you do to me. I'm not doing that and

1720
02:16:53,969 --> 02:16:59,839
You know maybe some of them were suicidal and some of them were psychotic and some of them had whatever other problems that people might?

1721
02:16:59,840 --> 02:17:05,360
have but yeah, I do have this suspicion now, and then that some of them were just kind of serious about and saying no and

1722
02:17:06,060 --> 02:17:11,600
There's some utility in being serious about saying no, and it that sort of revealed itself to me

1723
02:17:11,600 --> 02:17:16,179
I suppose to some degree back in September. We and I read a piece of legislation

1724
02:17:16,249 --> 02:17:22,329
That said I would have to use some words that were legislated by the government, and I thought there's no goddamn way

1725
02:17:22,849 --> 02:17:28,988
I'm going to do that under any conditions that I can imagine now there are conditions

1726
02:17:28,989 --> 02:17:32,439
And I have a pretty good imagination for unimaginable conditions. I

1727
02:17:33,109 --> 02:17:38,738
Couldn't see it because I thought that if I did that I would break through whatever would be left of me

1728
02:17:39,229 --> 02:17:42,309
After having done. That would no longer be me and

1729
02:17:43,939 --> 02:17:47,618
I'm not interested in that I know what that would be like

1730
02:17:47,619 --> 02:17:54,159
I actually do know what that would be like and I'm not interested in that I would rather have whatever else happens

1731
02:17:54,920 --> 02:18:00,759
Happen and people have said to me. Well you're so courageous for taking this stand. It's like yeah, well

1732
02:18:00,760 --> 02:18:05,229
I'm not going to claim any sort of other world courage I can tell you that but I can tell but one thing I do

1733
02:18:05,229 --> 02:18:08,108
Know the difference between these different forms of hell

1734
02:18:08,300 --> 02:18:13,749
Let's put it that way, and there's the hell that maybe I might be dragged through if I don't

1735
02:18:15,170 --> 02:18:16,399
Agree

1736
02:18:16,399 --> 02:18:18,488
Don't act in accordance with this law

1737
02:18:18,489 --> 02:18:23,889
And there's the hell that I would be dragged through if I did act in accordance with the law and I would vastly

1738
02:18:24,199 --> 02:18:29,439
Prefer the first hell to the second and isn't clear to me that that actually constitutes courage

1739
02:18:30,349 --> 02:18:33,578
Is it useful because that's also the question about martyrdom

1740
02:18:33,579 --> 02:18:39,159
I think it's very useful for people to see that someone will say there's no way

1741
02:18:40,099 --> 02:18:45,068
there's no conceivable way that you can get me to do that and

1742
02:18:45,829 --> 02:18:50,859
and I've thought long and hard about such things too because I've taught very many people to negotiate and

1743
02:18:50,989 --> 02:18:55,569
One of the things I always teach them is you don't negotiate from a position of weakness

1744
02:18:56,659 --> 02:18:58,369
because you lose and

1745
02:18:58,369 --> 02:19:04,689
So if I say no to something, and I mean no, I mean no

1746
02:19:04,699 --> 02:19:06,879
I bloody well won't do it

1747
02:19:06,880 --> 02:19:12,670
And I think that if there are people who also agree that such things aren't appropriate

1748
02:19:13,130 --> 02:19:16,149
To have the example of someone who says no

1749
02:19:16,149 --> 02:19:23,709
And means it actually turns out to be useful and so then I would say well that's an inclination in the potential

1750
02:19:23,960 --> 02:19:25,960
Direction of Martyrdom and

1751
02:19:26,989 --> 02:19:31,179
but I don't see how to distinguish that that from actually just having the courage of your

1752
02:19:31,370 --> 02:19:38,110
Convictions, and so sometimes you might say well a person who has sufficient courage in their convictions will sometimes be put to death

1753
02:19:38,960 --> 02:19:41,169
Well, if that's the definition of a martyr then

1754
02:19:42,170 --> 02:19:46,719
Sometimes but not all of all ways that's a really good thing and one of the things

1755
02:19:46,719 --> 02:19:49,029
I really liked about solzhenitsyn's book the gulag archipelago

1756
02:19:49,220 --> 02:19:55,480
Which is an I refer to it often it's an absolutely staggering book is that he?

1757
02:19:55,851 --> 02:20:01,960
Put in many many stories of people who were in the gulag and they were often religious believers

1758
02:20:01,960 --> 02:20:06,669
Which was a shock to him because he was an atheistic Communist when when he first entered the Camp's

1759
02:20:06,980 --> 02:20:10,629
They were often religious believers, and they were people who said no

1760
02:20:11,811 --> 02:20:17,770
there were things they would not do they would not participate in what the regime was asking them to do and

1761
02:20:18,290 --> 02:20:23,620
he you have to read it because the devils in the stories write the details in the stories, but

1762
02:20:25,250 --> 02:20:31,839
solzhenitsyn in the Camps grew to have tremendous admiration for such people and actually viewed them as

1763
02:20:33,170 --> 02:20:34,550
exemplars of

1764
02:20:34,550 --> 02:20:36,940
the mode of being that was

1765
02:20:37,190 --> 02:20:44,799
necessary for him to escape both the Communist propaganda that had shaped him as an individual and also the terrible bitterness and

1766
02:20:45,110 --> 02:20:52,449
Sorrow and anger that he experienced as a consequence of being flung into the terrible concentration camp conditions of the gulag archipelago

1767
02:20:53,450 --> 02:20:55,450
so

1768
02:20:56,480 --> 02:20:58,480
Yep

1769
02:21:04,359 --> 02:21:08,849
Hey, Doc. Thanks for staying alive and potentially saving humanity

1770
02:21:10,359 --> 02:21:17,099
Yeah, that's good stuff. I'm wondering about a couple of things firstly who won that childhood fight. You kind of let that

1771
02:21:17,920 --> 02:21:22,620
Let that just slide, so I'm thinking it's a big L. Well, I can tell you because he

1772
02:21:23,710 --> 02:21:27,120
Was a tough little kid see I don't remember. What happened

1773
02:21:27,120 --> 02:21:32,490
but my remembrance of him was that he could eat pound meal pretty pretty effectively so

1774
02:21:33,100 --> 02:21:36,300
Yeah, yeah, his name was Vernon Switchin ik

1775
02:21:37,450 --> 02:21:43,439
Yeah, he was really the good friend of mine and and I think I think Vernon still lives in Fairview

1776
02:21:43,439 --> 02:21:48,358
so if if he hears of this, then maybe he'll remember that too and and

1777
02:21:49,359 --> 02:21:51,279
Know you know

1778
02:21:51,279 --> 02:21:56,159
So probably he would have won. I didn't win that many physical fights when I was a kid, so

1779
02:21:56,890 --> 02:21:58,890
That's not the only question okay

1780
02:21:59,529 --> 02:22:07,079
Anyway cool. I'm not sure if you if you've actually been asked us before I've missed the last two lectures, but I

1781
02:22:07,779 --> 02:22:09,460
Wondering what your thoughts are on

1782
02:22:09,460 --> 02:22:14,339
Polkan Jr.. Tolkien and his work, not just lord of the rings, but the similar alien

1783
02:22:14,340 --> 02:22:19,979
Which is basically like I'm seeing all this and I'm thinking it's like the Modern Bible in a way

1784
02:22:19,979 --> 02:22:23,188
it's got the weird names like to Paul cain and all that stuff and

1785
02:22:23,500 --> 02:22:29,250
And specifically when we were talking about cain just now and how he was thing just moving

1786
02:22:29,890 --> 02:22:36,510
And he was talking about how he felt like betrayed by God and you any misspent his whole life working

1787
02:22:37,960 --> 02:22:44,309
It to spite him essentially and he kind of set the path for for the darkness in humanity. Yeah, that's

1788
02:22:45,160 --> 02:22:46,359
almost exactly

1789
02:22:46,359 --> 02:22:48,989
Melkor which was in the Silmarillion, basically

1790
02:22:48,990 --> 02:22:53,699
What's what spawned everything evil in Middle Earth and Mordor and what not and I don't even know

1791
02:22:53,700 --> 02:23:00,029
I won't be welcome talking with a student of mythology and you know the the

1792
02:23:00,819 --> 02:23:02,020
the

1793
02:23:02,020 --> 02:23:03,279
the

1794
02:23:03,279 --> 02:23:09,989
story of the Hobbit is a retelling of beowulf in large part, and that's a dragon slaying myth and and

1795
02:23:10,960 --> 02:23:14,219
so the the the reason the tolkien and

1796
02:23:14,890 --> 02:23:21,840
rolling for that are so popular is because they've done a very good job of making the old myths new and

1797
02:23:22,510 --> 02:23:28,410
And well look what's happened with the marvel series. It's the same thing and with Star wars and all of that

1798
02:23:28,410 --> 02:23:34,799
Is that you can't not respond to these stories now. You're going to find them in one form or another and sometimes

1799
02:23:35,800 --> 02:23:37,800
well with the biblical stories for example

1800
02:23:38,140 --> 02:23:42,149
the mythological the meaning of the mythological content has become

1801
02:23:42,489 --> 02:23:47,369
Invisible that's partly the death of God that Nietzsche was referring to but that doesn't mean that the stories themselves

1802
02:23:48,489 --> 02:23:51,029
Vanish because people have an eternal hunger for them

1803
02:23:51,340 --> 02:23:56,910
Now the problem with them emerging in let's say more literary or less sophisticated

1804
02:23:57,189 --> 02:24:00,898
Form let's take the Marvel movies as an example. Is that they're not

1805
02:24:01,660 --> 02:24:06,929
Surrounded by an articulated culture the same way the biblical stories are so for example

1806
02:24:07,390 --> 02:24:14,040
They're not surrounded by something like Paradise lost by John Milton which or or dante's inferno. Which are works of

1807
02:24:15,460 --> 02:24:21,149
unlimited depth and so you throw away something of great value and

1808
02:24:21,970 --> 02:24:23,970
Reacquire it in a different place

1809
02:24:24,189 --> 02:24:30,719
With less value perhaps, but more comprehensibility. It's not it's not a great trade. That is not a critique of tolkien

1810
02:24:30,720 --> 02:24:36,870
it's not a critique of anybody who's drawing on mythological stories for their narratives you have to do that to be a good storyteller, but

1811
02:24:38,109 --> 02:24:42,359
it's nice to go as close to the source as you can as well, so

1812
02:24:43,090 --> 02:24:45,599
Yeah, and the overlaps that you described well

1813
02:24:45,600 --> 02:24:45,750
Yeah

1814
02:24:45,750 --> 02:24:48,929
It's exactly what you'd expect because if you deal with great

1815
02:24:49,359 --> 02:24:54,719
Mythological themes you start to get the archetypes are at the bottom of stories and so

1816
02:24:55,810 --> 02:25:01,979
If the story goes down far enough it runs into the archetypes and that well that was jung's claim

1817
02:25:01,979 --> 02:25:04,438
and I think he got that exactly right, so

1818
02:25:11,569 --> 02:25:13,569
last one

1819
02:25:16,039 --> 02:25:19,059
There's a passage in Paradise lost where

1820
02:25:19,760 --> 02:25:22,689
the Demons are building pandemonium under

1821
02:25:23,479 --> 02:25:28,748
Mammon's Sort of Guidance, and they crack open the it's not really Earth, but hell

1822
02:25:28,749 --> 02:25:32,979
And they take out the gold and they build pandemonium, which is the most sophisticated

1823
02:25:33,619 --> 02:25:35,119
Architectural wonder

1824
02:25:35,119 --> 02:25:37,929
of all time in Milton's language and

1825
02:25:38,449 --> 02:25:43,118
and this this conception of taking material and turning it into a

1826
02:25:43,760 --> 02:25:45,760
temple to oneself

1827
02:25:46,310 --> 02:25:52,689
was interpreted by humphrey Jennings who was the founder of the mass observation movement if anyone saw the opening to the

1828
02:25:53,119 --> 02:25:55,119
Britons 2012 games

1829
02:25:56,209 --> 02:26:03,878
The history of the Industrial revolution. He said was encapsulated by this passage in Milton. Where you have

1830
02:26:04,489 --> 02:26:12,219
Demons building a temple for themselves out of matter and that mankind in Milton's language was was taught to do this

1831
02:26:12,890 --> 02:26:18,430
Or that they learned it first by this example and says let not envy that

1832
02:26:19,100 --> 02:26:21,100
devils have riches in hell

1833
02:26:21,649 --> 02:26:28,389
And I see things in this one the the gnostic idea that somehow the world itself that we inhabit is hell

1834
02:26:28,669 --> 02:26:35,679
ultimate that matter is not our true places of existence, but somewhere is sort of platonic and

1835
02:26:36,289 --> 02:26:40,449
Also, the toasty and sort of bargain that people made around

1836
02:26:41,060 --> 02:26:45,970
1666 to to get a world of stuff and seeing some possession

1837
02:26:46,550 --> 02:26:49,089
by losing a soul

1838
02:26:50,180 --> 02:26:55,629
yeah, but existed before that and I wonder if that I play with that a lot in my own thought and I wonder if that's

1839
02:26:55,629 --> 02:27:01,689
Something that you found in Milton and what you think of that passage in particular well Milton was definitely a prophetic voice

1840
02:27:02,569 --> 02:27:05,948
Right and I think that's that's a perfectly reasonable

1841
02:27:07,010 --> 02:27:08,659
Retelling of that

1842
02:27:08,659 --> 02:27:14,049
Section it's also very much akin to the story of the tower of babel. We'll talk about next week

1843
02:27:22,250 --> 02:27:25,330
See the problem with the problem. God

1844
02:27:25,330 --> 02:27:29,919
it's so complicated see what one of the things that jung said about the transformation of

1845
02:27:30,351 --> 02:27:36,820
The first millennium of Christianity into let's say the second millennium of Christianity was that Christianity had promised

1846
02:27:37,431 --> 02:27:40,600
something like redemption universal redemption from suffering

1847
02:27:41,480 --> 02:27:44,169
Maybe in the afterlife, but that was kind of a cop-out

1848
02:27:44,570 --> 02:27:49,509
let's say because it didn't really solve the problem of suffering here and now and you believe that as

1849
02:27:51,681 --> 02:27:53,890
People had although although it

1850
02:27:53,891 --> 02:27:55,880
Did many it did many positive things?

1851
02:27:55,880 --> 02:28:01,930
Let's not let's not forget that it civilized people in a way that they hadn't been before or you could make that case

1852
02:28:02,360 --> 02:28:04,360
But then there was this underground

1853
02:28:05,480 --> 02:28:10,869
at the same time there's this denial of the utility of material reality that went along with the

1854
02:28:11,391 --> 02:28:15,100
spiritualization of mankind in that in that first in the Christian millennium

1855
02:28:15,771 --> 02:28:22,510
there was value left in material because it had been ignored and so then jung believed that the

1856
02:28:23,300 --> 02:28:25,780
the collective unconscious broadly speaking

1857
02:28:26,750 --> 02:28:30,430
Began to be attracted to the to what had been rejected by the hyper

1858
02:28:31,070 --> 02:28:37,900
spiritualization and started to question whether or not additional value could be extracted from the material may be as a

1859
02:28:38,660 --> 02:28:42,249
adjunct to the spiritual because maybe true redemption was something like a

1860
02:28:42,380 --> 02:28:45,640
proper meeting of the spiritual in the material which wasn't

1861
02:28:45,710 --> 02:28:50,500
Something that seemed to be part and parcel of Christian Christian doctrine up to that point

1862
02:28:51,500 --> 02:28:53,181
now

1863
02:28:53,181 --> 02:28:56,860
Maybe what Milton was warning against was a swing to far, right?

1864
02:28:56,860 --> 02:29:02,919
And I think Milton's point is well-taken because one of the things that's worth noting is that

1865
02:29:03,290 --> 02:29:06,040
You can be perfectly miserable in a house of gold

1866
02:29:06,710 --> 02:29:10,930
right I mean I've known very many wealthy people very very wealthy people and

1867
02:29:11,720 --> 02:29:17,380
The problem see the thing is is that money just doesn't solve that many problems that people have

1868
02:29:18,080 --> 02:29:19,940
people wish it would

1869
02:29:19,940 --> 02:29:22,989
People who want to be rich think it will and the people who want to?

1870
02:29:23,090 --> 02:29:29,380
Redistribute money think it will and I know that there's nothing to be said for abject poverty, but the problem is is that

1871
02:29:30,290 --> 02:29:34,950
There are many see arius problems that human beings have that matter

1872
02:29:36,370 --> 02:29:37,780
material

1873
02:29:37,780 --> 02:29:40,590
Comfort alone does nothing to address

1874
02:29:41,141 --> 02:29:48,570
or almost nothing you can be perfectly you can have a perfectly miserable family life and twenty million dollars and

1875
02:29:49,181 --> 02:29:57,120
The buffer that the twenty million dollars puts between you and the misery is it sometimes. It's not even a buffer. It's a magnifier, so

1876
02:30:00,190 --> 02:30:02,190
melding would warn against

1877
02:30:03,011 --> 02:30:05,011
the creation of

1878
02:30:05,471 --> 02:30:08,640
even the idea of a material utopia even in principle

1879
02:30:09,431 --> 02:30:12,150
Something dostoevsky also recognized as an error

1880
02:30:12,641 --> 02:30:18,511
You cannot solve the problem in that Manner and maybe the demonic idea is

1881
02:30:19,931 --> 02:30:21,931
that is

1882
02:30:21,971 --> 02:30:23,971
propaganda that you could

1883
02:30:24,370 --> 02:30:25,601
now maybe

1884
02:30:25,601 --> 02:30:31,770
Maybe there is a balance of some sort because I don't understand if we were going to build the city of God let's say

1885
02:30:32,320 --> 02:30:36,360
well a huge part of the endeavor would have to be spiritual and

1886
02:30:36,641 --> 02:30:41,341
to me that a huge part of that would be it would have to be something predicated if

1887
02:30:41,710 --> 02:30:47,940
Not on truth at least not at least on the willingness of people not to lie to one another

1888
02:30:48,670 --> 02:30:52,140
Without that all the material well-being in the world is

1889
02:30:53,950 --> 02:30:58,320
It's a façade. It's like gilding a corpse, right?

1890
02:30:58,320 --> 02:31:02,669
And I think that's partly what Milton was warning against

1891
02:31:02,670 --> 02:31:08,640
I mean Milton was doing many more things than he knew of course because he was a poetic genius of

1892
02:31:09,431 --> 02:31:11,410
incalculable

1893
02:31:11,410 --> 02:31:13,301
genius

1894
02:31:13,301 --> 02:31:14,300
right right right

1895
02:31:14,300 --> 02:31:20,250
right so well you've obviously thought about such things very much, so that was a very good question, so

1896
02:31:21,040 --> 02:31:23,040
Alright everyone, good night.
