1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:06,740
[Music]

2
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:20,710
hello everyone so hopefully we're going

3
00:00:18,699 --> 00:00:25,990
to get past Genesis 1 today that's the

4
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:27,470
theory so I finished my new book

5
00:00:25,990 --> 00:00:31,880
yesterday

6
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:31,880
[Applause]

7
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:39,290
yes that's that's taken about three

8
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:43,010
years of writing it's quite a long time

9
00:00:39,290 --> 00:00:45,590
to write something so yeah it's done

10
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:46,970
except for the mopping up you know copy

11
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:49,010
editing and that sort of thing so

12
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:50,360
hopefully it's as good as I can make it

13
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:52,489
I don't know if that's any good but it's

14
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:57,769
as good as I can make it anyways all

15
00:00:52,489 --> 00:00:59,480
right so this is the stories that I'm

16
00:00:57,769 --> 00:01:01,340
gonna tell you tonight I've been

17
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:03,019
thinking about well like the ones last

18
00:01:01,340 --> 00:01:04,430
week for that matter for a very long

19
00:01:03,019 --> 00:01:07,009
period of time but I think these even

20
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:09,649
longer and one of the things that I just

21
00:01:07,009 --> 00:01:12,440
do not understand I cannot fathom this I

22
00:01:09,649 --> 00:01:15,860
I cannot understand how there can be so

23
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:18,020
much information in such tiny little

24
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:19,910
stories especially the story of Cain and

25
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:25,100
Abel that story just every time I read

26
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:29,479
it it just flattens me because it it's

27
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:31,970
only like a paragraph long there's just

28
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:33,380
nothing to it you know and I think about

29
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:35,149
it I think about it and I think about it

30
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:37,490
I think about it and every time I think

31
00:01:35,149 --> 00:01:39,020
about it another layer comes out from

32
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:40,910
underneath and then another layer comes

33
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:43,069
out for underneath it and I can't figure

34
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:45,410
that out like you know the rational

35
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:48,440
approach that I've been describing to

36
00:01:45,410 --> 00:01:51,560
you is predicated on the idea that these

37
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:53,959
stories have somehow encapsulated wisdom

38
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:56,569
that we generated interpersonally and

39
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:58,190
behaviorally and that an image over very

40
00:01:56,569 --> 00:02:00,520
vast stretches of time and then

41
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:02,840
condensed it into very very dense

42
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:06,200
articulated words that are then further

43
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:08,270
refined by the act of being remembered

44
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,440
and transmitted and remembered and

45
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:11,000
transmitted and remembered and

46
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,770
transmitted over vast stretches of time

47
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,459
and that's a pretty good argument I'm

48
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:18,800
willing to I'm willing to go with it but

49
00:02:15,459 --> 00:02:23,650
it still never ceases to amaze me how

50
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:29,870
much information such tiny little

51
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:32,629
passages can can contain so we'll take

52
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:34,040
that apart today and I think it's

53
00:02:32,629 --> 00:02:37,129
especially true with the story of Cain

54
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:38,569
and Abel because it it works on the

55
00:02:37,129 --> 00:02:40,190
individual level and it works on the

56
00:02:38,569 --> 00:02:42,050
familial level and it works on the

57
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:43,610
political level and it works at the

58
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:45,380
level of warfare and it works at the

59
00:02:43,610 --> 00:02:47,510
level of economics and

60
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:50,090
it's that's a lot for a little tiny

61
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:52,700
one-paragraph story to cover man now you

62
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:54,080
know you could object well with these

63
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:55,610
stories you never know what you're

64
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,290
reading into it and what's in the story

65
00:02:55,610 --> 00:03:00,080
right that's part of let's call it the

66
00:02:57,290 --> 00:03:02,780
postmodern dilemma and and fair enough

67
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,640
and there's really no answer to that any

68
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:05,900
more than there is an answer to how do

69
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,300
you know your interpretation of the

70
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:10,580
world is well let's not say correct but

71
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:13,190
sufficient there's some answer to that

72
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:14,390
it's it's sufficient in if you can act

73
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:16,010
it out in the world and other people

74
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:17,930
don't object too much and you don't die

75
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:20,660
and nature doesn't take a bite out of

76
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:21,950
you any more often than necessary you

77
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:24,380
know those are the constraints within

78
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:26,450
which we live so it you have some way of

79
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:29,300
determining whether your interpretation

80
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:33,470
is at least functionally successful and

81
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:34,910
that's and that's not trivial and I

82
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:37,040
guess you can say the same thing to the

83
00:03:34,910 --> 00:03:38,840
interpretations that might be laid out

84
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,090
on these stories and at the moment

85
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,710
that's probably good enough hopefully

86
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:45,380
you find the interpretations

87
00:03:42,710 --> 00:03:47,090
functionally significant at multiple

88
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:49,220
levels and I also think the chance of

89
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:51,800
managing that by chance is very very

90
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:53,750
small you know to be able to pull off an

91
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,610
interpretation of a story that works at

92
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:58,760
multiple levels simultaneously you think

93
00:03:55,610 --> 00:04:00,470
with each level that it applies the

94
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:02,270
chances that you've stumbled across

95
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:04,430
something by chance have to be

96
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:05,810
decreasing right that there's a

97
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:08,060
technical term for that in psychology

98
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:11,270
it's called something like multi method

99
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:12,560
multi trait method of determining

100
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:15,860
whether or not something is accurate and

101
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:18,100
the idea is them the more ways that you

102
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:20,959
can measure it and get the same result

103
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:22,850
the more confident you can be that

104
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,980
you're not just deluding yourself with

105
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:27,350
your a priori hypothesis you know that

106
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:28,430
there's actually something out there so

107
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:30,800
I guess that's another part of this

108
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:32,780
method is that and it's also a method

109
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,970
that I use in my in my speaking I think

110
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:36,950
I don't try to tell people anything that

111
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:38,630
isn't personally relevant you know

112
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:40,700
because you should know why you are

113
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:42,920
being taught something right you should

114
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:44,420
know what the fact is good for and then

115
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:46,010
it should be good for you personally at

116
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:47,150
least in some sense and then if you act

117
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:49,070
it out in the world it should be good

118
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:50,300
for your family and maybe should have

119
00:04:49,070 --> 00:04:52,070
some significance for the broader

120
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:54,140
community and I think that's what

121
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:56,750
meaning means and I don't really see the

122
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:58,400
utility in being taught things that

123
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:59,180
aren't meaningful facts that aren't

124
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,740
meaningful because

125
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:01,729
there's an infinite number of facts and

126
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:04,039
there's no way you're going to remember

127
00:05:01,729 --> 00:05:06,470
all of them they have to be they have to

128
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:08,150
have the aspect of tools essentially

129
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:09,830
something like that because we are tool

130
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:12,770
using creatures while these these

131
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:17,509
stories have that aspect is as far as I

132
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:20,300
can tell there's nothing there's no

133
00:05:17,509 --> 00:05:23,389
doubt about that so here's the stories

134
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:25,880
in Genesis two very famous stories

135
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:28,639
obviously virtually everybody who's even

136
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:32,750
vaguely versed in Western roughly

137
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:34,729
speaking Western Western culture knows

138
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:36,590
these stories and that's something

139
00:05:34,729 --> 00:05:38,240
that's interesting too that stories can

140
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:39,710
be so foundational that everybody shares

141
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,300
them I mean you can say the same thing

142
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:43,160
about a fairly large handful of fairy

143
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:47,300
tales as well or you could at least

144
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:49,190
until recently but the fact that stories

145
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:52,639
are foundational I think also means that

146
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:54,590
they have to be given a kind of well

147
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:56,630
even if you don't give them any respect

148
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:58,639
you have to at least treat them as

149
00:05:56,630 --> 00:06:01,280
remarkable curiosities

150
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,380
so why those stories and why did they

151
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,510
stick around and why does everybody know

152
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:07,039
them and it's not self-evident by any

153
00:06:05,510 --> 00:06:09,320
stretch of the imagination and you can

154
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:12,340
use explanations can use the Freudian

155
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:14,960
explanation Freud sort of thought that

156
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:17,780
the judeo-christian was predicated on

157
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:22,010
the idea that the figure of the father

158
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:23,539
the familial father was expanded up into

159
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:25,940
cosmic dimensions so that mankind

160
00:06:23,539 --> 00:06:27,889
existed in the same relationship to the

161
00:06:25,940 --> 00:06:30,919
cosmic father let's say that an infant

162
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:35,150
or a small child existed in relationship

163
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:38,840
to his or her own father and that's a

164
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:41,960
reasonable critique I would say to some

165
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:46,039
degree but it does and and and this was

166
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:50,050
purposeful it does imply more than imply

167
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:53,030
and for its case that people who adopt

168
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:55,520
religious belief that has a personified

169
00:06:53,030 --> 00:06:58,370
figure as at its apex are essentially

170
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:00,380
acting out the role of dependent

171
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:02,030
children and you know I thought about

172
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:03,440
that critique for a long time and

173
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:04,970
believe me that's been a powerful

174
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,979
critique one of the best books I've ever

175
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:08,870
read called the denial of death by

176
00:07:06,979 --> 00:07:11,810
Ernest Becker I think took that line of

177
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:12,689
argumentation it developed it as well as

178
00:07:11,810 --> 00:07:15,799
any

179
00:07:12,689 --> 00:07:18,089
any book I've ever seen argue it

180
00:07:15,799 --> 00:07:21,629
Becker tried to bring closure to

181
00:07:18,089 --> 00:07:23,189
Freudian psychoanalysis on religion he

182
00:07:21,629 --> 00:07:25,769
did a pretty wicked job of it like I

183
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:28,589
think the book is seriously flawed and

184
00:07:25,769 --> 00:07:30,539
wrong but it's really a great book like

185
00:07:28,589 --> 00:07:32,069
some books are well some books are wrong

186
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:33,959
in really good ways right they make a

187
00:07:32,069 --> 00:07:35,099
powerful powerful argument they really

188
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:39,389
take it to its extreme

189
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:41,849
I think Becker missed the point and he

190
00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:44,549
missed it in the same way that Freud

191
00:07:41,849 --> 00:07:47,369
missed Jung's point and Becker who wrote

192
00:07:44,549 --> 00:07:48,719
this book on the psychology the

193
00:07:47,369 --> 00:07:50,819
psychoanalysis of religion never

194
00:07:48,719 --> 00:07:53,459
referred to Jung except very briefly in

195
00:07:50,819 --> 00:07:56,179
the introduction and I think that was a

196
00:07:53,459 --> 00:08:00,029
major mistake but Becker took the

197
00:07:56,179 --> 00:08:02,429
argument that the hypothesis of God is

198
00:08:00,029 --> 00:08:06,419
nothing but an attempt by human beings

199
00:08:02,429 --> 00:08:09,539
to recreate quasi infantile state of

200
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:11,839
dependency and to be able to rely on an

201
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:15,239
all-knowing father and to thereby

202
00:08:11,839 --> 00:08:17,029
recover the comfort perhaps that we

203
00:08:15,239 --> 00:08:19,139
experienced when we were young and had a

204
00:08:17,029 --> 00:08:21,019
hypothetically all-knowing father for

205
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:24,029
those of us who were lucky to have

206
00:08:21,019 --> 00:08:26,219
someone who rigged vaguely resembled

207
00:08:24,029 --> 00:08:29,399
that but the more I thought about that

208
00:08:26,219 --> 00:08:31,619
the more that struck me is quite

209
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:33,300
implausible across time Charles Taylor I

210
00:08:31,619 --> 00:08:36,629
think it was Charles Taylor wrote an

211
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:37,529
interesting book called the I think it

212
00:08:36,629 --> 00:08:38,219
was called the origins of the modern

213
00:08:37,529 --> 00:08:40,129
self

214
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:42,659
he's a megillah' philosopher and I

215
00:08:40,129 --> 00:08:44,250
wouldn't necessarily call him a friend

216
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:45,809
of classic religion but it doesn't

217
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:48,059
matter he made a very interesting point

218
00:08:45,809 --> 00:08:50,279
about Christianity in particular he said

219
00:08:48,059 --> 00:08:52,319
well if you're going to invent a

220
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:54,629
religion that offered you nothing but

221
00:08:52,319 --> 00:08:56,480
infantile comfort why in the world would

222
00:08:54,629 --> 00:08:58,350
you bother with conceptualizing hell

223
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:00,420
that just seems like an unnecessary

224
00:08:58,350 --> 00:09:03,809
detail to add to the whole story right

225
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:06,870
if it's it's all about comfort why would

226
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:10,259
you hypothesize that the consequence of

227
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:13,680
of serious error was eternal torment

228
00:09:10,259 --> 00:09:16,170
that doesn't really sound very it isn't

229
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,420
the sort of thing that that is likely to

230
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:19,649
make you feel comfortable James Joyce

231
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:21,230
when he wrote about that said he had

232
00:09:19,649 --> 00:09:23,910
terrible nightmares when he was a child

233
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:26,700
because of the Hellfire sermons that

234
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:29,640
Jesuits used to

235
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:31,560
spew forth let's say and he wrote down

236
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:33,540
what he remembered of them and they were

237
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:35,160
pretty hair-raising I think in James

238
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:36,750
Joyce's book I think it was portrait of

239
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:38,550
the artist of a young man man he talked

240
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:40,650
about the Jesuits telling them and

241
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:42,930
telling him that hell was a like a

242
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:44,940
prison with walls that were seven miles

243
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:47,700
thick that was always in darkness and

244
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:50,400
consumed by fire and that the people who

245
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:52,680
were trapped there were continually

246
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:54,440
burnt by this dark fire that gave new

247
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:57,450
light which also simultaneously

248
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:59,010
rejuvenated their flesh so that it could

249
00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:00,510
be burnt off eternally in case you were

250
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:02,370
wondering how it was going to be burned

251
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:04,830
off eternally that's apparently the

252
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:06,570
process it's not easy for me to see that

253
00:10:04,830 --> 00:10:09,120
as an infantile wish-fulfillment

254
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:10,920
I'm afraid now you could well you could

255
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:14,490
be a cynic about it and Elaine Pagels

256
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:15,870
who wrote a book on the devil was

257
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:18,290
cynical about it in this manner she

258
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:20,370
thought that the Christians so to speak

259
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:24,030
invented hell as a place to put their

260
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:27,450
enemies and you know yeah fair enough

261
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:29,070
but no that's not accurate really well

262
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:31,230
although it's convenient to have a place

263
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:34,140
to put your enemies Charles Taylor did

264
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:36,960
point out for example that the modern

265
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:38,970
terror of loss of self let's say the

266
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:41,100
existential loss of self and loss of

267
00:10:38,970 --> 00:10:44,280
meaning was perhaps roughly paralleled

268
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:46,560
by the medieval terror of Hell you know

269
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:48,180
in terms of existential intensity and so

270
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,680
it wasn't hell wasn't merely a place

271
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:51,300
where those people that you didn't care

272
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,830
for would end up it was the place where

273
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:55,230
you were going to go if he didn't walk

274
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:58,950
the line properly and so I don't think

275
00:10:55,230 --> 00:11:00,650
Freud's Freud's critique really holds

276
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:02,820
water in the final analysis and then

277
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:04,020
Marx's critique of course was that

278
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:06,750
religion was the opiate of the masses

279
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:08,660
and he made an argument that was similar

280
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:11,640
to Freud's although somewhat earlier and

281
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:14,430
made the based upon the presupposition

282
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:16,710
that religious beliefs were stories told

283
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:20,000
to the gullible masses in order to keep

284
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:23,070
them pacified and happy well their

285
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:26,100
corporate overlords for lack of a better

286
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:32,760
purpose continue to exploit them and and

287
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:34,680
and weaken them and you know I find that

288
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:36,840
I find the critique of human

289
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:40,650
institutions as driven entirely by power

290
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:43,530
very let's say questionable to

291
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:45,680
to say the least and of course every

292
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:49,290
human institution is corrupted by

293
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:52,310
corrupted is corrupt by for one reason

294
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:55,080
or another and it's also corrupt

295
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:56,790
specifically by such things as deception

296
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:59,340
and arrogance and and the demand for

297
00:11:56,790 --> 00:12:01,680
unearned power and the same thing of

298
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:04,470
course can be applied to religious

299
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:06,630
systems but that doesn't mean that they

300
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:09,060
are in some special way characteristic

301
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:10,620
of those false and maybe you think they

302
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:13,470
are and you know maybe you can make a

303
00:12:10,620 --> 00:12:15,480
case for it but it's not prime FSA I

304
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:19,320
think that's how you say that evident

305
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:22,980
that that is that also is a particularly

306
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:26,160
useful criticism I don't buy it

307
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:28,950
I think there's I think that's far too

308
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,870
cynical I think that the people who

309
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:31,770
wrote these stories first of all what

310
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:33,480
are you gonna do you cannot really

311
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:35,910
you're gonna run a bloody conspiracy for

312
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:37,920
three thousand years successfully it's

313
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:40,140
like good luck with that

314
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,670
can't run a conspiracy for fifteen

315
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:45,080
minutes without somebody ratting you out

316
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:47,160
you know it's it's impossible so

317
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:49,290
whatever's at the basis of the

318
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:50,970
construction not only of these stories

319
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:53,040
but of the dogmatic structures that

320
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:54,900
emerged from them I think that it's a

321
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:56,940
terrible mistake to reduce them to you

322
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:58,380
know dimensional explanations in fact I

323
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:00,300
generally think that reducing any

324
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:02,400
complex human behavior to yoona

325
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:04,890
dimensional explanation is often the

326
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:06,300
sign of a seriously limited thinker and

327
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:08,550
you know I say that with some caution

328
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:10,110
because Freud did do that with religion

329
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:12,480
at least to some degree and so it was a

330
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:19,070
serious thinker and Marx I suppose was a

331
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:19,070
serious thing or two even though well

332
00:13:21,949 --> 00:13:25,799
yeah is he someone you just if you have

333
00:13:24,419 --> 00:13:31,410
any sense marks just leaves you

334
00:13:25,799 --> 00:13:32,519
speechless so so anyway so that's all to

335
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:34,369
say that I don't think there's any

336
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:37,979
simple explanation for how these stories

337
00:13:34,369 --> 00:13:40,169
have the power that they have I I really

338
00:13:37,979 --> 00:13:42,029
don't I don't think you can reduce it to

339
00:13:40,169 --> 00:13:43,139
political conspiracy that's for sure I

340
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:46,470
don't think you can reduce it to

341
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:48,749
psychological infantilism I think you

342
00:13:46,470 --> 00:13:50,819
can make a case like I have that they

343
00:13:48,749 --> 00:13:53,939
are repositories of the collective

344
00:13:50,819 --> 00:13:55,079
wisdom of the human race I had an

345
00:13:53,939 --> 00:13:57,149
interesting letter this week from

346
00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:58,649
someone I get a lot of interesting

347
00:13:57,149 --> 00:14:00,089
letters I think I'm going to make an

348
00:13:58,649 --> 00:14:02,849
archive out of them and put them on the

349
00:14:00,089 --> 00:14:06,809
web at some point with people's

350
00:14:02,849 --> 00:14:08,279
permission obviously and he said that

351
00:14:06,809 --> 00:14:10,379
he'd been following my lectures and

352
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:12,389
noted that I had been making what you

353
00:14:10,379 --> 00:14:16,169
might describe as a quasi biological or

354
00:14:12,389 --> 00:14:17,549
evolutionary case for for the emergence

355
00:14:16,169 --> 00:14:21,239
of the information that the stories

356
00:14:17,549 --> 00:14:22,289
contained and he said well how do you

357
00:14:21,239 --> 00:14:24,179
know that someone from a different

358
00:14:22,289 --> 00:14:25,829
religious tradition or speaking of a

359
00:14:24,179 --> 00:14:28,159
different religious tradition couldn't

360
00:14:25,829 --> 00:14:31,319
do exactly the same thing and I thought

361
00:14:28,159 --> 00:14:33,659
well first of all to some degree they

362
00:14:31,319 --> 00:14:35,159
could because there is overlap like I've

363
00:14:33,659 --> 00:14:37,919
talked to you a little bit about Taoism

364
00:14:35,159 --> 00:14:41,399
for example in the Taoist view of being

365
00:14:37,919 --> 00:14:43,350
as you know the eternal balance between

366
00:14:41,399 --> 00:14:44,909
chaos and order one thing I didn't tell

367
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:46,229
you I don't think about that and I don't

368
00:14:44,909 --> 00:14:47,789
know if you know this but there's a

369
00:14:46,229 --> 00:14:50,489
neuropsychologist named Al Conan

370
00:14:47,789 --> 00:14:51,889
Goldberg who was a student of Alexander

371
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:53,850
Luria and Luria was I think the greatest

372
00:14:51,889 --> 00:14:56,579
neuropsychologist of the 20th century he

373
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:59,639
was a Russian and he was one of the

374
00:14:56,579 --> 00:15:01,470
first people to really determine in

375
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:03,119
large part the function of the frontal

376
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:05,699
cortex which was quite a mystery for a

377
00:15:03,119 --> 00:15:07,079
very long period of time and Goldberg

378
00:15:05,699 --> 00:15:08,220
you know you know how we have two

379
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:09,569
hemispheres right we have a left

380
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:11,399
hemisphere and a right hemisphere and

381
00:15:09,569 --> 00:15:12,419
people often think of the left for

382
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:14,249
right-handed people

383
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:15,779
right-handed males more particularly

384
00:15:14,249 --> 00:15:19,289
because women are more neurologically

385
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:20,759
diffuse it's one of the things that

386
00:15:19,289 --> 00:15:24,659
makes them more robust to head injury

387
00:15:20,759 --> 00:15:26,489
for example and maybe men are less

388
00:15:24,659 --> 00:15:28,049
defuses somewhat more specialized which

389
00:15:26,489 --> 00:15:31,079
makes them a bit more specialized but a

390
00:15:28,049 --> 00:15:32,540
little more subject to damage anyways we

391
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:34,010
have two hemispheres left

392
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:35,930
the right and no one exactly knows why

393
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:37,760
and we know that they how is quasi

394
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:40,370
independent consciousness is because if

395
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:44,360
you divide the corpus callosum that that

396
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:46,250
unites them which was done to in cases

397
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:48,410
of intractable epilepsy for example that

398
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:51,260
each hemisphere is capable of developing

399
00:15:48,410 --> 00:15:52,970
its own consciousness to some degree the

400
00:15:51,260 --> 00:15:54,890
right generally nonverbal and the left

401
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:56,630
verbal and so there has been this idea

402
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:58,280
that the left is a verbal Hemisphere and

403
00:15:56,630 --> 00:16:00,620
the right is a nonverbal hemisphere

404
00:15:58,280 --> 00:16:02,120
but that can't be right because of

405
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:05,000
course animals don't talk and they have

406
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:08,510
a bifurcated hemisphere so if it's right

407
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:10,040
it's not causally right now goldberg

408
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:12,590
hypothesized instead that the

409
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:14,780
hemispheres were were specialized for

410
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:18,650
routinization and non routinization or

411
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:21,110
for novelty and familiarity or for chaos

412
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:23,270
and order and so that's pretty damn cool

413
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:26,360
when i ran across that i also thought

414
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:29,630
about that as a as a signal of what

415
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:33,530
would you call it Multi method multi

416
00:16:29,630 --> 00:16:34,730
trait construct validation because I'd

417
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:36,350
never thought of the hemispheres as

418
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:39,770
operating that way and Goldberg came up

419
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:41,390
with this in a in a historical pathway

420
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:42,950
that was entirely independent from any

421
00:16:41,390 --> 00:16:45,970
mythologically inspired thinking

422
00:16:42,950 --> 00:16:48,770
completely independent in fact it was

423
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:50,800
motivated more by materialist Russian

424
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:53,450
neuro psychology which was materialist

425
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:55,790
for political reasons and also for

426
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:57,620
scientific reasons but the idea is that

427
00:16:55,790 --> 00:16:59,720
we have one hemisphere that reacts very

428
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:01,880
rapidly to things we don't know and it's

429
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:03,350
more imaginative and diffuse in it and

430
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:05,510
it's associated more with negative

431
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:06,950
emotion because negative emotion is what

432
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:08,330
you should feel immediately when you

433
00:17:06,950 --> 00:17:10,340
encounter something you don't understand

434
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:12,620
because it's a form of thinking right

435
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:14,360
negative emotion it's like I'm somewhere

436
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:16,190
where things aren't with what they

437
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:18,140
should be right hemisphere does that

438
00:17:16,190 --> 00:17:19,790
generates images very rapidly to help

439
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:22,850
you figure out what might be there and

440
00:17:19,790 --> 00:17:24,200
then the left hemisphere takes that and

441
00:17:22,850 --> 00:17:27,170
develops it into something that's more

442
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:28,820
articulated and and algorithmic and

443
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:30,590
fully understood and so then there's

444
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:32,360
this dynamic balance between the right

445
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:34,820
and the left hemisphere where the left

446
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:36,920
tries to impose order on the world

447
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:39,410
that's Ramachandran who's a neurologist

448
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:43,340
in in california very famous neuro

449
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:45,050
neuro neurologist who also developed a

450
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:46,040
theory like goldberg who said that the

451
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:48,140
left hemisphere

452
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:50,420
imposes routinized order on the world

453
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:54,650
and the right hemisphere generates

454
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:56,480
novelty and and and reacts to novelty

455
00:17:54,650 --> 00:17:57,770
and generates novel hypotheses and he

456
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,870
thought and there is some good evidence

457
00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:02,300
for this that's what's happening during

458
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:03,590
the dream is that information is moved

459
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:08,060
from the right hemisphere to the left

460
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:10,820
hemisphere in small doses basically so

461
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:12,500
that the novel revelations of the right

462
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:15,440
hemisphere don't demolish the

463
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:17,260
algorithmic structures that the left

464
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:25,040
hemisphere has so carefully put together

465
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:29,690
so and I like that theory too because it

466
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:31,250
also does help justify the hypothesis

467
00:18:29,690 --> 00:18:33,500
that I'd be laying out for you which is

468
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:35,180
that you know there's part of us that

469
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,530
extends ourselves out into the world

470
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:39,080
interest to understand what we don't

471
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:41,210
know and that that part extends itself

472
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:43,310
out with behavior and also with emotion

473
00:18:41,210 --> 00:18:44,840
and also with image and then maybe with

474
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:47,660
poetry and then maybe with storytelling

475
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:49,040
and then as that develops then we

476
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:51,470
develop more and more articulated

477
00:18:49,040 --> 00:18:53,000
representations of that emergent

478
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:55,880
knowledge and so you can map that quite

479
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,830
nicely onto the neurologists and the

480
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:00,680
neuropsychologists presumption about

481
00:18:57,830 --> 00:19:02,180
what constitutes the reason for the

482
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,440
hemispheric differentiation but the

483
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:05,090
other thing that's so cool about the

484
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,500
hemispheric differentiation argument as

485
00:19:05,090 --> 00:19:08,300
far as I'm concerned and this is really

486
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:13,520
this is worth thinking about man because

487
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:15,580
it's a real it's a real there's a word

488
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:17,690
that Ned's Ned Flanders uses for that

489
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:20,900
Norgan scratcher I think it's something

490
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:22,730
like that anyways you know we do make

491
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:25,430
the assumption that what it is that we

492
00:19:22,730 --> 00:19:27,230
are biologically adapted to is reality

493
00:19:25,430 --> 00:19:30,350
right it's actually an axiomatic

494
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:32,750
definition if you're a Darwinian because

495
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:34,910
nature is what selects by definition

496
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:37,640
that's what nature is its what selects

497
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:39,620
and if the nature that selects has

498
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:41,480
forced upon you a dual hemispheric

499
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:43,460
structure because half of you has to

500
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:45,650
deal with the chaos and half the half of

501
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:47,030
you has to deal with order then you can

502
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:48,740
make a pretty damn strong inferential

503
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:51,230
case that the world is made out of chaos

504
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:52,790
and order and that's really something to

505
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:54,890
that's really something to think about

506
00:19:52,790 --> 00:19:55,880
man you know so you can think about that

507
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:59,540
for a while if you want

508
00:19:55,880 --> 00:20:01,460
so anyways for whatever reason there is

509
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:04,010
a lot too packed into these stories and

510
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:06,140
so let's investigate a couple more of

511
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:09,940
them we'll start with this story by of

512
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:13,460
Adam and Eve now you may remember that

513
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:15,380
the Bible is a series of books Bible

514
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:16,970
actually means something akin to library

515
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:19,010
and these books were written by all

516
00:20:16,970 --> 00:20:21,080
sorts of different people and groups of

517
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:23,930
people and groups of editors and groups

518
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:26,030
of people who edited over and over

519
00:20:23,930 --> 00:20:28,790
across very very large periods of time

520
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:32,600
so they're offered by no one and many at

521
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:33,950
the same time the there was a tradition

522
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:37,190
for a long time that the earliest books

523
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:40,190
were written by Moses but that that's

524
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:42,320
probably not technically correct even

525
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:44,450
though it might be dramatically correct

526
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:47,500
let's say or correct in the way that a

527
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:49,910
fairy tale is correct and I'm I'm not

528
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:52,130
trying to put down fairy tales by saying

529
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:53,540
that but there's a number of authors and

530
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:56,050
the way the authors have been identified

531
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:58,010
tentatively is by certain stylistic

532
00:20:56,050 --> 00:21:00,410
commonalities across the different

533
00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:02,600
stories different uses of words like the

534
00:21:00,410 --> 00:21:04,910
words for God different poetic styles

535
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:06,920
different topics and so forth and people

536
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:10,040
have been working for probably 200 years

537
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:12,530
roughly that to try to sort out who

538
00:21:10,040 --> 00:21:14,390
wrote what and how that was all cobble

539
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:16,160
together but it doesn't really matter

540
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:19,330
for our purposes what matters is that

541
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:23,030
it's an aggregation of collected

542
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:24,380
narrative traditions and maybe you could

543
00:21:23,030 --> 00:21:25,760
say it's an aggregation of collective

544
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:27,080
narrative wisdom we don't have to go

545
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,720
that far but we can at least say it's

546
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:30,830
aggregated narrative traditions and that

547
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,600
there was some reason that those

548
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:34,250
traditions and all others were kept and

549
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,870
that there was some reasons complex

550
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:37,430
though they may have been why they were

551
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:38,810
sequenced in the order that they were

552
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:41,240
sequenced because one of the things

553
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:42,860
that's really remarkable about the Bible

554
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:45,440
as an as a document is that it actually

555
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:47,900
has a plot and that's really something I

556
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:49,880
mean it's it's sprawling and it goes

557
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:51,470
many places but the fact that

558
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:53,330
something's being cobbled together over

559
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:54,980
several thousand years maybe four

560
00:21:53,330 --> 00:21:57,110
thousand years maybe longer than that if

561
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:58,700
you include the oral traditions that

562
00:21:57,110 --> 00:22:01,040
preceded it and god only knows how old

563
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:04,160
those are that that collective

564
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:05,690
imagination part of the human collective

565
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:08,750
imagination has cobble together a

566
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:11,030
library with a plot and like I see the

567
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:11,389
Bible as an attempt a collective attempt

568
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:13,579
by hee

569
00:22:11,389 --> 00:22:15,619
you solve the deepest problems that we

570
00:22:13,579 --> 00:22:18,440
have and I think those problems are the

571
00:22:15,619 --> 00:22:21,169
problems of primarily that the problem

572
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:22,999
of self-consciousness the fact that not

573
00:22:21,169 --> 00:22:24,859
only do we are immortal and that we die

574
00:22:22,999 --> 00:22:29,869
but that we know it and that's the

575
00:22:24,859 --> 00:22:31,070
unique that's the unique predicament of

576
00:22:29,869 --> 00:22:32,359
human beings and it makes all the

577
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:33,919
difference and I think that's laid out

578
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:36,529
in Adam and Eve in the story of Adam and

579
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:39,499
Eve I think the reason that that makes

580
00:22:36,529 --> 00:22:42,649
us unique and is laid out in that story

581
00:22:39,499 --> 00:22:44,719
and interestingly and I really realized

582
00:22:42,649 --> 00:22:49,329
this only after I was doing the last

583
00:22:44,719 --> 00:22:52,579
three lectures so the Bible presents a

584
00:22:49,329 --> 00:22:53,989
cataclysm and okay a Cataclysm at the

585
00:22:52,579 --> 00:22:55,519
beginning of the top of Time which is

586
00:22:53,989 --> 00:22:57,289
the emergence of self-consciousness and

587
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:59,389
human beings which puts a rift into the

588
00:22:57,289 --> 00:23:00,769
structure of being that's the right way

589
00:22:59,389 --> 00:23:03,079
to think about it and that's really

590
00:23:00,769 --> 00:23:05,509
given cosmic significance now you can

591
00:23:03,079 --> 00:23:06,739
dispense with out and say well nothing

592
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:08,089
that happens to human beings does have

593
00:23:06,739 --> 00:23:10,779
caused me significance because we're

594
00:23:08,089 --> 00:23:13,369
these short-lived you know mold like

595
00:23:10,779 --> 00:23:15,349
entities that are like cancers on this

596
00:23:13,369 --> 00:23:17,239
tiny little planet that's rotating out

597
00:23:15,349 --> 00:23:19,609
in the middle of nowhere on the edge of

598
00:23:17,239 --> 00:23:21,529
some unknown galaxy in the middle of

599
00:23:19,609 --> 00:23:23,359
infinite space and nothing that happens

600
00:23:21,529 --> 00:23:24,859
to us matters and it's fine you like you

601
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:28,249
can walk down that road if you want I

602
00:23:24,859 --> 00:23:29,690
wouldn't recommend it I mean and that's

603
00:23:28,249 --> 00:23:32,629
part of the reason I think that for all

604
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:35,089
intents and purposes it's untrue you

605
00:23:32,629 --> 00:23:37,549
know it isn't it isn't a road you can

606
00:23:35,089 --> 00:23:39,169
walk down and live well in fact I think

607
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:40,519
if you really walk down that road and

608
00:23:39,169 --> 00:23:43,129
you really take it seriously you end up

609
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:44,719
not living at all so it's certainly very

610
00:23:43,129 --> 00:23:46,099
reminiscent I mean I've talked to lots

611
00:23:44,719 --> 00:23:48,679
of people who were suicidal and

612
00:23:46,099 --> 00:23:50,389
seriously suicidal and you know the kind

613
00:23:48,679 --> 00:23:52,789
of conclusions that they draw both the

614
00:23:50,389 --> 00:23:55,579
utility of life prior to wishing for its

615
00:23:52,789 --> 00:23:57,289
cessation are very much like the kind of

616
00:23:55,579 --> 00:23:58,639
conclusions that you draw if you walk

617
00:23:57,289 --> 00:24:00,559
down that particular line of reasoning

618
00:23:58,639 --> 00:24:02,329
long enough if you're interested in that

619
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:04,549
you could read Tolstoy his confessions

620
00:24:02,329 --> 00:24:06,679
Leo Tolstoy's confession it's a very

621
00:24:04,549 --> 00:24:08,809
short book it's a it's a killer man it's

622
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:12,469
it's a powerful book very very short and

623
00:24:08,809 --> 00:24:14,089
Tolstoy describes his obsession with

624
00:24:12,469 --> 00:24:16,729
suicide when he was at the height of his

625
00:24:14,089 --> 00:24:20,209
fame most well-known author in the world

626
00:24:16,729 --> 00:24:22,909
you know huge family international fame

627
00:24:20,209 --> 00:24:25,309
wealth beyond anyone's imagining at that

628
00:24:22,909 --> 00:24:26,809
time influential admired he

629
00:24:25,309 --> 00:24:28,399
everything that you could possibly

630
00:24:26,809 --> 00:24:30,769
imagine that everyone could have and for

631
00:24:28,399 --> 00:24:33,110
years he was afraid to go out into his

632
00:24:30,769 --> 00:24:34,340
barn with a rope or a gun because he

633
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:36,559
thought he'd either hang himself or

634
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:38,779
shoot himself and he did get out of that

635
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:41,200
he and he describes why that happened

636
00:24:38,779 --> 00:24:43,490
and where he went when that happened so

637
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:49,399
if you're interested in that that's a

638
00:24:43,490 --> 00:24:51,049
very good book but so the biblical

639
00:24:49,399 --> 00:24:53,590
stories and starting with Adam and Eve

640
00:24:51,049 --> 00:24:55,669
they present a different story

641
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:57,639
they present the emergence of

642
00:24:55,669 --> 00:25:00,740
self-consciousness in human beings as

643
00:24:57,639 --> 00:25:02,029
cosmically cataclysmic event and you

644
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:03,409
could say well what do we have to do

645
00:25:02,029 --> 00:25:04,669
with the cosmos and the answer to that

646
00:25:03,409 --> 00:25:06,350
is it depends on what you think

647
00:25:04,669 --> 00:25:08,389
consciousness has to do with the cosmos

648
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:10,669
and perhaps that's nothing and perhaps

649
00:25:08,389 --> 00:25:12,080
it's everything I'm going to go with

650
00:25:10,669 --> 00:25:15,139
everything because that's how it looks

651
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:17,179
to me now of course anyone who wishes to

652
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:19,249
is welcome to disagree but if you

653
00:25:17,179 --> 00:25:21,889
believe that consciousness is a force of

654
00:25:19,249 --> 00:25:24,259
cosmic significance which Britt which

655
00:25:21,889 --> 00:25:25,610
which being itself is dependent on in

656
00:25:24,259 --> 00:25:27,230
any real sense at least in any

657
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:29,649
experience will sense that it's that

658
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:32,269
it's not unreasonable to assume that

659
00:25:29,649 --> 00:25:35,659
radical restructurings of consciousness

660
00:25:32,269 --> 00:25:38,570
can worthily be granted some kind of

661
00:25:35,659 --> 00:25:41,690
cosmic or metaphysical significance and

662
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:43,399
even if it's not true from outside the

663
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:45,169
human perspective whatever that might be

664
00:25:43,399 --> 00:25:47,299
it's bloody well true from within the

665
00:25:45,169 --> 00:25:49,879
human perspective that's for sure and so

666
00:25:47,299 --> 00:25:51,499
that's the that's the initial event in

667
00:25:49,879 --> 00:25:53,059
some sense after the creation is the

668
00:25:51,499 --> 00:25:54,619
cataclysmic fall and then the entire

669
00:25:53,059 --> 00:25:55,669
rest of the Bible is an attempt to

670
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:59,240
figure out what the hell to do about

671
00:25:55,669 --> 00:26:00,830
that and everything in it is is and so

672
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:02,960
you could say for example in the

673
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:04,999
earliest in the Old Testament stories

674
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:08,690
what seems to happen is that the State

675
00:26:04,999 --> 00:26:10,639
of Israel is is founded and it rises and

676
00:26:08,690 --> 00:26:13,580
falls and rises and falls and so there's

677
00:26:10,639 --> 00:26:16,639
this experimentation for centuries

678
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:18,139
millennia even with the idea that the

679
00:26:16,639 --> 00:26:19,610
way that you protect yourself against

680
00:26:18,139 --> 00:26:21,169
the tragic consequences of self

681
00:26:19,610 --> 00:26:23,869
consciousness is by organizing yourself

682
00:26:21,169 --> 00:26:26,090
into a state but then what happens is

683
00:26:23,869 --> 00:26:28,460
the state itself begins to reveal its

684
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:30,799
pathologies and as those pathologies

685
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:34,490
mount the state becomes an unstable and

686
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:36,259
collapses and then it rises back up and

687
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:38,600
becomes unstable and collapses and then

688
00:26:36,259 --> 00:26:39,140
it rises back up after it does this a

689
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,760
number of

690
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:43,010
times.this is primarily from Northrup

691
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:44,330
fries interpretations people start

692
00:26:43,010 --> 00:26:46,520
wondering if there's not something wrong

693
00:26:44,330 --> 00:26:49,970
with the idea that the state itself is

694
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:51,650
this is the is the pathway is the place

695
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:54,440
of redemption that there's something

696
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:57,320
wrong with that idea and so then I think

697
00:26:54,440 --> 00:27:00,680
on on the heels of that comes the

698
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:03,170
Christian revolution with its hypothesis

699
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:04,790
that it's not the state that's that's

700
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:08,480
the place of salvation it's the

701
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:11,360
individual psyche and then there's

702
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,650
there's a there's a an ethic that goes

703
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:17,110
along with that too which is quite

704
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:20,690
interesting so the ethic of redemption

705
00:27:17,110 --> 00:27:24,410
after the state experiment fails let's

706
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:27,020
say is that it's it's the it's within

707
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:29,570
the individual that Redemption can be

708
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:30,950
manifested let's say and even insofar as

709
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:32,990
the state is concerned because the

710
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:34,310
state's proper functioning is dependent

711
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:36,620
on the proper functioning of the

712
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:38,720
individual rather than the reverse most

713
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:40,700
fundamentally and that the proper mode

714
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:43,730
of individual being that's redemptive is

715
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:47,240
truth and truth is the antidote to the

716
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:49,730
suffering that's that emerges with the

717
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:51,740
fall of man in the story of Adam and Eve

718
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:52,970
and then that relates back to the

719
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:55,720
chapters that we've already talked about

720
00:27:52,970 --> 00:28:00,590
because there's this insistence in

721
00:27:55,720 --> 00:28:02,750
Genesis 1 that it's the word in the form

722
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:04,580
of the of truth that generates order out

723
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:05,870
of chaos but even more importantly and

724
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:07,040
this is something like I said I most

725
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:09,230
clearly realize just doing these

726
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:12,260
lectures for the last three weeks is God

727
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:14,600
continues to say as he speaks order into

728
00:28:12,260 --> 00:28:17,510
being with truth that the being he

729
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:20,060
speaks into being is good and so there's

730
00:28:17,510 --> 00:28:22,130
this insistence that the being that

731
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:24,320
spoke into being through truth is good

732
00:28:22,130 --> 00:28:26,180
and so there's a hint there it's so

733
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:29,300
interesting there's a hint there right

734
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:33,010
at the beginning of the story that the

735
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:35,930
the state of being that Adam and Eve

736
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:38,000
inhabited before they fell before they

737
00:28:35,930 --> 00:28:40,160
became self consciousness conscious

738
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,710
insofar as they were made in the image

739
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:45,260
of God and acting out the truth that

740
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:47,510
that being itself was properly balanced

741
00:28:45,260 --> 00:28:49,610
and it takes the entire Bible to

742
00:28:47,510 --> 00:28:51,950
rediscover that which is a which is a

743
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:53,090
journey back to the beginning right and

744
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:54,999
that's a classic theme

745
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:57,799
it's a classic mythological theme that

746
00:28:54,999 --> 00:28:59,749
the wise person is the person who finds

747
00:28:57,799 --> 00:29:03,679
what they lost in childhood and regains

748
00:28:59,749 --> 00:29:05,720
it right so that's a I think that's a

749
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:07,940
Jewish idea this is addict if I remember

750
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:10,190
correctly who is a messiah figure is the

751
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:11,749
person who finds what he lost in

752
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:13,909
childhood and regains it his idea of

753
00:29:11,749 --> 00:29:15,830
this return to the beginning except that

754
00:29:13,909 --> 00:29:19,039
the return is you don't fall backwards

755
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:21,370
into childhood and unconsciousness you

756
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:22,580
returned voluntarily to the state of

757
00:29:21,370 --> 00:29:25,309
childhood

758
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:26,869
well awake and then determined to

759
00:29:25,309 --> 00:29:30,590
participate through truth in the

760
00:29:26,869 --> 00:29:32,570
manifestation of proper being now you

761
00:29:30,590 --> 00:29:34,279
know I'm a psychologist and I've taught

762
00:29:32,570 --> 00:29:36,619
personality theory for a very long time

763
00:29:34,279 --> 00:29:38,059
and I know personality theory is that

764
00:29:36,619 --> 00:29:40,009
profound personality theory is pretty

765
00:29:38,059 --> 00:29:41,899
well and I'm reasonably well versed in

766
00:29:40,009 --> 00:29:43,820
philosophy although not as well-versed

767
00:29:41,899 --> 00:29:45,769
as I should be but I can tell you and

768
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:47,179
all the things I've ever read or

769
00:29:45,769 --> 00:29:49,789
encountered or thought about I have

770
00:29:47,179 --> 00:29:51,980
never once found an idea that matches

771
00:29:49,789 --> 00:29:54,559
that in terms of profundity but not only

772
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:56,179
profundity also in believability because

773
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:58,009
the other thing I see is a clinician and

774
00:29:56,179 --> 00:30:01,240
I think this is a very characteristic of

775
00:29:58,009 --> 00:30:03,619
clinical experience and also very much

776
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:06,499
described explicitly by the great

777
00:30:03,619 --> 00:30:09,889
clinicians is that what cures in therapy

778
00:30:06,499 --> 00:30:11,509
is truth that's the curative now there's

779
00:30:09,889 --> 00:30:13,340
exposure to the things you're afraid of

780
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:15,019
and avoiding as well but I would say

781
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:16,249
that's a form of enacted truth because

782
00:30:15,019 --> 00:30:19,460
if you know there's something you should

783
00:30:16,249 --> 00:30:21,169
do by your own set of rules and you're

784
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:22,700
avoiding it then you're enacting a lot

785
00:30:21,169 --> 00:30:24,049
you know you're not telling one but

786
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:27,860
you're acting one out it's the same damn

787
00:30:24,049 --> 00:30:29,269
thing so if I can get you to face what

788
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:30,799
it is that you're confronting that you

789
00:30:29,269 --> 00:30:32,600
know you shouldn't be avoiding then

790
00:30:30,799 --> 00:30:34,940
what's happening is that we're both

791
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:37,070
partaking in the process of attempting

792
00:30:34,940 --> 00:30:38,600
you to act out your deepest truth and

793
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:40,460
what happens is that that improves

794
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,990
people's lives and it improves them

795
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:43,039
radically and the evidence of the

796
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:45,470
clinical evidence for that is

797
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:46,820
overwhelming we know that if you expose

798
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:48,470
people to the things they're afraid of

799
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:50,090
but that they're avoiding they get

800
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:51,759
better and you have to do it carefully

801
00:30:50,090 --> 00:30:54,830
and cautiously and with their own

802
00:30:51,759 --> 00:30:56,240
participation in all of that but of all

803
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:58,070
the things that clinicians have

804
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,080
established that's credible that's

805
00:30:58,070 --> 00:31:02,509
number one and that's nested inside this

806
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:05,119
deeper realization that the clinical

807
00:31:02,509 --> 00:31:05,720
experience is redemptive let's say

808
00:31:05,119 --> 00:31:07,279
because it

809
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:09,440
it's designed to address suffering

810
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:11,059
insofar as the people who are engaged in

811
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,620
the process are both telling each other

812
00:31:11,059 --> 00:31:14,809
the truth and then you think well

813
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:16,940
obviously because if if you have some

814
00:31:14,809 --> 00:31:18,799
problems and you come to talk to me

815
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:20,029
about them well first of all just by

816
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:21,799
coming to talk to me about them you've

817
00:31:20,029 --> 00:31:24,500
admitted that they exist now and that's

818
00:31:21,799 --> 00:31:26,149
a pretty good start and second well if

819
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:28,100
you tell me about them then we know what

820
00:31:26,149 --> 00:31:30,470
they are and then if we know what they

821
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:32,029
are we can maybe start to lay out some

822
00:31:30,470 --> 00:31:33,860
solutions and then you can go act out

823
00:31:32,029 --> 00:31:35,629
the solutions and see if they work but

824
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:37,460
if you don't admit they're there and you

825
00:31:35,629 --> 00:31:40,129
won't tell me what they are and I don't

826
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:42,169
and I'm like posturing and and and

827
00:31:40,129 --> 00:31:43,279
acting egotistically and and taking the

828
00:31:42,169 --> 00:31:44,840
upper hand and all of that in our

829
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:46,820
discussions well how the hell is that

830
00:31:44,840 --> 00:31:48,620
going to work you know it might be

831
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:50,629
comfortable moment to moment while we

832
00:31:48,620 --> 00:31:52,820
stay encapsulated in our delusion but

833
00:31:50,629 --> 00:31:54,860
it's not going to work so a lot of that

834
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:57,740
seems if you think it through it seems

835
00:31:54,860 --> 00:32:00,080
pretty self-evident and you know Freud

836
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:02,389
thought that repression was at the heart

837
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:04,340
of much mental suffering the difference

838
00:32:02,389 --> 00:32:07,250
between repression and deception is a

839
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:08,690
matter of degree and that's all its

840
00:32:07,250 --> 00:32:11,299
technical it's a technical

841
00:32:08,690 --> 00:32:14,240
differentiation and Alfred Adler who was

842
00:32:11,299 --> 00:32:16,669
one of Freud's greatest associates say

843
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,929
and much underappreciated I would say he

844
00:32:16,669 --> 00:32:19,879
thought that people got into problems

845
00:32:17,929 --> 00:32:21,799
because they started to act out a life

846
00:32:19,879 --> 00:32:23,269
lie that's what he called it a life lie

847
00:32:21,799 --> 00:32:25,070
that's worth looking up because I have

848
00:32:23,269 --> 00:32:27,379
there although not as charismatic as

849
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:30,110
Freud was very practical and and and

850
00:32:27,379 --> 00:32:31,789
really foreshadowed a lot of later

851
00:32:30,110 --> 00:32:33,950
developments in cybernetic theory and of

852
00:32:31,789 --> 00:32:37,070
course you believed that you could

853
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:39,350
bypass psychotherapy entirely by merely

854
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:41,659
making a proper moral effort in your own

855
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:44,480
life and Carl Rogers believed that it

856
00:32:41,659 --> 00:32:46,399
was honest communication mediated

857
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:48,440
through dialogue that had redemptive

858
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:50,840
consequences and the behaviors believe

859
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:52,370
that you do a careful micro analysis of

860
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:54,110
the problems that are laid before you

861
00:32:52,370 --> 00:32:56,330
and help introduce people to what

862
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:58,580
they're avoiding it's like all of those

863
00:32:56,330 --> 00:33:00,710
things to me are just secular variations

864
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:05,299
of the notion that truth will set you

865
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:10,580
free essentially so so you know it's a

866
00:33:05,299 --> 00:33:12,950
pretty powerful story and a it's not

867
00:33:10,580 --> 00:33:14,509
that easy to dispense with and B the

868
00:33:12,950 --> 00:33:16,250
other thing is you dispense with it at

869
00:33:14,509 --> 00:33:19,159
your peril because what I have seen as

870
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:20,290
well is that the people that I've seen

871
00:33:19,159 --> 00:33:22,990
who've been

872
00:33:20,290 --> 00:33:24,580
have been hurt mostly by deceit and

873
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:26,650
that's also worth thinking about that

874
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:28,660
you know you get walloped by life

875
00:33:26,650 --> 00:33:31,360
there's no doubt about that absolutely

876
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:33,130
no doubt about that but I've thought for

877
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:36,130
a long time that maybe maybe maybe

878
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:38,830
people can hang handle earthquakes and

879
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:41,500
cancer and even death Meany

880
00:33:38,830 --> 00:33:44,230
but they can't handle betrayal and they

881
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:45,370
can't handle deception they can't handle

882
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:46,990
having the rug pulled out from

883
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:49,870
underneath and by people that they love

884
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:52,750
and trust that just does them in you

885
00:33:49,870 --> 00:33:55,030
know it it it it makes the meal but it

886
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:57,010
does where it hurts them you know psycho

887
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:58,570
physiologically it damages them but more

888
00:33:57,010 --> 00:34:00,640
than that it makes them cynical and

889
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:02,950
bitter and vicious and resentful and

890
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:06,750
then they also start to act all that out

891
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:06,750
in the world and that makes it worse so

892
00:34:06,810 --> 00:34:13,480
so you know this story starts god uses

893
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:17,020
the spoken truth to create being that is

894
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:20,980
good and then the Cataclysm occurs and

895
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:23,110
then human beings spend until millennia

896
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:25,000
trying to sort out exactly what to do

897
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:27,220
about the fact that they've become self

898
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:30,010
conscious and you know by the way we

899
00:34:27,220 --> 00:34:32,350
have right we are in fact self conscious

900
00:34:30,010 --> 00:34:34,960
no other animal has that distinction

901
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:37,270
now you'll read that chimpanzees can for

902
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:40,240
example if you put lipstick on a

903
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:46,720
chimpanzee it's kind of a strange thing

904
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:50,530
to do yeah well I won't pursue that any

905
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:52,330
further but the chimp a chimpanzee will

906
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:55,360
wipe off the lipstick if you show it a

907
00:34:52,330 --> 00:34:57,370
mirror and dolphins seem to be able to

908
00:34:55,360 --> 00:35:00,070
recognize themselves in mirrors and

909
00:34:57,370 --> 00:35:01,720
there is so there is the glimmerings of

910
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:04,480
self conscious recognition and other

911
00:35:01,720 --> 00:35:05,950
animals but to put that in the same

912
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:08,710
conceptual category as human

913
00:35:05,950 --> 00:35:14,710
self-consciousness is to my way of

914
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:16,060
thinking it's it's well it's uninformed

915
00:35:14,710 --> 00:35:18,310
to say the least but I also think that

916
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:21,220
it's motivated it's motivated by a kind

917
00:35:18,310 --> 00:35:23,800
of anti humanistic underlying an

918
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:26,170
underlying motivation because our

919
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:27,670
self-consciousness is so incredibly

920
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:29,260
developed compared to that that they're

921
00:35:27,670 --> 00:35:33,040
hardly in the same conceptual universe

922
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:33,700
it's it's like comparing the the alarm

923
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:35,560
cries of

924
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:37,390
vervet monkeys when they see a predator

925
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:38,859
to the language of human beings it's

926
00:35:37,390 --> 00:35:41,050
like yeah yeah yeah there's some

927
00:35:38,859 --> 00:35:42,940
similarities man there are other iNSYS

928
00:35:41,050 --> 00:35:43,930
and there are other insisting but

929
00:35:42,940 --> 00:35:45,849
they're not language and the

930
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:47,530
self-consciousness of animals is proto

931
00:35:45,849 --> 00:35:49,450
self-consciousness and it's only there

932
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:51,760
in a very small number of animals and

933
00:35:49,450 --> 00:35:53,440
it's it's nothing like ours they're not

934
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:55,510
aware of the future like we are they're

935
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:57,640
not aware of their boundaries in space

936
00:35:55,510 --> 00:36:00,690
and time and that's the critical thing

937
00:35:57,640 --> 00:36:03,730
and most particularly time human beings

938
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:06,099
discovered time and when we discover

939
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:08,410
time we discovered the end of each of

940
00:36:06,099 --> 00:36:10,240
our being and that made all the

941
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:15,190
difference and that's what the story of

942
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:17,140
Adam and Eve is about so genesis ones

943
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:20,020
derived from the priestly source where

944
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:22,990
God is known as Elohim or El Shaddai

945
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:25,720
and there's God in the singular and

946
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:27,640
there's gods in the plural and I suppose

947
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:30,099
that's because it seems that if you

948
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:32,650
analyze the history of the development

949
00:36:30,099 --> 00:36:35,380
of monotheistic ideas that monotheism

950
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:37,960
emerges out of a plurality of gods and

951
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:40,540
as I mentioned I think it's because the

952
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:42,099
gods represent fundamental forces at

953
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:44,560
minimum and those fundamental forces

954
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:47,890
have to be hierarchy to be organized for

955
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:49,150
with some with something absolute at the

956
00:36:47,890 --> 00:36:51,609
top because otherwise they do nothing

957
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:53,440
but war like you have to organize your

958
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:55,180
values hierarchically or you stay

959
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:57,190
confused and that's true if you're an

960
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:59,200
individual and it it's true if you're a

961
00:36:57,190 --> 00:37:01,780
state if you don't know what the next

962
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:03,460
thing you should do is then there's 50

963
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:04,900
things you should do and then how are

964
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:06,880
you gonna do any of them you can't you

965
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:08,740
have to prioritize something has to be

966
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,390
above something else it has to be

967
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:12,310
arranged in a hierarchy for it not to be

968
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:14,109
chaotic and so there's some principle at

969
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:15,970
the top of the hierarchy and maybe the

970
00:37:14,109 --> 00:37:17,980
organization of the gods over time

971
00:37:15,970 --> 00:37:19,329
that's the battle of gods that Mircea

972
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:20,800
Eliade i talked about and if you're

973
00:37:19,329 --> 00:37:23,170
interested in that you could read a

974
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:24,550
history of religious ideas which I would

975
00:37:23,170 --> 00:37:27,040
really recommend it's a three-volume

976
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:28,660
book it's actually quite as

977
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:30,460
straightforward read as far as these

978
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:33,810
things go and Elliott it does a very

979
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:37,030
nice job of describing how and even why

980
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:39,640
polytheism tends towards monotheism even

981
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:41,890
in polytheistic cultures there's a

982
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:43,450
strong tendency for the gods to organize

983
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:46,060
themselves in a hierarchy with one God

984
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:47,710
at the top in a monotheistic culture and

985
00:37:46,060 --> 00:37:48,940
some in some sense all the other gods

986
00:37:47,710 --> 00:37:51,339
disappear across time and there's

987
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:52,780
nothing left but the top god but even in

988
00:37:51,339 --> 00:37:56,589
a polytheistic society there's a

989
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:58,839
hierarchy of power among the gods the

990
00:37:56,589 --> 00:38:00,280
first story is newer than the second one

991
00:37:58,839 --> 00:38:01,720
so the story I'm going to tell you today

992
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:04,420
is actually older than the one I already

993
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:06,520
told you even though their order was

994
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:08,200
flipped by the redactor who's the

995
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:10,240
hypothetical person or persons who

996
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:11,920
edited these stories together and we

997
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:13,480
don't know exactly why he or the

998
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:15,550
committee or what I suspect it was a

999
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:18,010
single person but who knows we don't

1000
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:20,290
know why the stories were edited

1001
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:23,650
together in the order that they were

1002
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:25,450
added together but we could infer I mean

1003
00:38:23,650 --> 00:38:26,980
they were added together in that order

1004
00:38:25,450 --> 00:38:28,809
because the editor thought they made

1005
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:30,579
sense that way because that's what an

1006
00:38:28,809 --> 00:38:33,400
editor does right an editor tends to

1007
00:38:30,579 --> 00:38:35,589
take diverse ideas and then to organize

1008
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:37,510
them in some manner that makes sense and

1009
00:38:35,589 --> 00:38:39,430
part of the manner that makes sense is

1010
00:38:37,510 --> 00:38:41,410
that you can tell them to people and the

1011
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:43,660
people stay interested and you can tell

1012
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:45,609
them to people and people remember them

1013
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:46,990
that's that's one of the ways you can

1014
00:38:45,609 --> 00:38:48,849
tell if you've got an argument right

1015
00:38:46,990 --> 00:38:51,640
because it's communicable and

1016
00:38:48,849 --> 00:38:55,059
understandable and memorable and so he

1017
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:56,890
this person was let's say motivated by

1018
00:38:55,059 --> 00:39:01,180
intuition to organize the stories in

1019
00:38:56,890 --> 00:39:05,079
this particular manner so the second the

1020
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:06,730
yahwist strand contains the stories the

1021
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:08,440
classic stories in the Pentateuch that's

1022
00:39:06,730 --> 00:39:11,410
five books Genesis Exodus Leviticus

1023
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:13,450
numbers and Deuteronomy which we'll try

1024
00:39:11,410 --> 00:39:14,799
to get through perhaps in these twelve

1025
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:17,230
lectures with Steve we'll see how that

1026
00:39:14,799 --> 00:39:19,270
goes it's strongly under for Norfolk so

1027
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:20,829
the God in the August account is for all

1028
00:39:19,270 --> 00:39:24,099
intents and purposes a sort of meta

1029
00:39:20,829 --> 00:39:26,859
person and I dealt with that a little

1030
00:39:24,099 --> 00:39:28,059
bit last week because people tend to you

1031
00:39:26,859 --> 00:39:31,540
know think of that as unsophisticated

1032
00:39:28,059 --> 00:39:34,750
but when you think that the mind that

1033
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:37,510
the the ground of consciousness is the

1034
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:39,220
most complex thing that we know of then

1035
00:39:37,510 --> 00:39:40,990
it's not so unsophisticated to assume

1036
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:42,700
that the most complex thing that there

1037
00:39:40,990 --> 00:39:43,869
might be is like that or it's at least

1038
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:46,270
it's as good as we can do with our

1039
00:39:43,869 --> 00:39:51,490
imaginations and so I don't think it's

1040
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:53,920
so it's so it's so unsophisticated it's

1041
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:55,329
also the case and this is practically

1042
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:58,089
speaking is that it is not at all

1043
00:39:55,329 --> 00:40:01,420
unreasonable to think of God the Father

1044
00:39:58,089 --> 00:40:03,880
as the spirit that arises from the cry

1045
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:04,930
that exists into the future right and

1046
00:40:03,880 --> 00:40:06,790
that's we talked about that in

1047
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:08,350
relationship to the idea of sacrifice at

1048
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:10,930
least a little bit tomorrow or we're

1049
00:40:08,350 --> 00:40:12,760
going to you make sacrifices in the

1050
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:15,070
present so that the future is happy with

1051
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:17,110
you and the question is what is that

1052
00:40:15,070 --> 00:40:19,650
future that would be happy with you and

1053
00:40:17,110 --> 00:40:21,730
the answer to that is it's the spirit of

1054
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:23,110
humanity that's that's who you're

1055
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:26,110
negotiating with because you make the

1056
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:27,430
assumption that if you forego impulsive

1057
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:30,130
pleasure and get your medical degree

1058
00:40:27,430 --> 00:40:34,120
that when you're done in ten years and

1059
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:36,610
you're a physician humanity as such will

1060
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:38,740
honor your sacrifice and commitment and

1061
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:40,660
open the doors to you right so you're

1062
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:42,490
treating the future as if it's a single

1063
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:44,920
being and you're also treating it as if

1064
00:40:42,490 --> 00:40:47,350
it's a something like a compassionate

1065
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:49,960
judge you're acting that out and maybe

1066
00:40:47,350 --> 00:40:53,200
we had to imagine God in that form

1067
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:54,790
before we could understand once we

1068
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,830
started to understand that there was a

1069
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:58,780
future perhaps we had to imagine God in

1070
00:40:56,830 --> 00:41:00,820
that form in order to concretize

1071
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:01,900
something that we could bargain with so

1072
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:03,490
that we could figure out how to use

1073
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:05,380
sacrifice to figure out how to guide

1074
00:41:03,490 --> 00:41:07,300
ourselves into the future because I

1075
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:08,920
sacrifice as a contract with the future

1076
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:10,990
but it's not a contract with any

1077
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:13,450
particular person it's it's a contract

1078
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:15,400
with the spirit of humanity as such it's

1079
00:41:13,450 --> 00:41:17,260
something like that and so when you

1080
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:19,420
think about it that way that should make

1081
00:41:17,260 --> 00:41:21,490
you faint with amazement because that is

1082
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:23,230
such a bloody amazing idea to come up

1083
00:41:21,490 --> 00:41:25,810
with that idea that you can bargain with

1084
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:28,030
the future that is some idea man

1085
00:41:25,810 --> 00:41:31,030
that's that's like the major idea of

1086
00:41:28,030 --> 00:41:32,620
human of humankind we suffer what do we

1087
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:34,570
do about it we figure out how to bargain

1088
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:36,850
with the future and we minimize

1089
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:38,260
suffering in that manner it's like no

1090
00:41:36,850 --> 00:41:39,820
other animal does that either you know

1091
00:41:38,260 --> 00:41:41,920
like the Lions they just eat everything

1092
00:41:39,820 --> 00:41:44,170
I think a wolf can eat forty pounds of

1093
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:45,760
meat in a single sitting right it's like

1094
00:41:44,170 --> 00:41:48,120
there's some meat eat it it's light not

1095
00:41:45,760 --> 00:41:51,250
like save some mammoths for tomorrow

1096
00:41:48,120 --> 00:41:53,230
that's a that's that's not a wolf thing

1097
00:41:51,250 --> 00:41:54,550
man that's a human thing and that might

1098
00:41:53,230 --> 00:41:56,110
mean you have to be hungry today

1099
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:58,420
or maybe you're a farmer you know

1100
00:41:56,110 --> 00:41:59,920
several thousand years ago six thousand

1101
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:01,330
years ago or so what agriculture first

1102
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:03,700
got going and you're starving to death

1103
00:42:01,330 --> 00:42:05,110
waiting for the spring planting and you

1104
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:07,750
think we bill it bloody well better not

1105
00:42:05,110 --> 00:42:09,250
eat those seeds right and that's really

1106
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:12,700
something to be able to control yourself

1107
00:42:09,250 --> 00:42:14,680
to make the future real to put off what

1108
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:15,099
you could use today and not just in some

1109
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:16,539
and Paul

1110
00:42:15,099 --> 00:42:18,519
of manner man maybe your kids are

1111
00:42:16,539 --> 00:42:20,920
starving to death you think we are not

1112
00:42:18,519 --> 00:42:22,930
touching the seeds that we need for the

1113
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:24,519
future and for human beings to have

1114
00:42:22,930 --> 00:42:25,839
discovered that and then to also have

1115
00:42:24,519 --> 00:42:27,160
figured out that we could bargain with

1116
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:29,319
the future it's like man

1117
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:30,849
that's something and I think that that I

1118
00:42:29,319 --> 00:42:32,529
think that the stories that are laid out

1119
00:42:30,849 --> 00:42:34,089
in this book actually describe at least

1120
00:42:32,529 --> 00:42:37,960
in part the process by which that

1121
00:42:34,089 --> 00:42:40,450
occurred the always stories begin with

1122
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:41,979
Genesis 2:4 this is the account of the

1123
00:42:40,450 --> 00:42:43,660
heavens and the earth wind so there's

1124
00:42:41,979 --> 00:42:45,670
two real creation stories at the

1125
00:42:43,660 --> 00:42:47,229
beginning the newer one which is the

1126
00:42:45,670 --> 00:42:49,420
first one and the older one which is the

1127
00:42:47,229 --> 00:42:51,130
second one and the older one begins in

1128
00:42:49,420 --> 00:42:52,839
Chapter two and that's the story that

1129
00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:55,839
we're going to that we are getting into

1130
00:42:52,839 --> 00:42:59,289
now Adam and Eve are in that Cain and

1131
00:42:55,839 --> 00:43:01,599
Abel knoweth the Tower of Babel in the

1132
00:42:59,289 --> 00:43:03,039
August strand Exodus numbers along and

1133
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:04,029
there's some of the priestly version in

1134
00:43:03,039 --> 00:43:07,479
there too as well as the Ten

1135
00:43:04,029 --> 00:43:13,650
Commandments well there's some lovely

1136
00:43:07,479 --> 00:43:15,880
representations of of paradise this is

1137
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:20,079
Garden of Earthly Delights what's his

1138
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:23,769
name say that oh yes Hieronymous Bosch

1139
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:25,210
he has a crazy I mean if you how he

1140
00:43:23,769 --> 00:43:27,880
didn't get burnt at the stake is

1141
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:29,619
absolutely beyond me I mean you know

1142
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:31,599
some of you know about salvador deli i

1143
00:43:29,619 --> 00:43:33,549
suppose most of you do I mean delis a

1144
00:43:31,599 --> 00:43:36,219
[ __ ] compared to Hieronymous Bosch man

1145
00:43:33,549 --> 00:43:39,069
you could spend because there's three

1146
00:43:36,219 --> 00:43:43,420
pieces of this particular painting you

1147
00:43:39,069 --> 00:43:45,940
could spend a very bizarre and surreal

1148
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:47,469
month looking at that painting I don't

1149
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:49,630
know what it was with Bosch but he was

1150
00:43:47,469 --> 00:43:55,450
some sort of creature that only popped

1151
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:57,160
up once and probably for the best and so

1152
00:43:55,450 --> 00:43:58,839
there's been very many representations

1153
00:43:57,160 --> 00:44:03,160
of paradise maybe god only knows what

1154
00:43:58,839 --> 00:44:04,140
that is it's like I could probably guess

1155
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:06,789
but I won't

1156
00:44:04,140 --> 00:44:08,799
and then look I mean that's that's

1157
00:44:06,789 --> 00:44:10,869
that's the lion lying down with the lamb

1158
00:44:08,799 --> 00:44:12,759
right so that's this idea that's it's

1159
00:44:10,869 --> 00:44:14,680
maybe projected back in time that there

1160
00:44:12,759 --> 00:44:17,619
was a time or maybe will be a time when

1161
00:44:14,680 --> 00:44:19,630
when that then the horrors of life are

1162
00:44:17,619 --> 00:44:23,499
no longer necessary for life itself to

1163
00:44:19,630 --> 00:44:24,609
exist right and the horrors of life are

1164
00:44:23,499 --> 00:44:26,200
of course that everything eats

1165
00:44:24,609 --> 00:44:27,819
everything else and that everything dies

1166
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:28,990
and that everything's born and that the

1167
00:44:27,819 --> 00:44:30,640
whole bloody place is at

1168
00:44:28,990 --> 00:44:33,369
Arnel house and it's it's a catastrophe

1169
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:35,560
from beginning to end and this is this

1170
00:44:33,369 --> 00:44:38,470
is the vision of it being other than

1171
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:40,750
that and you know there's a strong idea

1172
00:44:38,470 --> 00:44:42,250
this is also in implicit in the

1173
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:44,680
alchemical ideas and I think it's also

1174
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:48,550
implicit in the Scientific Revolution

1175
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:50,710
that human beings can interact with

1176
00:44:48,550 --> 00:44:52,540
reality in such a way so that the tragic

1177
00:44:50,710 --> 00:44:55,000
and evil elements of it can be mitigated

1178
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:57,160
and so that we can move somewhat closer

1179
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:59,320
to a state that might be characterized

1180
00:44:57,160 --> 00:45:00,730
that's obviously imagistic but it might

1181
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:02,470
be characterized by something like that

1182
00:45:00,730 --> 00:45:04,900
where we have the benefits of actual

1183
00:45:02,470 --> 00:45:06,790
existence without all of the catastrophe

1184
00:45:04,900 --> 00:45:08,740
that seems to go along with it and Carl

1185
00:45:06,790 --> 00:45:10,630
Jung when he wrote about the emergence

1186
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:12,520
of alchemy or the emergence of science

1187
00:45:10,630 --> 00:45:14,740
from alchemy he thought of science as

1188
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:16,900
being motivated by a dream because for

1189
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:18,670
Jung dream was the dream was the

1190
00:45:16,900 --> 00:45:20,260
manifestation of the instincts it was

1191
00:45:18,670 --> 00:45:22,450
the boundary between the instincts and

1192
00:45:20,260 --> 00:45:24,730
thinking said well science is nested

1193
00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:26,110
inside a dream and the dream is that if

1194
00:45:24,730 --> 00:45:27,760
we investigated the structures of

1195
00:45:26,110 --> 00:45:30,160
material reality with sufficient

1196
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:32,290
attention and truth that we could then

1197
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:34,630
learn enough about material reality to

1198
00:45:32,290 --> 00:45:36,400
alleviate suffering right to produce the

1199
00:45:34,630 --> 00:45:38,320
Philosopher's Stone to make everybody

1200
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:40,180
wealthy to make everybody healthy to

1201
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:42,040
make everyone live as long as they

1202
00:45:40,180 --> 00:45:44,050
wanted to live for perhaps forever that

1203
00:45:42,040 --> 00:45:46,119
that's the goal to alleviate the

1204
00:45:44,050 --> 00:45:49,180
catastrophe of existence and that that

1205
00:45:46,119 --> 00:45:51,880
idea the idea that mysteries the

1206
00:45:49,180 --> 00:45:53,530
solution to the mysteries of life that

1207
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:55,390
might enable us to develop such a

1208
00:45:53,530 --> 00:45:57,910
substance or let's say a multitude of

1209
00:45:55,390 --> 00:45:59,950
substances provided the motive force for

1210
00:45:57,910 --> 00:46:01,869
the development of science and young

1211
00:45:59,950 --> 00:46:03,460
trace that the development of that mode

1212
00:46:01,869 --> 00:46:05,260
of force really over a thousand years

1213
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:06,400
and if you're interested in reading his

1214
00:46:05,260 --> 00:46:07,750
books on alchemy which are

1215
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,100
extraordinarily difficult and that's

1216
00:46:07,750 --> 00:46:10,720
really saying something about young

1217
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:12,820
because all of his books are difficult

1218
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:14,920
and then the books on alchemy they kind

1219
00:46:12,820 --> 00:46:16,600
of take a quantum leap that's actually a

1220
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:19,270
very small leap so I shouldn't say that

1221
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:20,950
they take a massive leap into a whole

1222
00:46:19,270 --> 00:46:22,180
different dimension of complexity but

1223
00:46:20,950 --> 00:46:24,310
that's what he was trying to get at he

1224
00:46:22,180 --> 00:46:26,140
went back into the alchemical texts and

1225
00:46:24,310 --> 00:46:28,090
interpreted them as if they were the

1226
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:29,890
dream on which science was founded

1227
00:46:28,090 --> 00:46:32,500
Newton was an alchemist by the way I

1228
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:35,590
mean Jung's hypotheses are certainly

1229
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:37,420
well supported by the historical fact

1230
00:46:35,590 --> 00:46:39,369
science did emerge out of alchemy the

1231
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:40,720
question is what were the alchemists up

1232
00:46:39,369 --> 00:46:42,250
to and they were trying to produce the

1233
00:46:40,720 --> 00:46:42,430
Philosopher's Stone and that was the you

1234
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:44,950
know

1235
00:46:42,430 --> 00:46:46,779
so medica meant for mankind's pathology

1236
00:46:44,950 --> 00:46:48,910
Jung felt that what had happened was

1237
00:46:46,779 --> 00:46:50,799
that you know Christianity had promised

1238
00:46:48,910 --> 00:46:52,240
that the cessation of suffering promised

1239
00:46:50,799 --> 00:46:55,029
it for a thousand years and yet

1240
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:57,190
suffering went on unabated and at the

1241
00:46:55,029 --> 00:46:58,839
same time Christianity had attempted to

1242
00:46:57,190 --> 00:47:00,849
really put emphasis on spiritual

1243
00:46:58,839 --> 00:47:03,099
development let's say at the expense of

1244
00:47:00,849 --> 00:47:04,660
material development right thinking of

1245
00:47:03,099 --> 00:47:07,119
material development as something akin

1246
00:47:04,660 --> 00:47:08,980
to a sin trying to get a control of

1247
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:11,079
impulsivity and and all the things that

1248
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:14,650
went along with a to embodied existence

1249
00:47:11,079 --> 00:47:17,579
there was a reason for it but that by

1250
00:47:14,650 --> 00:47:20,500
about a thousand AD the European mind

1251
00:47:17,579 --> 00:47:22,270
somewhat educated by that point someone

1252
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:24,789
able to concentrate on a single point

1253
00:47:22,270 --> 00:47:27,490
perhaps because of a very long history

1254
00:47:24,789 --> 00:47:31,059
of intense religious training turned its

1255
00:47:27,490 --> 00:47:33,250
dream to the unexplored material world

1256
00:47:31,059 --> 00:47:34,510
and thought well you know the spiritual

1257
00:47:33,250 --> 00:47:36,520
Redemption that we've been seeking

1258
00:47:34,510 --> 00:47:38,349
didn't appear to produce the result that

1259
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:40,390
was promised or intended and so maybe

1260
00:47:38,349 --> 00:47:43,150
there's another place that we should

1261
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:45,250
look and that was in the Damned material

1262
00:47:43,150 --> 00:47:46,660
world right which which which was

1263
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:48,549
supposed to be at least according to

1264
00:47:46,660 --> 00:47:50,349
some elements of classic thinking

1265
00:47:48,549 --> 00:47:53,440
nothing about the creation of the devil

1266
00:47:50,349 --> 00:47:55,299
so but the point I'm making is that you

1267
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:57,160
know it's very difficult to

1268
00:47:55,299 --> 00:47:59,440
underestimate the amount of human

1269
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:02,319
motivation that's embedded in the

1270
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:05,109
attempt to alleviate suffering to

1271
00:48:02,319 --> 00:48:08,380
eradicate disease to help people live a

1272
00:48:05,109 --> 00:48:10,390
healthy a healthy life and well that's

1273
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:11,950
the disease obviously but to live a long

1274
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:13,510
life as well and to make things as

1275
00:48:11,950 --> 00:48:14,980
peaceful as possible I mean you can be

1276
00:48:13,510 --> 00:48:16,569
cynical about people and you too can

1277
00:48:14,980 --> 00:48:18,460
talk about them as motivated by power

1278
00:48:16,569 --> 00:48:20,200
and being corrupt in all of those things

1279
00:48:18,460 --> 00:48:21,490
and all of those things are true but you

1280
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:23,380
shouldn't throw away the baby with the

1281
00:48:21,490 --> 00:48:25,210
bathwater because we have been striving

1282
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:26,859
for a very long time to set things right

1283
00:48:25,210 --> 00:48:30,760
and we've done actually not too bad a

1284
00:48:26,859 --> 00:48:33,700
job of it for half starving crazy insect

1285
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:36,730
ridden chimpanzees with lifespans of 50

1286
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:38,619
to 70 years so you know we could deserve

1287
00:48:36,730 --> 00:48:40,750
a bit of sympathy for our position as

1288
00:48:38,619 --> 00:48:48,109
far as I'm concerned so

1289
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:51,180
[Applause]

1290
00:48:48,109 --> 00:48:52,470
some other representations this one I

1291
00:48:51,180 --> 00:48:54,480
like the one on the left

1292
00:48:52,470 --> 00:48:56,069
that's para de perak dice has a walled

1293
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:58,140
garden and that's what paradise means

1294
00:48:56,069 --> 00:49:00,720
it's paradise I was which is I don't

1295
00:48:58,140 --> 00:49:03,480
remember the language it's a it's a it's

1296
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:05,970
a it's associated with Persian Paradiso

1297
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:07,829
means walled garden and why a walled

1298
00:49:05,970 --> 00:49:10,140
garden well it goes back to the chaos

1299
00:49:07,829 --> 00:49:12,150
order idea so this is where God puts man

1300
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:12,720
and woman after the creation in a walled

1301
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:15,119
garden

1302
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:16,890
well the wall is culture and order in

1303
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:19,200
the garden is nature and the idea is the

1304
00:49:16,890 --> 00:49:20,819
proper human habitat is nature and

1305
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:22,980
culture in balance and swell we like

1306
00:49:20,819 --> 00:49:24,390
Gardens well why because well they're

1307
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:26,790
not completely covered with weeds and

1308
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:28,829
mosquitoes and black flies right so

1309
00:49:26,790 --> 00:49:32,130
they're civilized a little bit but still

1310
00:49:28,829 --> 00:49:34,049
within that civilization nature in its

1311
00:49:32,130 --> 00:49:35,250
more benevolent guys is encouraged to

1312
00:49:34,049 --> 00:49:37,170
flourish and people find that

1313
00:49:35,250 --> 00:49:39,809
rejuvenating and so the idea that

1314
00:49:37,170 --> 00:49:41,700
paradise the proper habitat of a human

1315
00:49:39,809 --> 00:49:43,799
being is a walled garden is a good one

1316
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:45,569
and it's walled because well you want to

1317
00:49:43,799 --> 00:49:46,980
keep things out right I mean raccoons

1318
00:49:45,569 --> 00:49:48,299
for example if you want want to keep

1319
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:50,970
those things out man even though it's

1320
00:49:48,299 --> 00:49:52,710
impossible and you know you don't you

1321
00:49:50,970 --> 00:49:54,000
don't want well there's all sorts of

1322
00:49:52,710 --> 00:49:56,099
things you don't want your garden like

1323
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:59,579
snakes walls don't seem to be much use

1324
00:49:56,099 --> 00:50:05,280
against them but the idea that paradise

1325
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:08,220
is a walled garden is is a an echo back

1326
00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:11,930
to the chaos order idea walls culture

1327
00:50:08,220 --> 00:50:15,000
right garden nature so the proper human

1328
00:50:11,930 --> 00:50:20,180
habitat is a properly tended garden now

1329
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:23,160
the radical left-leaning anti theist

1330
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:27,059
environmentalists tend to make the case

1331
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:29,730
that the predations of the Western

1332
00:50:27,059 --> 00:50:32,150
capitalist system are a consequence of

1333
00:50:29,730 --> 00:50:36,359
the injunction that was delivered in

1334
00:50:32,150 --> 00:50:38,970
Genesis by God to man to go out and

1335
00:50:36,359 --> 00:50:42,059
dominate the earth David Suzuki has

1336
00:50:38,970 --> 00:50:45,059
talked a lot about this by the way they

1337
00:50:42,059 --> 00:50:48,990
believe that that statement has given

1338
00:50:45,059 --> 00:50:50,900
rise to our inappropriate assumption

1339
00:50:48,990 --> 00:50:53,369
that we have the right to exert control

1340
00:50:50,900 --> 00:50:55,109
over the world and that that's what's

1341
00:50:53,369 --> 00:50:58,170
turned us into these terror

1342
00:50:55,109 --> 00:51:00,499
predatory monsters sometimes described

1343
00:50:58,170 --> 00:51:02,670
as cancers on the face of the earth or

1344
00:51:00,499 --> 00:51:04,680
viruses that have inhabited the entire

1345
00:51:02,670 --> 00:51:06,959
ecosystem who are doing nothing but one

1346
00:51:04,680 --> 00:51:09,239
wandering everywhere and wreaking havoc

1347
00:51:06,959 --> 00:51:12,589
as rapidly as we possibly can which is

1348
00:51:09,239 --> 00:51:14,759
another perspective on the essential

1349
00:51:12,589 --> 00:51:18,779
element of humankind that I find

1350
00:51:14,759 --> 00:51:20,369
absolutely deplorable I mean if you look

1351
00:51:18,779 --> 00:51:22,559
at the historical record for example

1352
00:51:20,369 --> 00:51:25,769
even casually you'll find out that as

1353
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:27,989
early as as late as the late 1800s 1895

1354
00:51:25,769 --> 00:51:29,309
thereabouts Thomas Huxley who was Aldous

1355
00:51:27,989 --> 00:51:32,069
Huxley's grandfather and a great

1356
00:51:29,309 --> 00:51:34,589
defender of Darwin prepared a report for

1357
00:51:32,069 --> 00:51:37,039
the British government on ocean

1358
00:51:34,589 --> 00:51:40,469
sustainability and his conclusion was

1359
00:51:37,039 --> 00:51:42,209
huh fish away guys man there's so many

1360
00:51:40,469 --> 00:51:44,009
fish out there the oceans are so

1361
00:51:42,209 --> 00:51:46,559
inexhaustible that no matter how hard

1362
00:51:44,009 --> 00:51:48,420
humanity tried for for any number of

1363
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:50,549
years the probability that we could do

1364
00:51:48,420 --> 00:51:53,309
more than put a dent in what was out

1365
00:51:50,549 --> 00:51:55,170
there was zero now Huxley turned out to

1366
00:51:53,309 --> 00:51:56,549
be wrong he didn't realize that our

1367
00:51:55,170 --> 00:51:58,650
population was going to spike so

1368
00:51:56,549 --> 00:52:00,299
dramatically partly because we got a

1369
00:51:58,650 --> 00:52:02,819
little bit rich and our children stopped

1370
00:52:00,299 --> 00:52:04,529
dying at the rate of like 60% before

1371
00:52:02,819 --> 00:52:06,199
they were 1 years old and you know we

1372
00:52:04,529 --> 00:52:08,789
actually managed to populate the you

1373
00:52:06,199 --> 00:52:10,859
earth with a few people but wasn't

1374
00:52:08,789 --> 00:52:12,239
really until 1960 or so that we woke up

1375
00:52:10,859 --> 00:52:13,589
to the fact that there were so many of

1376
00:52:12,239 --> 00:52:15,420
us that we actually hard to start paying

1377
00:52:13,589 --> 00:52:17,729
attention to what we were doing to the

1378
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:20,459
planet and that's like what 50 years ago

1379
00:52:17,729 --> 00:52:22,140
well we've just started to develop the

1380
00:52:20,459 --> 00:52:25,049
technology or the wherewithal to

1381
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:27,119
understand that the whole world might be

1382
00:52:25,049 --> 00:52:29,430
well considered a garden and we need to

1383
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:32,369
live inside the proper balance between

1384
00:52:29,430 --> 00:52:35,400
culture and order or culture and and and

1385
00:52:32,369 --> 00:52:37,979
chaos before that we were spending all

1386
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:44,489
of our time just trying not to die and

1387
00:52:37,979 --> 00:52:46,769
we usually very unsuccessfully so so I

1388
00:52:44,489 --> 00:52:49,380
don't agree with that interpretation of

1389
00:52:46,769 --> 00:52:51,569
the opening sections of Genesis I don't

1390
00:52:49,380 --> 00:52:54,059
believe that it's given human being is

1391
00:52:51,569 --> 00:52:55,559
the right to act as super predators on

1392
00:52:54,059 --> 00:52:57,749
the planet I think that instead the

1393
00:52:55,559 --> 00:53:00,029
proper environment for human beings is

1394
00:52:57,749 --> 00:53:02,219
presented quite properly as a garden and

1395
00:53:00,029 --> 00:53:04,499
that the role of people and that's

1396
00:53:02,219 --> 00:53:05,969
explicitly stated in in the second story

1397
00:53:04,499 --> 00:53:08,980
in Adam and Eve was to tend the garden

1398
00:53:05,969 --> 00:53:10,390
and that means to make

1399
00:53:08,980 --> 00:53:12,040
proper decisions and to make the sure

1400
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:14,260
that everything thrives and flourishes

1401
00:53:12,040 --> 00:53:15,550
and and so that it's good for the things

1402
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:17,200
that are living there that aren't just

1403
00:53:15,550 --> 00:53:19,660
people but also good for the people too

1404
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:22,750
so fine I think we can we could at least

1405
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:25,030
note that that's a slightly different

1406
00:53:22,750 --> 00:53:27,280
take on the story than the than the

1407
00:53:25,030 --> 00:53:29,920
ultimately cynical interpretation that's

1408
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:33,670
so commonly put forward today now inside

1409
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:36,670
that wall garden is a couple of trees

1410
00:53:33,670 --> 00:53:38,500
and Adam and even some animals and all

1411
00:53:36,670 --> 00:53:39,820
of that and unfortunately the tree

1412
00:53:38,500 --> 00:53:41,590
happens to have a snake wrapped around

1413
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:43,660
it now that's an interesting thing we're

1414
00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:45,880
gonna talk about that a lot and the

1415
00:53:43,660 --> 00:53:47,859
snake in both of these representations

1416
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:49,359
is no ordinary snake say it's got a

1417
00:53:47,859 --> 00:53:52,660
human head and it's got a human head

1418
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:55,570
there too so whatever that snake is well

1419
00:53:52,660 --> 00:53:57,430
let's forget about looking at this from

1420
00:53:55,570 --> 00:53:58,420
a religious perspective like if you can

1421
00:53:57,430 --> 00:53:59,650
just imagine that you're an

1422
00:53:58,420 --> 00:54:01,359
anthropologist and you've never seen

1423
00:53:59,650 --> 00:54:03,790
this image before it's like what do you

1424
00:54:01,359 --> 00:54:05,890
see or you see walls and you see

1425
00:54:03,790 --> 00:54:08,109
something a fairly pleasant enclosure

1426
00:54:05,890 --> 00:54:09,430
and then you see a tree and people are

1427
00:54:08,109 --> 00:54:10,869
eating from the tree but the tree has

1428
00:54:09,430 --> 00:54:13,270
the snake in it that has a human head

1429
00:54:10,869 --> 00:54:15,400
and so then you might think well what's

1430
00:54:13,270 --> 00:54:16,840
a snake with a human head and then you'd

1431
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:20,320
think well it's half snake and half

1432
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:22,090
human that's hardly revelatory it's just

1433
00:54:20,320 --> 00:54:24,730
self evidence so whatever that snake is

1434
00:54:22,090 --> 00:54:27,520
isn't just a snake it's snake and human

1435
00:54:24,730 --> 00:54:29,470
or it's it's it's its snake and partakes

1436
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:30,910
in whatever human beings are and that's

1437
00:54:29,470 --> 00:54:32,260
very important so we'll continue we'll

1438
00:54:30,910 --> 00:54:35,260
consider that later and you see the same

1439
00:54:32,260 --> 00:54:38,440
thing here and and you see in this

1440
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:40,869
particular version there's the head this

1441
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:42,820
one also has wings and so this is a

1442
00:54:40,869 --> 00:54:45,369
winged snake sort of like a dragon and

1443
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:47,020
so it curls on the ground like a reptile

1444
00:54:45,369 --> 00:54:48,970
and it's got an aerial aspect or a

1445
00:54:47,020 --> 00:54:50,380
spiritual aspect so here it's a snake

1446
00:54:48,970 --> 00:54:52,660
which is like the lowest form of

1447
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:54,040
reptilian life say something that crawls

1448
00:54:52,660 --> 00:54:54,910
on the ground it's something that's

1449
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:56,710
human and it's something that's

1450
00:54:54,910 --> 00:54:59,020
spiritual at the same time and it

1451
00:54:56,710 --> 00:55:02,890
inhabits the tree which look a lot like

1452
00:54:59,020 --> 00:55:04,330
magic mushrooms by the way and you can

1453
00:55:02,890 --> 00:55:05,830
look that up if you want that's quite an

1454
00:55:04,330 --> 00:55:08,830
interesting little rabbit hole to wander

1455
00:55:05,830 --> 00:55:10,450
down if you're curious about it but but

1456
00:55:08,830 --> 00:55:11,619
there's an idea here too is that there

1457
00:55:10,450 --> 00:55:13,630
was something in the garden at the

1458
00:55:11,619 --> 00:55:15,250
beginning of time that was like a snake

1459
00:55:13,630 --> 00:55:16,990
that was like a person that was like

1460
00:55:15,250 --> 00:55:18,700
something that was winged it was

1461
00:55:16,990 --> 00:55:20,410
something spiritual so it's spiritual

1462
00:55:18,700 --> 00:55:22,430
human and reptilian all at the same time

1463
00:55:20,410 --> 00:55:25,700
and it's the animating

1464
00:55:22,430 --> 00:55:29,510
spirit of the tree okay so keep that in

1465
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:30,830
mind thus the heavens and the earth were

1466
00:55:29,510 --> 00:55:32,690
finished this is in relationship to

1467
00:55:30,830 --> 00:55:34,190
Genesis 1 and all the host of them and

1468
00:55:32,690 --> 00:55:36,170
on the seventh day God ended his work

1469
00:55:34,190 --> 00:55:37,730
which he had made and he rested on the

1470
00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:39,650
seventh day from all his work which he

1471
00:55:37,730 --> 00:55:41,810
had made and God blessed the seventh day

1472
00:55:39,650 --> 00:55:43,250
and sanctified it because that in it he

1473
00:55:41,810 --> 00:55:45,680
had rested from all his work which God

1474
00:55:43,250 --> 00:55:47,480
created and made that's wisdom in that

1475
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:49,370
one - I think the idea of the Sabbath

1476
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:50,630
you know because one of the things I've

1477
00:55:49,370 --> 00:55:52,580
worked with a lot of people who were

1478
00:55:50,630 --> 00:55:54,110
hyper conscientious and thing about

1479
00:55:52,580 --> 00:55:56,030
hyper conscientious people is that

1480
00:55:54,110 --> 00:55:57,590
they'll just work til they die and

1481
00:55:56,030 --> 00:55:58,880
that's actually not very productive

1482
00:55:57,590 --> 00:56:00,980
because then they're dead and they can't

1483
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:02,450
work and so what you have to do with

1484
00:56:00,980 --> 00:56:03,710
hyper conscientious people is you have

1485
00:56:02,450 --> 00:56:05,030
to say well I know you'd rather do

1486
00:56:03,710 --> 00:56:06,740
nothing but work and maybe you're just

1487
00:56:05,030 --> 00:56:08,510
as guilty as you can possibly be when

1488
00:56:06,740 --> 00:56:10,040
you're not working but let's figure out

1489
00:56:08,510 --> 00:56:12,200
what you're up to and what you're up to

1490
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:14,830
you know probability is the attempt to

1491
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:18,140
be productive in the least problematic

1492
00:56:14,830 --> 00:56:19,550
longest sustaining possible manner and

1493
00:56:18,140 --> 00:56:22,250
that might mean you have to take a rest

1494
00:56:19,550 --> 00:56:24,830
and so one of the things I used to work

1495
00:56:22,250 --> 00:56:26,570
with lawyers with people who had risen

1496
00:56:24,830 --> 00:56:28,490
to the top of large law firms and they

1497
00:56:26,570 --> 00:56:29,960
were hyper productive types they're

1498
00:56:28,490 --> 00:56:32,210
often you know trying to hit their

1499
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:35,270
impossible quota for yearly hours and

1500
00:56:32,210 --> 00:56:36,770
and burning themselves to a frazzle as a

1501
00:56:35,270 --> 00:56:38,390
consequence and one of the things that

1502
00:56:36,770 --> 00:56:40,190
we used to do was they couldn't work

1503
00:56:38,390 --> 00:56:41,840
fewer hours because that a day that just

1504
00:56:40,190 --> 00:56:43,820
didn't work but what we did was we have

1505
00:56:41,840 --> 00:56:45,590
them take more time off you know like a

1506
00:56:43,820 --> 00:56:47,390
four-day weekend every two months or

1507
00:56:45,590 --> 00:56:49,520
something that was plotted out into the

1508
00:56:47,390 --> 00:56:50,630
future and then we track their billable

1509
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:52,010
hours which is their degree of

1510
00:56:50,630 --> 00:56:54,260
productivity it would actually increase

1511
00:56:52,010 --> 00:56:55,640
so that was so cool because you could

1512
00:56:54,260 --> 00:56:57,860
take hard-working people and you could

1513
00:56:55,640 --> 00:57:00,590
say look you know take a break

1514
00:56:57,860 --> 00:57:02,720
why well because you'll be more

1515
00:57:00,590 --> 00:57:04,370
productive if you take a break no that

1516
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:05,720
couldn't possibly be like I should just

1517
00:57:04,370 --> 00:57:07,400
work flat out all the time it's like

1518
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:09,230
let's test that out you take a break now

1519
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:10,640
on that it's like well what happened was

1520
00:57:09,230 --> 00:57:12,650
their productivity would increase often

1521
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:15,290
by 10 percent so there's a there's

1522
00:57:12,650 --> 00:57:18,350
wisdom here too which is okay and this

1523
00:57:15,290 --> 00:57:21,470
is alludes to the Adam and Eve story

1524
00:57:18,350 --> 00:57:23,170
near the end you you're self conscious

1525
00:57:21,470 --> 00:57:25,190
you discover the future you have to work

1526
00:57:23,170 --> 00:57:27,110
well then the question is how much

1527
00:57:25,190 --> 00:57:28,460
should you work and one answer is you

1528
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:29,810
better bloody well work all the time

1529
00:57:28,460 --> 00:57:32,240
because no matter how much work you do

1530
00:57:29,810 --> 00:57:34,070
you're not solving your problems they're

1531
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:35,750
coming along man and you can stack up

1532
00:57:34,070 --> 00:57:37,310
all the money you want you can stack up

1533
00:57:35,750 --> 00:57:39,320
the wealth you want it is not going to

1534
00:57:37,310 --> 00:57:40,700
protect you in the final analysis so you

1535
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:42,680
better be hitting the ground running and

1536
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:44,570
you better run flat-out all the time or

1537
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:47,600
what happens if you do that well then

1538
00:57:44,570 --> 00:57:49,910
you die that's not a good solution so

1539
00:57:47,600 --> 00:57:53,060
maybe you should rest and so how does

1540
00:57:49,910 --> 00:57:56,120
that rest get instantiated well it's not

1541
00:57:53,060 --> 00:57:58,010
easy to tell but one way to do it let's

1542
00:57:56,120 --> 00:58:00,380
say conceptually is to say look even God

1543
00:57:58,010 --> 00:58:02,150
had to rest one day a week and so you

1544
00:58:00,380 --> 00:58:04,790
don't have to be so presumptuous to

1545
00:58:02,150 --> 00:58:07,730
assume that if God had to rest one day a

1546
00:58:04,790 --> 00:58:12,760
week that maybe you know you are allowed

1547
00:58:07,730 --> 00:58:15,170
to work non-stop without a break at all

1548
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:17,180
you know and I think our culture has

1549
00:58:15,170 --> 00:58:18,860
slipped into that in quite a dangerous

1550
00:58:17,180 --> 00:58:20,870
way because everything is open all the

1551
00:58:18,860 --> 00:58:23,000
time and I mean I'm I'm find that just

1552
00:58:20,870 --> 00:58:25,430
as convenient as the rest of you but you

1553
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:26,600
know it's so strange to talk to modern

1554
00:58:25,430 --> 00:58:28,040
people because one of the things they

1555
00:58:26,600 --> 00:58:29,570
always tell you we say well how are you

1556
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:31,250
and what do they always say they don't

1557
00:58:29,570 --> 00:58:37,040
say good they don't say bad they say

1558
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:40,040
busy it's like yeah well okay this is

1559
00:58:37,040 --> 00:58:42,020
where Genesis 2 starts and we finally

1560
00:58:40,040 --> 00:58:44,480
got there these are the generations of

1561
00:58:42,020 --> 00:58:46,010
the heavens and of the earth when they

1562
00:58:44,480 --> 00:58:47,660
were created in the day that the Lord

1563
00:58:46,010 --> 00:58:49,430
God made the earth and the heavens and

1564
00:58:47,660 --> 00:58:50,690
every plant of the field before it was

1565
00:58:49,430 --> 00:58:52,970
in the earth and every herb of the field

1566
00:58:50,690 --> 00:58:54,590
before it grew for the Lord God had not

1567
00:58:52,970 --> 00:58:57,370
caused it to rain upon the earth and

1568
00:58:54,590 --> 00:58:59,690
there was not a man to till the ground

1569
00:58:57,370 --> 00:59:01,790
but there went up a mist from the earth

1570
00:58:59,690 --> 00:59:04,460
and watered the whole face of the ground

1571
00:59:01,790 --> 00:59:06,110
and the Lord God formed man of the dust

1572
00:59:04,460 --> 00:59:07,610
of the ground and breathed into his

1573
00:59:06,110 --> 00:59:10,790
nostrils the breath of life and man

1574
00:59:07,610 --> 00:59:12,110
became a living soul well you know

1575
00:59:10,790 --> 00:59:14,120
there's some archaic thinking and there

1576
00:59:12,110 --> 00:59:15,860
the breath is life right that's psyche

1577
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:17,960
that's spirit that's inspiration that's

1578
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:20,960
respiration that's that's all associates

1579
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:22,850
its numa like pneumatic tyre it's its

1580
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:24,830
breath and the reason that people

1581
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:26,690
associated life with breath well that's

1582
00:59:24,830 --> 00:59:28,490
not so foolish you know I mean you're

1583
00:59:26,690 --> 00:59:30,140
breathing man and something you do all

1584
00:59:28,490 --> 00:59:31,760
the time and when you die you start

1585
00:59:30,140 --> 00:59:33,860
breathing and so the idea that there's

1586
00:59:31,760 --> 00:59:35,150
something integral to life about

1587
00:59:33,860 --> 00:59:37,010
breathing is a perfectly reasonable

1588
00:59:35,150 --> 00:59:38,980
supposition it actually happens to be

1589
00:59:37,010 --> 00:59:42,400
very true and though then to associate

1590
00:59:38,980 --> 00:59:44,960
the act of creation with the act of

1591
00:59:42,400 --> 00:59:47,840
first of all inspiration and respiration

1592
00:59:44,960 --> 00:59:49,549
and and the breathing of life into

1593
00:59:47,840 --> 00:59:50,869
something that was inanimate is is

1594
00:59:49,549 --> 00:59:52,459
well what do you expect for a

1595
00:59:50,869 --> 00:59:54,919
one-sentence description it's not a bad

1596
00:59:52,459 --> 00:59:56,779
one sentence description you know so and

1597
00:59:54,919 --> 00:59:59,299
the Lord God planted a garden eastward

1598
00:59:56,779 --> 01:00:01,399
in Eden and Eden means well watered

1599
00:59:59,299 --> 01:00:03,109
place and that's particularly relevant I

1600
01:00:01,399 --> 01:00:05,149
suppose if you're a desert dweller right

1601
01:00:03,109 --> 01:00:07,309
because the issue there is can you get

1602
01:00:05,149 --> 01:00:10,159
enough water to make things grow and so

1603
01:00:07,309 --> 01:00:11,839
the the walled garden which is paradise

1604
01:00:10,159 --> 01:00:14,299
is also Eden which is a well watered

1605
01:00:11,839 --> 01:00:16,579
place and water has the element of chaos

1606
01:00:14,299 --> 01:00:19,069
we already saw that in relationship to

1607
01:00:16,579 --> 01:00:21,229
Genesis 1 where the underlying chaos was

1608
01:00:19,069 --> 01:00:24,319
often assimilated symbolically to water

1609
01:00:21,229 --> 01:00:25,849
and so the idea too is that a certain

1610
01:00:24,319 --> 01:00:27,769
amount of chaos has to be brought into

1611
01:00:25,849 --> 01:00:29,329
the order in order for it to be fruitful

1612
01:00:27,769 --> 01:00:32,029
and you can see that in the form of of

1613
01:00:29,329 --> 01:00:34,039
allowing in the water and out of the

1614
01:00:32,029 --> 01:00:35,749
ground made the Lord God to grow every

1615
01:00:34,039 --> 01:00:38,390
tree that is pleasant to the sight and

1616
01:00:35,749 --> 01:00:40,219
good for food The Tree of Life also in

1617
01:00:38,390 --> 01:00:42,069
the midst of the garden and the tree of

1618
01:00:40,219 --> 01:00:44,749
the knowledge of good and evil so two

1619
01:00:42,069 --> 01:00:47,149
trees are marked out among the rest one

1620
01:00:44,749 --> 01:00:48,380
is the Tree of Life and one is the tree

1621
01:00:47,149 --> 01:00:50,659
of the knowledge of good and evil now

1622
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:52,069
you know you know when you read

1623
01:00:50,659 --> 01:00:53,479
something like that if you're thinking

1624
01:00:52,069 --> 01:00:56,029
about it that you're in a metaphorical

1625
01:00:53,479 --> 01:00:58,549
space now we've got to be careful about

1626
01:00:56,029 --> 01:01:01,249
metaphors because you know I could say

1627
01:00:58,549 --> 01:01:03,409
and did that the chaos order idea is a

1628
01:01:01,249 --> 01:01:05,419
metaphor but then I also said oh wait a

1629
01:01:03,409 --> 01:01:07,609
second it's a metaphor but it's also

1630
01:01:05,419 --> 01:01:09,229
what your brain is adapted to and so you

1631
01:01:07,609 --> 01:01:11,209
know let's just not be pushing the idea

1632
01:01:09,229 --> 01:01:13,789
that it's merely a metaphor too hard and

1633
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:16,159
then and the same thing is is here is

1634
01:01:13,789 --> 01:01:18,409
happening here these are metaphors the

1635
01:01:16,159 --> 01:01:20,439
Tree of Life and the tree of the

1636
01:01:18,409 --> 01:01:22,609
knowledge of good and evil but that

1637
01:01:20,439 --> 01:01:25,429
doesn't exactly mean that they're mere

1638
01:01:22,609 --> 01:01:27,679
metaphors because sometimes as I

1639
01:01:25,429 --> 01:01:29,899
mentioned before and as if you have a

1640
01:01:27,679 --> 01:01:31,819
set of things and you abstract out from

1641
01:01:29,899 --> 01:01:33,559
them a common element you can make a

1642
01:01:31,819 --> 01:01:35,329
strong case that the common element is

1643
01:01:33,559 --> 01:01:37,249
more real than the set of things from

1644
01:01:35,329 --> 01:01:38,809
which you extracted it that's the whole

1645
01:01:37,249 --> 01:01:40,279
utility the abstraction why would you

1646
01:01:38,809 --> 01:01:42,139
bother with it otherwise if you can't

1647
01:01:40,279 --> 01:01:43,549
take a set of things and say look

1648
01:01:42,139 --> 01:01:45,319
there's something in common across this

1649
01:01:43,549 --> 01:01:46,789
set of things that's more important than

1650
01:01:45,319 --> 01:01:48,319
the differences between them then you

1651
01:01:46,789 --> 01:01:50,269
wouldn't bother abstracting at all and

1652
01:01:48,319 --> 01:01:51,229
so the tree of life and the tree of the

1653
01:01:50,269 --> 01:01:54,349
knowledge of good and evil are

1654
01:01:51,229 --> 01:01:56,479
abstractions now one of the questions is

1655
01:01:54,349 --> 01:01:58,609
this is a tough one man I've been tried

1656
01:01:56,479 --> 01:02:01,579
tried to figure out for a long time why

1657
01:01:58,609 --> 01:02:02,960
a fruit and something you eat would be

1658
01:02:01,579 --> 01:02:05,480
associated with the

1659
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:06,859
transformations of psychology because

1660
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:08,060
that's basically what happens in the

1661
01:02:06,859 --> 01:02:10,070
Adam and Eve story why would it be

1662
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:11,930
something that you eat now Eric Newman

1663
01:02:10,070 --> 01:02:13,369
who was one of young students had

1664
01:02:11,930 --> 01:02:15,410
written a fair bit about this and got a

1665
01:02:13,369 --> 01:02:18,109
fair ways with it he said well you know

1666
01:02:15,410 --> 01:02:20,119
we do have noted we've noticed forever

1667
01:02:18,109 --> 01:02:21,260
that the act of eating especially if

1668
01:02:20,119 --> 01:02:23,330
you're hungry especially if you're

1669
01:02:21,260 --> 01:02:25,670
starving produces a rapid spiritual

1670
01:02:23,330 --> 01:02:27,500
transformation right I mean some of you

1671
01:02:25,670 --> 01:02:29,780
this is worth knowing you probably have

1672
01:02:27,500 --> 01:02:31,970
a Crabby partner or child because

1673
01:02:29,780 --> 01:02:34,609
everyone does and one thing you might

1674
01:02:31,970 --> 01:02:37,849
try is that if they get erratic during

1675
01:02:34,609 --> 01:02:39,470
the day and you know get all volatile

1676
01:02:37,849 --> 01:02:41,660
about nothing at all it's give them

1677
01:02:39,470 --> 01:02:43,160
something to eat really I'll tell you

1678
01:02:41,660 --> 01:02:44,960
man leave this solves for I do this with

1679
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:46,730
my clinical clients all the time it's

1680
01:02:44,960 --> 01:02:48,380
like they say well I fly off the handle

1681
01:02:46,730 --> 01:02:50,150
at the littlest things it's like okay

1682
01:02:48,380 --> 01:02:51,770
yeah just try this for a week when

1683
01:02:50,150 --> 01:02:53,900
you're crabby and unreasonable eat a

1684
01:02:51,770 --> 01:02:55,609
piece of cheese or eat a peanut butter

1685
01:02:53,900 --> 01:02:57,770
sandwich eat something that's high

1686
01:02:55,609 --> 01:02:59,180
protein high fat and then just wait ten

1687
01:02:57,770 --> 01:03:01,400
minutes and see if you're sane and

1688
01:02:59,180 --> 01:03:04,190
you'll find out that you're saying after

1689
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:06,430
you eat so often that you just can't

1690
01:03:04,190 --> 01:03:09,770
believe how crazy or when you're hungry

1691
01:03:06,430 --> 01:03:11,900
look here's it's really absolutely

1692
01:03:09,770 --> 01:03:12,200
bloody remarkable so I'm telling you try

1693
01:03:11,900 --> 01:03:14,570
this

1694
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:17,089
it'll-it'll especially if you don't eat

1695
01:03:14,570 --> 01:03:20,420
breakfast this will change your life and

1696
01:03:17,089 --> 01:03:22,130
so here's a practical bit of information

1697
01:03:20,420 --> 01:03:24,109
for you to for all of you

1698
01:03:22,130 --> 01:03:29,359
antisocial types who are going to end up

1699
01:03:24,109 --> 01:03:31,880
in prison so if you're in prison and you

1700
01:03:29,359 --> 01:03:32,960
want to go on parole okay so you have to

1701
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:34,070
go in front of the judge and tell them

1702
01:03:32,960 --> 01:03:36,440
why you're not gonna do it again

1703
01:03:34,070 --> 01:03:38,420
so here's the deer's the deal it doesn't

1704
01:03:36,440 --> 01:03:40,460
really matter what you did and it

1705
01:03:38,420 --> 01:03:42,109
doesn't really matter what you promise

1706
01:03:40,460 --> 01:03:44,150
what matters is whether you see the

1707
01:03:42,109 --> 01:03:46,820
judge before lunch or after lunch

1708
01:03:44,150 --> 01:03:48,560
because if you see the judge after lunch

1709
01:03:46,820 --> 01:03:52,490
the probability that you'll get parole

1710
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:55,460
is 60% higher yeah right that is just

1711
01:03:52,490 --> 01:03:57,380
like so never have an argument with your

1712
01:03:55,460 --> 01:03:58,520
partner when you're hungry or when

1713
01:03:57,380 --> 01:03:59,930
they're hungry especially if you want

1714
01:03:58,520 --> 01:04:02,119
something for it from them it's like

1715
01:03:59,930 --> 01:04:03,710
here's the sandwich they'll eat it then

1716
01:04:02,119 --> 01:04:07,680
they'll be happy then you can manipulate

1717
01:04:03,710 --> 01:04:11,040
them before before that man no

1718
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:11,040
[Applause]

1719
01:04:11,180 --> 01:04:15,060
so you know it's it's not that

1720
01:04:13,200 --> 01:04:17,580
unreasonable to think that there's a

1721
01:04:15,060 --> 01:04:18,870
spirit in food because food rejuvenates

1722
01:04:17,580 --> 01:04:20,100
and it just doesn't rejuvenate you

1723
01:04:18,870 --> 01:04:21,690
physically it rejuvenates you

1724
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:23,580
spiritually and then of course there's

1725
01:04:21,690 --> 01:04:25,110
the other things that we consume that

1726
01:04:23,580 --> 01:04:28,050
aren't exactly like food that have a

1727
01:04:25,110 --> 01:04:30,060
walloping spiritual impact like alcohol

1728
01:04:28,050 --> 01:04:32,580
let's say which is a spirit and is

1729
01:04:30,060 --> 01:04:34,290
regarded are nice yes right I mean it's

1730
01:04:32,580 --> 01:04:36,120
the god of the vine and the god of the

1731
01:04:34,290 --> 01:04:37,770
Varden possesses you and makes you act

1732
01:04:36,120 --> 01:04:39,480
all the fun ways that alcohol makes you

1733
01:04:37,770 --> 01:04:43,230
out you know the fun ways that you

1734
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:45,600
regret the next day and so there's the

1735
01:04:43,230 --> 01:04:47,400
spiritual element of that too and and

1736
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:48,930
then but there's something even deeper

1737
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:50,790
that I think is so cool that's

1738
01:04:48,930 --> 01:04:53,460
associated with food and information

1739
01:04:50,790 --> 01:04:56,850
because the story of Adam and Eve

1740
01:04:53,460 --> 01:04:59,040
represents the fruit as producing a

1741
01:04:56,850 --> 01:05:00,840
psychological transformation and so the

1742
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:03,360
tree of the knowledge of good and evil

1743
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:04,980
is an abstraction across trees and it's

1744
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:07,680
trying to say here's something that's

1745
01:05:04,980 --> 01:05:09,660
common across trees it's it's a fruit

1746
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:12,150
that's common across trees it's

1747
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:14,250
something like that and so the fruit

1748
01:05:12,150 --> 01:05:16,230
across it's common across trees is

1749
01:05:14,250 --> 01:05:17,730
something you might call food fair

1750
01:05:16,230 --> 01:05:19,020
enough that's a generalization but

1751
01:05:17,730 --> 01:05:23,910
here's something that's even more cool

1752
01:05:19,020 --> 01:05:26,100
the food that's stable across the entire

1753
01:05:23,910 --> 01:05:29,400
domain of food isn't food it's

1754
01:05:26,100 --> 01:05:31,560
information it's information and we use

1755
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:33,000
the same bloody circuits in our brain to

1756
01:05:31,560 --> 01:05:34,710
forage for information that squirrels

1757
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:36,210
used to forage for food that animals

1758
01:05:34,710 --> 01:05:38,490
used to forage for food it's the same

1759
01:05:36,210 --> 01:05:40,170
circuit and why is that because we

1760
01:05:38,490 --> 01:05:42,060
figured out that knowing where things is

1761
01:05:40,170 --> 01:05:44,460
knowing where the food is is more

1762
01:05:42,060 --> 01:05:46,530
important than having the food and so so

1763
01:05:44,460 --> 01:05:48,840
knowing where the food is as a form of

1764
01:05:46,530 --> 01:05:51,600
mass of food information is a form of

1765
01:05:48,840 --> 01:05:53,520
meta food and once you and well that's

1766
01:05:51,600 --> 01:05:56,070
why we're information foragers and so

1767
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:58,410
once you grasp that and and that ideas

1768
01:05:56,070 --> 01:06:00,270
is embedded into the story of Adam and

1769
01:05:58,410 --> 01:06:02,730
Eve so whatever it is that they ingest

1770
01:06:00,270 --> 01:06:04,980
is a form of meta food it's it's it's

1771
01:06:02,730 --> 01:06:06,950
information and and you know we'll trade

1772
01:06:04,980 --> 01:06:09,480
food for information right so if you're

1773
01:06:06,950 --> 01:06:12,480
stuck on the edge of the highway and you

1774
01:06:09,480 --> 01:06:14,520
know you're you're hoods up and you're

1775
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:16,230
you're going places thing is turned into

1776
01:06:14,520 --> 01:06:18,630
a pile of junk that you don't understand

1777
01:06:16,230 --> 01:06:19,950
and somebody pulls beside you pulls up

1778
01:06:18,630 --> 01:06:21,570
beside you and they're a mechanic and

1779
01:06:19,950 --> 01:06:22,090
they point to something to say well just

1780
01:06:21,570 --> 01:06:23,620
put that way

1781
01:06:22,090 --> 01:06:25,840
there you'll immediately give them a

1782
01:06:23,620 --> 01:06:27,730
sandwich right or you would offer them

1783
01:06:25,840 --> 01:06:28,870
something in return you know what I mean

1784
01:06:27,730 --> 01:06:30,850
because they've provided you with

1785
01:06:28,870 --> 01:06:32,470
information that has value and it has

1786
01:06:30,850 --> 01:06:34,180
value because it actually provides you

1787
01:06:32,470 --> 01:06:35,530
with energy because information provides

1788
01:06:34,180 --> 01:06:37,570
you with energy because otherwise why

1789
01:06:35,530 --> 01:06:39,070
would we bother with it and so food

1790
01:06:37,570 --> 01:06:42,280
provides energy but so does information

1791
01:06:39,070 --> 01:06:44,050
and so there's the there's the idea of

1792
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:45,670
food that you abstract from everything

1793
01:06:44,050 --> 01:06:47,620
you can eat but then there's the idea of

1794
01:06:45,670 --> 01:06:49,180
what you could abstract from all sources

1795
01:06:47,620 --> 01:06:51,760
of food and the answer to that would be

1796
01:06:49,180 --> 01:06:53,260
information and the trees that are being

1797
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:56,320
referred to in Adam and Eve are these

1798
01:06:53,260 --> 01:06:58,150
method trees they're not ordinary trees

1799
01:06:56,320 --> 01:07:00,070
just like paradise is no ordinary place

1800
01:06:58,150 --> 01:07:02,650
just like Adam and Eve are no ordinary

1801
01:07:00,070 --> 01:07:04,360
people and just like the logos that God

1802
01:07:02,650 --> 01:07:06,880
is using at the beginning of time is no

1803
01:07:04,360 --> 01:07:08,740
ordinary conception and and these aren't

1804
01:07:06,880 --> 01:07:10,780
they're not metaphors there more than

1805
01:07:08,740 --> 01:07:12,670
metaphors there I think of them as hyper

1806
01:07:10,780 --> 01:07:14,410
realities is something like that

1807
01:07:12,670 --> 01:07:15,820
is there more real than what you see

1808
01:07:14,410 --> 01:07:17,530
there more real than the reality that

1809
01:07:15,820 --> 01:07:18,430
presents itself to you and lots of

1810
01:07:17,530 --> 01:07:20,590
things are like that

1811
01:07:18,430 --> 01:07:22,330
right numbers are like that we wouldn't

1812
01:07:20,590 --> 01:07:24,130
think or abstract if there weren't

1813
01:07:22,330 --> 01:07:28,120
things that were more real than what we

1814
01:07:24,130 --> 01:07:29,380
can see so what's most real well that's

1815
01:07:28,120 --> 01:07:31,720
partly what we're trying to figure out

1816
01:07:29,380 --> 01:07:33,160
and out of the ground made the Lord God

1817
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:35,710
to grow every tree that is pleasant to

1818
01:07:33,160 --> 01:07:37,810
this sight and good for food The Tree of

1819
01:07:35,710 --> 01:07:39,670
Life also in the midst of the garden and

1820
01:07:37,810 --> 01:07:41,230
the tree of knowledge of good and evil

1821
01:07:39,670 --> 01:07:42,550
and a river went out of Eden to water

1822
01:07:41,230 --> 01:07:44,710
the garden and from thence it was parted

1823
01:07:42,550 --> 01:07:46,450
and became into foreheads that's

1824
01:07:44,710 --> 01:07:49,150
produced a tremendous amount of

1825
01:07:46,450 --> 01:07:51,040
speculation now you know the Garden of

1826
01:07:49,150 --> 01:07:52,300
Eden is also the holy city that's

1827
01:07:51,040 --> 01:07:54,580
another way of thinking about or it's

1828
01:07:52,300 --> 01:07:56,290
Jerusalem right or it's the ideal state

1829
01:07:54,580 --> 01:07:57,760
which could be the ideal City or it

1830
01:07:56,290 --> 01:07:59,620
could be an ideal state of being or

1831
01:07:57,760 --> 01:08:01,120
could be the ideal psyche here it's all

1832
01:07:59,620 --> 01:08:03,190
of those things stacked up at the same

1833
01:08:01,120 --> 01:08:05,220
time right and this is a Mandela and

1834
01:08:03,190 --> 01:08:08,050
this is the Mandela form that people

1835
01:08:05,220 --> 01:08:10,480
what would you call hypothesized that

1836
01:08:08,050 --> 01:08:12,610
constituted the structure of paradise he

1837
01:08:10,480 --> 01:08:15,160
knows it's got this cross form that's

1838
01:08:12,610 --> 01:08:16,810
Eden itself and there's the the center

1839
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:18,370
of Eden and there's the rivers those are

1840
01:08:16,810 --> 01:08:19,810
rivers not snakes those are the rivers

1841
01:08:18,370 --> 01:08:21,550
that go out of it and they're turned

1842
01:08:19,810 --> 01:08:23,320
into these Mandela images that are

1843
01:08:21,550 --> 01:08:24,880
representative of what Jung described as

1844
01:08:23,320 --> 01:08:27,160
the self which would be the center

1845
01:08:24,880 --> 01:08:28,690
element of being that he associated of

1846
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:31,180
conscious being that he associated with

1847
01:08:28,690 --> 01:08:34,330
divinity I would say but also with the

1848
01:08:31,180 --> 01:08:36,009
idea of the holy city and so I'm just

1849
01:08:34,330 --> 01:08:37,719
showing you that to show you what we're

1850
01:08:36,009 --> 01:08:42,250
the imagination has taken ideas of

1851
01:08:37,719 --> 01:08:45,190
paradise so the name of the first river

1852
01:08:42,250 --> 01:08:46,719
is Kaizen that is which compasses the

1853
01:08:45,190 --> 01:08:48,279
whole land of havilah weather is gold

1854
01:08:46,719 --> 01:08:50,259
and the gold of that land is good

1855
01:08:48,279 --> 01:08:52,029
there's bdellium and the onyx stone and

1856
01:08:50,259 --> 01:08:53,619
the name of the second river is gijón

1857
01:08:52,029 --> 01:08:55,509
the same is it that compasseth the whole

1858
01:08:53,619 --> 01:08:57,969
land of ethiopia and the name of the

1859
01:08:55,509 --> 01:09:00,400
third river is headache L or Hideko I

1860
01:08:57,969 --> 01:09:01,960
don't know that is it which goes towards

1861
01:09:00,400 --> 01:09:04,409
the east of Assyria and the fourth River

1862
01:09:01,960 --> 01:09:07,119
is the Euphrates so there's this strange

1863
01:09:04,409 --> 01:09:09,130
intermingling there of geography with

1864
01:09:07,119 --> 01:09:10,659
mythical geography right which you see

1865
01:09:09,130 --> 01:09:12,909
happen fairly frequently in the books

1866
01:09:10,659 --> 01:09:15,639
and the Lord God took the man and put

1867
01:09:12,909 --> 01:09:17,529
him in the Garden of Eden to dress it

1868
01:09:15,639 --> 01:09:19,299
and keep it okay so that's that's a good

1869
01:09:17,529 --> 01:09:20,980
that's a good command that's what you're

1870
01:09:19,299 --> 01:09:23,019
supposed to do is take care of the damn

1871
01:09:20,980 --> 01:09:28,299
thing it was a lot of work to make right

1872
01:09:23,019 --> 01:09:30,190
took a whole week and the Lord God

1873
01:09:28,299 --> 01:09:32,639
commanded the man saying of every tree

1874
01:09:30,190 --> 01:09:34,809
of the garden thou mayest freely eat but

1875
01:09:32,639 --> 01:09:37,150
of the tree of the knowledge of good and

1876
01:09:34,809 --> 01:09:39,400
evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the

1877
01:09:37,150 --> 01:09:42,460
day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt

1878
01:09:39,400 --> 01:09:44,429
surely die well there's a sponge of

1879
01:09:42,460 --> 01:09:47,230
questions there that people have been

1880
01:09:44,429 --> 01:09:50,199
puzzling they're puzzling over for a

1881
01:09:47,230 --> 01:09:52,480
long time gaudy he's tricky character in

1882
01:09:50,199 --> 01:09:53,980
the story of Adam and Eve it's like okay

1883
01:09:52,480 --> 01:09:55,360
if we can't eat the damn thing well why

1884
01:09:53,980 --> 01:09:58,659
put in the garden to begin with that

1885
01:09:55,360 --> 01:10:00,039
would be one question and you made us

1886
01:09:58,659 --> 01:10:01,449
and then you told us not to eat this

1887
01:10:00,039 --> 01:10:02,619
knowing perfectly well that the first

1888
01:10:01,449 --> 01:10:05,170
thing we were going to do is eat it

1889
01:10:02,619 --> 01:10:07,030
because people are of exactly that type

1890
01:10:05,170 --> 01:10:10,059
which is that if you say to them with

1891
01:10:07,030 --> 01:10:12,340
their insatiable curiosity this is all

1892
01:10:10,059 --> 01:10:13,719
fine and nice but over here is something

1893
01:10:12,340 --> 01:10:15,190
you should never look at and then you

1894
01:10:13,719 --> 01:10:16,329
leave the room it's like everybody is

1895
01:10:15,190 --> 01:10:18,309
over there trying to figure out what the

1896
01:10:16,329 --> 01:10:20,590
hell that thing is instantly right

1897
01:10:18,309 --> 01:10:22,869
because we're curious curious curious

1898
01:10:20,590 --> 01:10:24,670
curious creatures and so you have to

1899
01:10:22,869 --> 01:10:27,429
wonder exactly what God was up to here

1900
01:10:24,670 --> 01:10:29,320
and there's Gnostic speculation that the

1901
01:10:27,429 --> 01:10:30,699
original God this one was not really a

1902
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:33,070
very good God he was kind of an

1903
01:10:30,699 --> 01:10:35,289
unconscious evil God and that he wanted

1904
01:10:33,070 --> 01:10:36,309
his creation to be unconscious and so

1905
01:10:35,289 --> 01:10:37,840
forbade them from developing

1906
01:10:36,309 --> 01:10:40,150
consciousness and that it was a higher

1907
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:42,070
God who and maybe in the form of the

1908
01:10:40,150 --> 01:10:44,170
serpent who tempted human beings towards

1909
01:10:42,070 --> 01:10:45,789
consciousness and you know that that

1910
01:10:44,170 --> 01:10:47,230
idea got scrubbed out of classic

1911
01:10:45,789 --> 01:10:48,460
Christianity pretty early although

1912
01:10:47,230 --> 01:10:49,390
there's something that's interesting

1913
01:10:48,460 --> 01:10:51,610
about it and

1914
01:10:49,390 --> 01:10:55,360
remnants of it in different forms that

1915
01:10:51,610 --> 01:10:58,150
stayed inside the story like the idea

1916
01:10:55,360 --> 01:11:01,210
that the fall was you know a terrible

1917
01:10:58,150 --> 01:11:02,950
tragedy but on the other hand it was the

1918
01:11:01,210 --> 01:11:04,990
precondition for the greatest event in

1919
01:11:02,950 --> 01:11:06,990
history which was the birth of Christ

1920
01:11:04,990 --> 01:11:09,340
and the redemption of mankind and so

1921
01:11:06,990 --> 01:11:11,170
it's complicated let's put it that way

1922
01:11:09,340 --> 01:11:14,290
god only knows what God was up to you

1923
01:11:11,170 --> 01:11:16,270
but you know this is a good example of

1924
01:11:14,290 --> 01:11:18,040
that ambivalence and to me again that

1925
01:11:16,270 --> 01:11:19,420
it's an indication of the sophistication

1926
01:11:18,040 --> 01:11:21,430
of the people who put these stories

1927
01:11:19,420 --> 01:11:23,050
together I also consider this somewhat

1928
01:11:21,430 --> 01:11:25,570
miraculous because you know if you're

1929
01:11:23,050 --> 01:11:26,830
just a simple propagandist of sorts you

1930
01:11:25,570 --> 01:11:28,750
wouldn't leave this sort of complexity

1931
01:11:26,830 --> 01:11:30,370
in the text you just get rid of that

1932
01:11:28,750 --> 01:11:31,630
because if you're a propagandist

1933
01:11:30,370 --> 01:11:33,970
everything is supposed to make sense

1934
01:11:31,630 --> 01:11:35,590
along the ideological plane and here God

1935
01:11:33,970 --> 01:11:37,450
is supposed to be good it's like well we

1936
01:11:35,590 --> 01:11:39,280
better get there to that line because

1937
01:11:37,450 --> 01:11:40,750
something's up with it and it isn't

1938
01:11:39,280 --> 01:11:42,880
obvious what it is but that isn't what

1939
01:11:40,750 --> 01:11:44,530
people did and to me that indicates that

1940
01:11:42,880 --> 01:11:49,600
that they were doing two things as they

1941
01:11:44,530 --> 01:11:50,950
were trying not to be too careless with

1942
01:11:49,600 --> 01:11:53,800
the traditions that they were handed

1943
01:11:50,950 --> 01:11:55,450
they they were they were touching them

1944
01:11:53,800 --> 01:11:56,410
at their peril they were very careful

1945
01:11:55,450 --> 01:11:57,700
with them and also that they were

1946
01:11:56,410 --> 01:11:59,710
actually trying to understand what was

1947
01:11:57,700 --> 01:12:02,740
going on because why otherwise keep this

1948
01:11:59,710 --> 01:12:04,300
why not just simplify it or maybe just

1949
01:12:02,740 --> 01:12:07,290
to tribute this to the devil that would

1950
01:12:04,300 --> 01:12:10,030
be easier and having God do it but and

1951
01:12:07,290 --> 01:12:12,040
the Lord God said it is not good that

1952
01:12:10,030 --> 01:12:14,050
man should be alone I will make help

1953
01:12:12,040 --> 01:12:15,430
need for him and out of the ground the

1954
01:12:14,050 --> 01:12:16,960
Lord God formed every beast of the field

1955
01:12:15,430 --> 01:12:19,000
at every fall of the air and brought

1956
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:21,100
them unto Adam to see what he would call

1957
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:22,360
them and whatsoever Adam called every

1958
01:12:21,100 --> 01:12:24,670
living creature that was the name

1959
01:12:22,360 --> 01:12:26,110
thereof and Adam gave names to all the

1960
01:12:24,670 --> 01:12:28,000
cattle in the fall of cattle means

1961
01:12:26,110 --> 01:12:30,820
animals basically and to the fall of the

1962
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:32,230
air and every beast of the field but for

1963
01:12:30,820 --> 01:12:34,330
Adam there was not found to help meet

1964
01:12:32,230 --> 01:12:37,540
for him okay well a couple of things

1965
01:12:34,330 --> 01:12:39,610
there speculations number one it's like

1966
01:12:37,540 --> 01:12:42,040
why does God care what Adam calls the

1967
01:12:39,610 --> 01:12:43,690
animals and the answer to that seems to

1968
01:12:42,040 --> 01:12:46,360
be that it's associated again with the

1969
01:12:43,690 --> 01:12:48,160
magic of speech right so that we know

1970
01:12:46,360 --> 01:12:50,050
according to this story that human

1971
01:12:48,160 --> 01:12:51,730
beings were already made in the image of

1972
01:12:50,050 --> 01:12:53,860
God and that God used language in order

1973
01:12:51,730 --> 01:12:56,260
to call order forth from chaos and that

1974
01:12:53,860 --> 01:12:58,180
human beings were made in that image and

1975
01:12:56,260 --> 01:12:58,900
so there's an echo of that here even

1976
01:12:58,180 --> 01:13:01,120
though it's from an independent

1977
01:12:58,900 --> 01:13:02,590
tradition the echo is the thing isn't

1978
01:13:01,120 --> 01:13:03,610
quite real till you name it

1979
01:13:02,590 --> 01:13:05,500
and

1980
01:13:03,610 --> 01:13:07,780
and that's that's an interesting thing

1981
01:13:05,500 --> 01:13:10,290
and we don't exactly know how far that

1982
01:13:07,780 --> 01:13:13,390
extends it's certainly the case that

1983
01:13:10,290 --> 01:13:16,390
like seem things often exist in a

1984
01:13:13,390 --> 01:13:18,010
strange potential form interconnected

1985
01:13:16,390 --> 01:13:20,320
form where everything's confusing like a

1986
01:13:18,010 --> 01:13:22,720
massive confusion before you put your

1987
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:26,530
finger on it name it what's going on

1988
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:28,150
here you name it it's like it it carves

1989
01:13:26,530 --> 01:13:30,850
it out from all that underlying chaos

1990
01:13:28,150 --> 01:13:33,040
and makes it into Agrippa belen today

1991
01:13:30,850 --> 01:13:34,570
that you can then contend with and you

1992
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:38,050
might say well it was real before you

1993
01:13:34,570 --> 01:13:40,870
named it it's like well yes it was real

1994
01:13:38,050 --> 01:13:42,430
before you named it the same way things

1995
01:13:40,870 --> 01:13:45,490
are there when there's no one there to

1996
01:13:42,430 --> 01:13:47,710
perceive them and it isn't obvious how

1997
01:13:45,490 --> 01:13:49,060
things are there when you're not there

1998
01:13:47,710 --> 01:13:50,770
to perceive them I'll tell you something

1999
01:13:49,060 --> 01:13:52,420
bloody weird about perception you can

2000
01:13:50,770 --> 01:13:54,190
look this up and John Wheeler John

2001
01:13:52,420 --> 01:13:56,560
Leader's a physicist so here's a really

2002
01:13:54,190 --> 01:13:58,390
cool thing let's say you go outside at

2003
01:13:56,560 --> 01:14:01,300
night and you look up and you see a star

2004
01:13:58,390 --> 01:14:04,060
and like so a photon from That star

2005
01:14:01,300 --> 01:14:05,890
enters your eye then maybe that photon

2006
01:14:04,060 --> 01:14:08,860
has been cruising along for like 30

2007
01:14:05,890 --> 01:14:10,930
million years do you know that that

2008
01:14:08,860 --> 01:14:12,790
photon would not have been emitted from

2009
01:14:10,930 --> 01:14:15,130
that star at that time if your eye

2010
01:14:12,790 --> 01:14:17,290
wasn't there at that time to receive it

2011
01:14:15,130 --> 01:14:18,760
you think well how in the hell can that

2012
01:14:17,290 --> 01:14:20,470
because it happened 20 million years ago

2013
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:22,450
it's like well I don't know how it can

2014
01:14:20,470 --> 01:14:24,460
be to tell you the truth but I know that

2015
01:14:22,450 --> 01:14:26,320
John Wheeler has done a very good job of

2016
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:28,900
detailing out why that's true and

2017
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:30,850
necessarily true and so a wheeler is

2018
01:14:28,900 --> 01:14:33,130
also the physicist who developed the

2019
01:14:30,850 --> 01:14:36,400
notion of it from bit and he believes

2020
01:14:33,130 --> 01:14:38,650
that the world is best construed as a

2021
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:40,630
the potential of the world is best

2022
01:14:38,650 --> 01:14:42,100
construed as a place of information it's

2023
01:14:40,630 --> 01:14:43,780
something like latent information and

2024
01:14:42,100 --> 01:14:45,370
that what consciousness does is

2025
01:14:43,780 --> 01:14:47,830
transform the latent Internet in

2026
01:14:45,370 --> 01:14:49,420
information into something like concrete

2027
01:14:47,830 --> 01:14:51,580
reality he doesn't mean that

2028
01:14:49,420 --> 01:14:53,470
metaphorically and one of the cases that

2029
01:14:51,580 --> 01:14:55,060
he makes in that regard is this story

2030
01:14:53,470 --> 01:14:56,590
that I just told you is that the photon

2031
01:14:55,060 --> 01:14:59,860
couldn't have left from where it was

2032
01:14:56,590 --> 01:15:02,320
unless it had a place to go now it's

2033
01:14:59,860 --> 01:15:04,210
it's complicated and confusing because

2034
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:05,860
from the perspective of a beam of light

2035
01:15:04,210 --> 01:15:07,360
from a photon there is no time and

2036
01:15:05,860 --> 01:15:09,490
there's no distance from one point to

2037
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:11,320
another well of course that's completely

2038
01:15:09,490 --> 01:15:13,240
impossible to understand too but from

2039
01:15:11,320 --> 01:15:15,430
the perspective of a photon the universe

2040
01:15:13,240 --> 01:15:17,110
is completely flat perpendicular to the

2041
01:15:15,430 --> 01:15:19,110
direction that the photon is traveling

2042
01:15:17,110 --> 01:15:21,610
so it's there and here at the same time

2043
01:15:19,110 --> 01:15:23,530
for us it's not it's like 20 million

2044
01:15:21,610 --> 01:15:26,409
years ago but for the photon it's it's

2045
01:15:23,530 --> 01:15:28,330
all here and now so anyways the reason

2046
01:15:26,409 --> 01:15:30,159
I'm telling you all that is because the

2047
01:15:28,330 --> 01:15:32,139
relationship between consciousness and

2048
01:15:30,159 --> 01:15:34,989
reality is by no means straightforward

2049
01:15:32,139 --> 01:15:38,800
it is seriously not straightforward and

2050
01:15:34,989 --> 01:15:40,420
physicists physicists debate what the

2051
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:42,820
relationship is between consciousness

2052
01:15:40,420 --> 01:15:44,290
and reality and they debate about what

2053
01:15:42,820 --> 01:15:45,730
the sort of phenomena that I just

2054
01:15:44,290 --> 01:15:47,199
described mean and I'm not really

2055
01:15:45,730 --> 01:15:48,969
qualified to enter into that debate

2056
01:15:47,199 --> 01:15:50,469
because I'm not a physicist but I do

2057
01:15:48,969 --> 01:15:51,820
know and I've read it fair a bit of

2058
01:15:50,469 --> 01:15:53,830
wheeler as about as much of it as I can

2059
01:15:51,820 --> 01:15:56,230
understand and I do at least know that

2060
01:15:53,830 --> 01:15:58,690
that's what he claimed and I also know

2061
01:15:56,230 --> 01:16:00,369
that that claim is it is not that's a

2062
01:15:58,690 --> 01:16:02,020
claim that's taken seriously among

2063
01:16:00,369 --> 01:16:04,300
physicists of the caliber of the

2064
01:16:02,020 --> 01:16:06,429
physicists who can understand wheeler so

2065
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:08,199
that's pretty interesting so anyways

2066
01:16:06,429 --> 01:16:09,880
there is emphasis again on this

2067
01:16:08,199 --> 01:16:12,580
importance of naming in order to make

2068
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:14,230
things real you know and sometimes

2069
01:16:12,580 --> 01:16:17,469
people won't name things just so they

2070
01:16:14,230 --> 01:16:18,940
don't become real so you know if you're

2071
01:16:17,469 --> 01:16:20,650
if you have a relationship which

2072
01:16:18,940 --> 01:16:22,480
undoubtedly you do and it has problems

2073
01:16:20,650 --> 01:16:23,980
which undoubtedly it does you bloody

2074
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:25,270
well know that lots of times there's

2075
01:16:23,980 --> 01:16:27,040
something under the carpet that no one

2076
01:16:25,270 --> 01:16:28,300
wants to name and everybody's thinking

2077
01:16:27,040 --> 01:16:30,219
well as long as we don't name it it's

2078
01:16:28,300 --> 01:16:32,560
not really there and in some sense it

2079
01:16:30,219 --> 01:16:34,270
really isn't there because you can act

2080
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:35,920
as if it's not there and get away with

2081
01:16:34,270 --> 01:16:37,150
it at least for short periods of time as

2082
01:16:35,920 --> 01:16:39,070
soon as you name that thing it's like

2083
01:16:37,150 --> 01:16:40,750
you give it form and it's there and no

2084
01:16:39,070 --> 01:16:42,400
one can ignore it and that's annoying

2085
01:16:40,750 --> 01:16:45,100
because then you have to deal with it or

2086
01:16:42,400 --> 01:16:46,389
Noor or face the consequences but the

2087
01:16:45,100 --> 01:16:50,350
reason I'm telling you that is because

2088
01:16:46,389 --> 01:16:52,480
we have a an intuition even that we can

2089
01:16:50,350 --> 01:16:54,639
have things not exist by not naming them

2090
01:16:52,480 --> 01:16:57,130
you name it and it comes forward with

2091
01:16:54,639 --> 01:16:58,840
staggering clarity and it's not as if

2092
01:16:57,130 --> 01:17:00,429
naming it is the only thing that gives

2093
01:16:58,840 --> 01:17:02,350
it reality but it is something like it

2094
01:17:00,429 --> 01:17:03,909
sharpens it and brings it into focus and

2095
01:17:02,350 --> 01:17:07,179
gives it borders and barriers and

2096
01:17:03,909 --> 01:17:08,980
borders and boundaries and so anyways

2097
01:17:07,179 --> 01:17:10,989
guards interested enough and what Adam

2098
01:17:08,980 --> 01:17:13,000
has to say that he has him named all the

2099
01:17:10,989 --> 01:17:15,219
animals and that sort of makes them into

2100
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:17,590
animals no there's more to the

2101
01:17:15,219 --> 01:17:19,389
Linguistics story than that so social

2102
01:17:17,590 --> 01:17:21,159
psychologists Roger Brown was one of

2103
01:17:19,389 --> 01:17:24,159
them studied this really interesting

2104
01:17:21,159 --> 01:17:25,659
phenomena which is associated with the

2105
01:17:24,159 --> 01:17:28,090
relationship between perception and

2106
01:17:25,659 --> 01:17:31,030
action you know how a kid will call a

2107
01:17:28,090 --> 01:17:33,250
particular animal a cat well the word

2108
01:17:31,030 --> 01:17:35,800
path is very short like the word dog and

2109
01:17:33,250 --> 01:17:38,980
it turns out that you know you could

2110
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:40,869
think that we could perceive cats as

2111
01:17:38,980 --> 01:17:42,820
multicellular organisms like we could

2112
01:17:40,869 --> 01:17:44,800
see the self we could see the molecules

2113
01:17:42,820 --> 01:17:46,869
we could see the atoms we could see or

2114
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:49,389
we could see the ecosystem that the cat

2115
01:17:46,869 --> 01:17:52,179
is part of but we don't or maybe the

2116
01:17:49,389 --> 01:17:54,039
broader mammalian classification that

2117
01:17:52,179 --> 01:17:56,619
it's part of we could perceive that as

2118
01:17:54,039 --> 01:17:58,710
the unit of perception but we don't we

2119
01:17:56,619 --> 01:18:02,110
perceive things at the level of cat and

2120
01:17:58,710 --> 01:18:04,090
you can tell the perceptual level that

2121
01:18:02,110 --> 01:18:05,739
people naturally perceive that which

2122
01:18:04,090 --> 01:18:07,420
doesn't seem to be socio-culturally

2123
01:18:05,739 --> 01:18:09,400
determined to any great degree by the

2124
01:18:07,420 --> 01:18:11,619
way because the words are often short

2125
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:14,650
and easily remembered and early learned

2126
01:18:11,619 --> 01:18:16,960
and so there's this level of analysis

2127
01:18:14,650 --> 01:18:19,329
out of all the possible levels of

2128
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:21,400
analysis that the world does exist at we

2129
01:18:19,329 --> 01:18:23,170
perceive it at a certain level of

2130
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:24,639
analysis and that level of analysis

2131
01:18:23,170 --> 01:18:26,920
seems to have something to do with the

2132
01:18:24,639 --> 01:18:29,349
world's functional utility for us at

2133
01:18:26,920 --> 01:18:31,539
that level and the perception at that

2134
01:18:29,349 --> 01:18:34,119
level and the naming at that level gives

2135
01:18:31,539 --> 01:18:36,369
things a reality at that level you know

2136
01:18:34,119 --> 01:18:38,139
because the thing about things is that

2137
01:18:36,369 --> 01:18:39,940
they're not easily separable from other

2138
01:18:38,139 --> 01:18:43,030
things they tangled together in all

2139
01:18:39,940 --> 01:18:45,489
sorts of strange ways and yet when we

2140
01:18:43,030 --> 01:18:47,349
cast our eye and and and use our

2141
01:18:45,489 --> 01:18:49,920
language to orient ourselves in the

2142
01:18:47,349 --> 01:18:52,270
world we cut things up into discrete

2143
01:18:49,920 --> 01:18:53,710
discriminable objects that we can then

2144
01:18:52,270 --> 01:18:55,900
utilize and there's something about that

2145
01:18:53,710 --> 01:18:58,119
that makes them real in a way that

2146
01:18:55,900 --> 01:18:59,559
they're interconnected potential the

2147
01:18:58,119 --> 01:19:02,199
interconnected potential that they were

2148
01:18:59,559 --> 01:19:03,909
before that that it's not it's not real

2149
01:19:02,199 --> 01:19:05,619
in the same way at least I think it's

2150
01:19:03,909 --> 01:19:06,909
even less real I think that's a right

2151
01:19:05,619 --> 01:19:09,639
way of thinking about it even though

2152
01:19:06,909 --> 01:19:12,579
it's not completely unreal but it's an

2153
01:19:09,639 --> 01:19:14,590
echo atoms a little God at that point a

2154
01:19:12,579 --> 01:19:16,150
little God the farther and God's already

2155
01:19:14,590 --> 01:19:17,739
done the groundwork but Adam has to come

2156
01:19:16,150 --> 01:19:20,079
along and says say well that's a cat

2157
01:19:17,739 --> 01:19:22,150
it's like poof whatever that is is now a

2158
01:19:20,079 --> 01:19:25,210
cat and that's a dog and that's a sheep

2159
01:19:22,150 --> 01:19:28,750
and you know it gives them it gives them

2160
01:19:25,210 --> 01:19:30,159
something like pragmatic form but for

2161
01:19:28,750 --> 01:19:31,170
Adam there was not found to help meet

2162
01:19:30,159 --> 01:19:34,179
for him

2163
01:19:31,170 --> 01:19:36,280
and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to

2164
01:19:34,179 --> 01:19:37,960
fall upon Adam and he slept and he and

2165
01:19:36,280 --> 01:19:39,730
God took one of his ribs and closed up

2166
01:19:37,960 --> 01:19:41,409
the flesh instead thereof and the rib

2167
01:19:39,730 --> 01:19:43,179
which the Lord God had taken from man

2168
01:19:41,409 --> 01:19:43,500
made he a woman and brought her unto the

2169
01:19:43,179 --> 01:19:45,390
man

2170
01:19:43,500 --> 01:19:47,760
and Adam said this is now bone of my

2171
01:19:45,390 --> 01:19:49,260
bones and flesh of my flesh she shall be

2172
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:52,110
called woman because she was taken out

2173
01:19:49,260 --> 01:19:53,310
of man therefore shall a man leave his

2174
01:19:52,110 --> 01:19:54,960
father and his mother and shall cleave

2175
01:19:53,310 --> 01:19:57,300
unto his wife and they shall be one

2176
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:58,380
flesh that's a walloping statement to

2177
01:19:57,300 --> 01:19:59,310
put in there at the end of those three

2178
01:19:58,380 --> 01:20:01,290
sentences

2179
01:19:59,310 --> 01:20:03,120
I mean therefore comes as somewhat of a

2180
01:20:01,290 --> 01:20:05,670
surprise but there's an injunction there

2181
01:20:03,120 --> 01:20:07,920
well it's a good injunction man you know

2182
01:20:05,670 --> 01:20:09,390
tell you people who don't do that they

2183
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:11,280
have a hell of a time in their marriage

2184
01:20:09,390 --> 01:20:12,720
and so this is a good thing to know if

2185
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:17,340
you are married or if you're planning to

2186
01:20:12,720 --> 01:20:18,840
get married is like you know we have

2187
01:20:17,340 --> 01:20:21,330
very strong orientation towards our

2188
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:24,870
parents and for good reason it's like

2189
01:20:21,330 --> 01:20:28,230
the injunction here is that secondary as

2190
01:20:24,870 --> 01:20:30,030
soon as you're married and failure to do

2191
01:20:28,230 --> 01:20:32,550
that makes your marriage collapse and

2192
01:20:30,030 --> 01:20:33,660
then you deserve it to collapse - as far

2193
01:20:32,550 --> 01:20:34,650
as I'm concerned because it's a

2194
01:20:33,660 --> 01:20:36,900
reflection of your pathological

2195
01:20:34,650 --> 01:20:38,820
immaturity and your unwillingness to

2196
01:20:36,900 --> 01:20:40,770
extract yourself from the you know

2197
01:20:38,820 --> 01:20:42,390
telling like grip of parents who are a

2198
01:20:40,770 --> 01:20:44,310
little bit too much on the interfering

2199
01:20:42,390 --> 01:20:46,170
side but the injunction there's there's

2200
01:20:44,310 --> 01:20:48,650
a deep injunction here it's very

2201
01:20:46,170 --> 01:20:53,130
complicated so one of the ideas is that

2202
01:20:48,650 --> 01:20:55,200
the original Adam wasn't a man like like

2203
01:20:53,130 --> 01:20:57,480
a separate man it was more like a

2204
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:58,880
hermaphroditic being and in that him

2205
01:20:57,480 --> 01:21:01,320
Alfred etic being there was a kind of

2206
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:03,690
undifferentiated perfection and then

2207
01:21:01,320 --> 01:21:05,790
that was split into male and female and

2208
01:21:03,690 --> 01:21:07,950
then that part of the goal of human

2209
01:21:05,790 --> 01:21:10,530
beings is to reunite that as the

2210
01:21:07,950 --> 01:21:12,480
singular unity that reestablishes the

2211
01:21:10,530 --> 01:21:13,860
initial perfection and that's actually

2212
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:15,390
the goal of marriage from a spiritual

2213
01:21:13,860 --> 01:21:17,010
perspective and you could read about

2214
01:21:15,390 --> 01:21:18,450
that if you read young because he wrote

2215
01:21:17,010 --> 01:21:21,360
quite a bit about that so lovely it's

2216
01:21:18,450 --> 01:21:23,850
such a good idea so I had these friends

2217
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:24,870
that went to Sweden to get married they

2218
01:21:23,850 --> 01:21:26,850
were northern they were from northern

2219
01:21:24,870 --> 01:21:28,680
Alberta but his heritage their both

2220
01:21:26,850 --> 01:21:32,010
their Heritage's were sweet Swedish and

2221
01:21:28,680 --> 01:21:33,900
in this ceremony they did this cool

2222
01:21:32,010 --> 01:21:35,700
thing yes they they were being married

2223
01:21:33,900 --> 01:21:37,860
and they had to hold a candle up between

2224
01:21:35,700 --> 01:21:39,480
them right while they were being married

2225
01:21:37,860 --> 01:21:42,420
and you think well okay what's the

2226
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:44,370
candle what's the source of light it's a

2227
01:21:42,420 --> 01:21:45,390
source of illumination right it's a

2228
01:21:44,370 --> 01:21:46,920
source of enlightenment

2229
01:21:45,390 --> 01:21:49,260
it's the candle that you put on

2230
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:50,730
Christmas trees in in Europe so it's the

2231
01:21:49,260 --> 01:21:52,500
light that emerges in the darkness in

2232
01:21:50,730 --> 01:21:55,170
the depth of winter it's a symbol of

2233
01:21:52,500 --> 01:21:56,600
life in in darkness it's the reemergence

2234
01:21:55,170 --> 01:21:58,940
of the Sun that the

2235
01:21:56,600 --> 01:22:01,100
at the darkest coldest time of the year

2236
01:21:58,940 --> 01:22:02,570
which is also associated symbolically

2237
01:22:01,100 --> 01:22:04,700
with the REIT with the birth of Christ

2238
01:22:02,570 --> 01:22:06,740
for all sorts of complicated reasons and

2239
01:22:04,700 --> 01:22:08,000
so the candles all that and then the

2240
01:22:06,740 --> 01:22:09,800
next question is why do you hold it

2241
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:11,810
above you and the answer is because

2242
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:13,670
what's above you is what you're below -

2243
01:22:11,810 --> 01:22:15,680
so it's single simplify something

2244
01:22:13,670 --> 01:22:17,540
transcendent and so why do you both hold

2245
01:22:15,680 --> 01:22:20,420
on to it well cuz you're both supposed

2246
01:22:17,540 --> 01:22:22,160
to hold on to the light right and you're

2247
01:22:20,420 --> 01:22:24,680
supposed to be subordinate to the light

2248
01:22:22,160 --> 01:22:27,590
and so you ask well who's in charge in a

2249
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:29,750
marriage well the light that's the idea

2250
01:22:27,590 --> 01:22:30,740
so you come together as one thing you no

2251
01:22:29,750 --> 01:22:32,420
longer two things

2252
01:22:30,740 --> 01:22:33,890
it isn't what's good for you and it's

2253
01:22:32,420 --> 01:22:35,660
not what's good for your wife it's

2254
01:22:33,890 --> 01:22:37,700
what's good for the marriage and the

2255
01:22:35,660 --> 01:22:39,770
marriage is about the combined being

2256
01:22:37,700 --> 01:22:43,490
which is the reassembly of the original

2257
01:22:39,770 --> 01:22:45,050
Hema firma burma frenetic hermaphroditic

2258
01:22:43,490 --> 01:22:47,450
being at the beginning of time

2259
01:22:45,050 --> 01:22:50,090
that's the idea and that's all packed

2260
01:22:47,450 --> 01:22:52,280
into like these four sentences and you

2261
01:22:50,090 --> 01:22:54,200
know there's been well all of these

2262
01:22:52,280 --> 01:22:55,700
sentences have tremendous history of

2263
01:22:54,200 --> 01:22:57,560
interpretation associated with them

2264
01:22:55,700 --> 01:22:59,030
right it's just endless and endless and

2265
01:22:57,560 --> 01:23:01,880
endless and that's one of the lines and

2266
01:22:59,030 --> 01:23:04,160
so it's also an antidote to the idea

2267
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:05,960
that women taken out of man which is

2268
01:23:04,160 --> 01:23:08,390
obviously the reverse of the biological

2269
01:23:05,960 --> 01:23:10,130
process by the way meets women in some

2270
01:23:08,390 --> 01:23:12,380
sense subordinate to man that is not

2271
01:23:10,130 --> 01:23:14,630
built into this text I don't see that at

2272
01:23:12,380 --> 01:23:16,340
all is built into the text and there's

2273
01:23:14,630 --> 01:23:21,860
something else that's associated with it

2274
01:23:16,340 --> 01:23:24,920
too and there's an idea that you know in

2275
01:23:21,860 --> 01:23:27,050
in in sleeping beauty you know sleeping

2276
01:23:24,920 --> 01:23:28,970
beauty goes to sleep and the reason she

2277
01:23:27,050 --> 01:23:31,520
goes to sleep is because you have to

2278
01:23:28,970 --> 01:23:33,080
remember what happens is she has parents

2279
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:35,030
who are quite old and so they're pretty

2280
01:23:33,080 --> 01:23:36,980
desperate to have a child like so many

2281
01:23:35,030 --> 01:23:39,170
people are now and they only have one

2282
01:23:36,980 --> 01:23:41,270
child like so many people do now and

2283
01:23:39,170 --> 01:23:43,400
they don't anything it happened to this

2284
01:23:41,270 --> 01:23:46,520
child because like hey it's a miracle

2285
01:23:43,400 --> 01:23:48,110
and there's only one of them and so and

2286
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:50,270
she's the princess and so it's like

2287
01:23:48,110 --> 01:23:51,650
we're not letting anything around her so

2288
01:23:50,270 --> 01:23:54,200
they have a big christening party right

2289
01:23:51,650 --> 01:23:57,560
and they invite everybody but they don't

2290
01:23:54,200 --> 01:23:59,240
invite Maleficent and Maleficent is the

2291
01:23:57,560 --> 01:24:01,280
terrible mother she's nature

2292
01:23:59,240 --> 01:24:03,860
she's like the thing that goes bump in

2293
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:05,870
the night she's the devil herself so to

2294
01:24:03,860 --> 01:24:07,640
speak she's everything that you don't

2295
01:24:05,870 --> 01:24:09,110
want your child to encounter so the king

2296
01:24:07,640 --> 01:24:10,110
and queen saying well we just want to

2297
01:24:09,110 --> 01:24:12,510
invite her to the Krishna

2298
01:24:10,110 --> 01:24:14,639
it's like good luck with that that's an

2299
01:24:12,510 --> 01:24:16,380
eatable story right the eatable mother

2300
01:24:14,639 --> 01:24:19,110
is the mother who devours her child by

2301
01:24:16,380 --> 01:24:21,719
refusing by over protecting him or her

2302
01:24:19,110 --> 01:24:23,400
so that instead of being strengthened by

2303
01:24:21,719 --> 01:24:26,340
an encounter with the terrible world

2304
01:24:23,400 --> 01:24:27,420
they're weakened by too much protection

2305
01:24:26,340 --> 01:24:30,239
and then when they're let out into the

2306
01:24:27,420 --> 01:24:31,710
world they cannot live and that's the

2307
01:24:30,239 --> 01:24:33,750
story of Sleeping Beauty and that's what

2308
01:24:31,710 --> 01:24:36,060
the king and queen do and they apologize

2309
01:24:33,750 --> 01:24:38,190
to the two Maleficent when she first

2310
01:24:36,060 --> 01:24:39,690
shows up and say well you know they have

2311
01:24:38,190 --> 01:24:40,530
a bunch of half-witted excuses why they

2312
01:24:39,690 --> 01:24:43,170
don't invite her

2313
01:24:40,530 --> 01:24:44,969
we forgot it's like I don't think so you

2314
01:24:43,170 --> 01:24:47,219
know you don't forget something like

2315
01:24:44,969 --> 01:24:49,860
that and she kind of makes that point

2316
01:24:47,219 --> 01:24:51,210
it's right the whole horror of life you

2317
01:24:49,860 --> 01:24:52,619
don't forget about that when you have a

2318
01:24:51,210 --> 01:24:54,300
child that's for sure you might wish

2319
01:24:52,619 --> 01:24:56,100
that it would stay at bay but you do not

2320
01:24:54,300 --> 01:24:58,080
forget about it the question is do you

2321
01:24:56,100 --> 01:25:00,270
invite it to the party and the answer is

2322
01:24:58,080 --> 01:25:02,310
it bloody well depends how unconscious

2323
01:25:00,270 --> 01:25:03,900
you want your child to be and if you

2324
01:25:02,310 --> 01:25:05,219
want your child to be unconscious well

2325
01:25:03,900 --> 01:25:07,080
then you have the added advantage that

2326
01:25:05,219 --> 01:25:08,550
maybe they won't leave home and so you

2327
01:25:07,080 --> 01:25:10,500
can take advantage of them for the rest

2328
01:25:08,550 --> 01:25:13,139
of your sad life instead of going off to

2329
01:25:10,500 --> 01:25:14,580
find something to do for yourself well

2330
01:25:13,139 --> 01:25:16,739
and then of course you can take revenge

2331
01:25:14,580 --> 01:25:18,300
on them if they do have any any what

2332
01:25:16,739 --> 01:25:19,920
would you call impetus towards courage

2333
01:25:18,300 --> 01:25:21,630
that you sacrificed yourself thirty

2334
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:22,980
years ago and want to stamp out as soon

2335
01:25:21,630 --> 01:25:24,540
as you see it developing your child

2336
01:25:22,980 --> 01:25:26,850
that's another thing that would be quite

2337
01:25:24,540 --> 01:25:29,310
pleasant and so that's what happens in

2338
01:25:26,850 --> 01:25:30,900
Sleeping Beauty yeah well none of this

2339
01:25:29,310 --> 01:25:32,760
is pleasant and nothing that happens in

2340
01:25:30,900 --> 01:25:34,260
that story is pleasant so Sleeping

2341
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:35,730
Beauty she's naive as hell they put her

2342
01:25:34,260 --> 01:25:37,949
out in the forest and have it raised by

2343
01:25:35,730 --> 01:25:39,960
these three like goody two-shoes fairies

2344
01:25:37,949 --> 01:25:42,360
that are also completely devoid of any

2345
01:25:39,960 --> 01:25:44,580
real potency and power right there's no

2346
01:25:42,360 --> 01:25:46,380
nothing Maleficent about them and then

2347
01:25:44,580 --> 01:25:48,239
the first idiot Prince that wanders by

2348
01:25:46,380 --> 01:25:49,920
she falls in love with so badly that she

2349
01:25:48,239 --> 01:25:52,110
has post-traumatic stress disorder

2350
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:55,080
really rides off on his horse right

2351
01:25:52,110 --> 01:25:56,639
that's what happens and then she then

2352
01:25:55,080 --> 01:25:58,170
she goes into the castle and she's all

2353
01:25:56,639 --> 01:26:00,330
freaked out because she met the love of

2354
01:25:58,170 --> 01:26:02,130
her life for like five minutes for God's

2355
01:26:00,330 --> 01:26:03,750
sake and you know that's when the

2356
01:26:02,130 --> 01:26:06,179
spinning wheel that's the Wheel of Fate

2357
01:26:03,750 --> 01:26:07,710
pops up and she pricks her finger right

2358
01:26:06,179 --> 01:26:09,030
they try to get rid of all the spinning

2359
01:26:07,710 --> 01:26:11,100
wheels they try to get rid of all the

2360
01:26:09,030 --> 01:26:12,989
wheels of fate with her pointed end but

2361
01:26:11,100 --> 01:26:15,570
she finds it poke pricks or fingers and

2362
01:26:12,989 --> 01:26:17,400
finger falls down unconscious well she

2363
01:26:15,570 --> 01:26:19,409
wants to be unconscious and no bloody

2364
01:26:17,400 --> 01:26:21,510
wonder she was protected her whole life

2365
01:26:19,409 --> 01:26:23,340
she's so damn naive that her first love

2366
01:26:21,510 --> 01:26:23,949
affair just about kills her she wants to

2367
01:26:23,340 --> 01:26:25,989
go to sleep

2368
01:26:23,949 --> 01:26:27,820
never wake up and so that's exactly what

2369
01:26:25,989 --> 01:26:29,769
happens and then she has to wait for the

2370
01:26:27,820 --> 01:26:31,749
Prince to come and rescue her well you

2371
01:26:29,769 --> 01:26:34,360
think how sexist can you get that story

2372
01:26:31,749 --> 01:26:36,159
well seriously because that's that's the

2373
01:26:34,360 --> 01:26:37,690
way that that would be read and in the

2374
01:26:36,159 --> 01:26:39,639
modern world it's like she doesn't need

2375
01:26:37,690 --> 01:26:41,440
a prince to rescue her that's why I

2376
01:26:39,639 --> 01:26:51,280
Disney made frozen that absolutely

2377
01:26:41,440 --> 01:26:53,440
appalling piece of rubbish so you know

2378
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:55,209
you can say you can say well the

2379
01:26:53,440 --> 01:26:57,070
princess doesn't need a prince to rescue

2380
01:26:55,209 --> 01:26:58,929
her but you know that's a boneheaded way

2381
01:26:57,070 --> 01:27:01,119
of looking at the story because the

2382
01:26:58,929 --> 01:27:02,709
prince isn't just a man who's coming to

2383
01:27:01,119 --> 01:27:03,940
rescue the woman and believe me he's got

2384
01:27:02,709 --> 01:27:05,590
his own problems right he's got a whole

2385
01:27:03,940 --> 01:27:09,219
goddamn dragon he has to contend with

2386
01:27:05,590 --> 01:27:11,050
but but the prince also represents the

2387
01:27:09,219 --> 01:27:13,150
woman's own consciousness the

2388
01:27:11,050 --> 01:27:14,769
consciousness is presented very

2389
01:27:13,150 --> 01:27:16,809
frequently in stories as symbolically

2390
01:27:14,769 --> 01:27:19,209
masculine as it is with the logos idea

2391
01:27:16,809 --> 01:27:21,039
and the idea is that without without

2392
01:27:19,209 --> 01:27:23,679
that forward going courageous

2393
01:27:21,039 --> 01:27:25,929
consciousness a woman herself will drift

2394
01:27:23,679 --> 01:27:28,030
into unconsciousness and terror and so

2395
01:27:25,929 --> 01:27:30,340
you can read it as well the woman who's

2396
01:27:28,030 --> 01:27:32,139
sleeping needs a man to wake her up and

2397
01:27:30,340 --> 01:27:33,459
of course just like a man needs a woman

2398
01:27:32,139 --> 01:27:35,199
to wake him up it's the same damn thing

2399
01:27:33,459 --> 01:27:37,749
that's the dragon fight in Sleeping

2400
01:27:35,199 --> 01:27:39,940
Beauty but it's also the case that if

2401
01:27:37,749 --> 01:27:42,340
she's only unconscious all she can do is

2402
01:27:39,940 --> 01:27:44,920
lay there and sleep like the sleep of

2403
01:27:42,340 --> 01:27:47,440
the naive and Damned she has to wake and

2404
01:27:44,920 --> 01:27:49,360
wake herself up and and and bring her

2405
01:27:47,440 --> 01:27:51,369
own consciousness her own masculine

2406
01:27:49,360 --> 01:27:53,079
consciousness into the forefront so that

2407
01:27:51,369 --> 01:27:54,489
she can survive in the world and of

2408
01:27:53,079 --> 01:27:56,469
course women are trying to do that like

2409
01:27:54,489 --> 01:27:59,139
mad but that's partly what's represented

2410
01:27:56,469 --> 01:28:01,030
in the story like that and that's partly

2411
01:27:59,139 --> 01:28:03,880
what's implicit in this idea is that

2412
01:28:01,030 --> 01:28:06,070
unless the woman is taken out of man so

2413
01:28:03,880 --> 01:28:09,429
to speak then she isn't a human being

2414
01:28:06,070 --> 01:28:11,320
she's just a creature and that's partly

2415
01:28:09,429 --> 01:28:14,519
what's embedded in this story so you

2416
01:28:11,320 --> 01:28:16,840
don't want to read it as a patriarchal

2417
01:28:14,519 --> 01:28:20,110
you don't want to read anything that way

2418
01:28:16,840 --> 01:28:22,119
so really it's it really it's yeah I

2419
01:28:20,110 --> 01:28:24,219
won't bother with that but really we can

2420
01:28:22,119 --> 01:28:25,389
do better than that man therefore shall

2421
01:28:24,219 --> 01:28:27,039
a man leave his father and his mother

2422
01:28:25,389 --> 01:28:29,949
and shall cleave unto his wife and they

2423
01:28:27,039 --> 01:28:31,479
shall be one flesh it's like yeah thing

2424
01:28:29,949 --> 01:28:33,429
another thing about marriage this is

2425
01:28:31,479 --> 01:28:35,260
really worth knowing too is that I read

2426
01:28:33,429 --> 01:28:36,610
this in part from reading young it's

2427
01:28:35,260 --> 01:28:37,450
like what do you do when you get married

2428
01:28:36,610 --> 01:28:39,820
that's easy

2429
01:28:37,450 --> 01:28:42,490
see you take someone who's just as

2430
01:28:39,820 --> 01:28:45,670
useless and horrible as you are and then

2431
01:28:42,490 --> 01:28:49,420
you shackle yourself to them and then

2432
01:28:45,670 --> 01:28:52,060
you say we're not running away no matter

2433
01:28:49,420 --> 01:28:53,560
what happens yeah well that that's

2434
01:28:52,060 --> 01:28:56,620
perfect because then you don't get to

2435
01:28:53,560 --> 01:28:57,880
run away and the thing is is like if you

2436
01:28:56,620 --> 01:29:00,130
can run away you can't tell each other

2437
01:28:57,880 --> 01:29:01,600
the truth because if you tell someone

2438
01:29:00,130 --> 01:29:04,240
the truth about you and they don't run

2439
01:29:01,600 --> 01:29:05,710
away they weren't listening and so if

2440
01:29:04,240 --> 01:29:07,030
you don't have someone around they can't

2441
01:29:05,710 --> 01:29:08,920
run away then you can't tell them the

2442
01:29:07,030 --> 01:29:11,230
truth and so that's part of the purpose

2443
01:29:08,920 --> 01:29:13,180
of the marriage it's like okay okay I'll

2444
01:29:11,230 --> 01:29:15,490
bet on you you bet on me it's a losing

2445
01:29:13,180 --> 01:29:17,200
bet we both know that but given our

2446
01:29:15,490 --> 01:29:19,600
current circumstances were unlikely to

2447
01:29:17,200 --> 01:29:26,020
find anyone better that's for sure you

2448
01:29:19,600 --> 01:29:27,670
know there's two things that come off of

2449
01:29:26,020 --> 01:29:29,620
that one is you know people are waiting

2450
01:29:27,670 --> 01:29:31,270
around to find mr. or mrs. right it's

2451
01:29:29,620 --> 01:29:32,860
like here's something to think about man

2452
01:29:31,270 --> 01:29:34,540
to put yourself on your feet right if

2453
01:29:32,860 --> 01:29:36,250
you went to a party and you found mr.

2454
01:29:34,540 --> 01:29:37,780
right and he looked at you and didn't

2455
01:29:36,250 --> 01:29:40,450
run away screaming that would indicate

2456
01:29:37,780 --> 01:29:43,560
that he wasn't mr. right at all right

2457
01:29:40,450 --> 01:29:45,250
it's like the old Nietzsche and joke if

2458
01:29:43,560 --> 01:29:48,030
someone loves you that should

2459
01:29:45,250 --> 01:29:50,470
immediately disenchant you with them

2460
01:29:48,030 --> 01:29:52,180
right right or it's the Woody Allen joke

2461
01:29:50,470 --> 01:29:55,300
I never belonged to a club that would

2462
01:29:52,180 --> 01:29:56,710
take me as a member so so that said

2463
01:29:55,300 --> 01:29:58,240
that's an interesting that's a very

2464
01:29:56,710 --> 01:30:01,150
interesting thing to think about and so

2465
01:29:58,240 --> 01:30:04,150
you're going to shackle yourself to

2466
01:30:01,150 --> 01:30:08,140
someone who's just as imperfect as you

2467
01:30:04,150 --> 01:30:10,150
are and then the issue is you you you

2468
01:30:08,140 --> 01:30:12,310
might be in a situation where you can

2469
01:30:10,150 --> 01:30:14,170
actually negotiate because you might

2470
01:30:12,310 --> 01:30:15,730
think well there's some things about you

2471
01:30:14,170 --> 01:30:16,990
that aren't going so right and there's

2472
01:30:15,730 --> 01:30:18,790
some things about me that aren't going

2473
01:30:16,990 --> 01:30:20,440
so right and we're bloody well stuck

2474
01:30:18,790 --> 01:30:22,090
with the consequences for the next 50

2475
01:30:20,440 --> 01:30:25,180
years so we could we can either

2476
01:30:22,090 --> 01:30:26,860
straighten this out or we can suffer

2477
01:30:25,180 --> 01:30:28,720
through it for the next five decades and

2478
01:30:26,860 --> 01:30:30,790
you know people are of the sort that

2479
01:30:28,720 --> 01:30:33,190
without that degree of seriousness those

2480
01:30:30,790 --> 01:30:35,020
problems will not be solved you'll leave

2481
01:30:33,190 --> 01:30:36,580
things unnamed because there's always an

2482
01:30:35,020 --> 01:30:37,720
out it's like and it's the same thing

2483
01:30:36,580 --> 01:30:39,220
when you're living together with someone

2484
01:30:37,720 --> 01:30:40,720
you know that people who live together

2485
01:30:39,220 --> 01:30:42,670
before they're married are more likely

2486
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:44,500
to get divorced not less likely and the

2487
01:30:42,670 --> 01:30:45,730
reason for that is what exactly are you

2488
01:30:44,500 --> 01:30:50,349
saying to one another when you live with

2489
01:30:45,730 --> 01:30:54,730
each other just think about it well

2490
01:30:50,349 --> 01:30:58,659
for now you're better than anything else

2491
01:30:54,730 --> 01:31:06,520
I can trick but I'd like to reserve the

2492
01:30:58,659 --> 01:31:08,530
right to trade you in conveniently if

2493
01:31:06,520 --> 01:31:10,920
someone bitter happens to stumble into

2494
01:31:08,530 --> 01:31:10,920
me

2495
01:31:16,050 --> 01:31:20,040
well how could how could someone not be

2496
01:31:18,330 --> 01:31:21,810
insulted to their core by an offer like

2497
01:31:20,040 --> 01:31:22,920
that now they're willing to play along

2498
01:31:21,810 --> 01:31:24,450
with it because they're gonna do the

2499
01:31:22,920 --> 01:31:26,340
same thing with you now well that's

2500
01:31:24,450 --> 01:31:27,810
exactly and it's like yeah yeah I know

2501
01:31:26,340 --> 01:31:29,280
you're not gonna commit to me so that

2502
01:31:27,810 --> 01:31:31,530
means you don't value me or our

2503
01:31:29,280 --> 01:31:33,300
relationship above everything else but

2504
01:31:31,530 --> 01:31:34,560
as long as I get to escape if I need to

2505
01:31:33,300 --> 01:31:36,510
then I'm willing to put up with that

2506
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:38,250
it's like that's a hell of a thing I

2507
01:31:36,510 --> 01:31:40,020
mean you might think how stupid is it to

2508
01:31:38,250 --> 01:31:41,490
shackle yourself to someone it's like

2509
01:31:40,020 --> 01:31:43,530
it's stupid man there's no doubt about

2510
01:31:41,490 --> 01:31:46,140
that but compared to the alternatives

2511
01:31:43,530 --> 01:31:48,420
it's pretty damn good because without

2512
01:31:46,140 --> 01:31:50,910
that shackling there are things you will

2513
01:31:48,420 --> 01:31:53,430
never ever learn because you'll avoid

2514
01:31:50,910 --> 01:31:54,450
them you can always leave and if you can

2515
01:31:53,430 --> 01:31:56,160
leave then you don't have to tell each

2516
01:31:54,450 --> 01:31:57,780
other the truth it's as simple as that

2517
01:31:56,160 --> 01:31:58,920
because you can just leave and then you

2518
01:31:57,780 --> 01:32:08,040
don't have anyone you can tell the truth

2519
01:31:58,920 --> 01:32:10,290
to so there's some representations of

2520
01:32:08,040 --> 01:32:12,240
the idea of the original it's not this

2521
01:32:10,290 --> 01:32:15,300
isn't all Adam this is this is an old

2522
01:32:12,240 --> 01:32:16,610
Chinese symbol I think it's Fuxi and new

2523
01:32:15,300 --> 01:32:18,600
although I think I have the

2524
01:32:16,610 --> 01:32:20,600
pronunciation wrong but it's really cool

2525
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:23,490
see it's see the snakes down here

2526
01:32:20,600 --> 01:32:26,250
they're kind of like DNA symbol which I

2527
01:32:23,490 --> 01:32:28,680
find very interesting and so that's the

2528
01:32:26,250 --> 01:32:30,330
original cosmic serpent that's there to

2529
01:32:28,680 --> 01:32:31,890
the potential out of which that emerges

2530
01:32:30,330 --> 01:32:34,050
and then that's the differentiation of

2531
01:32:31,890 --> 01:32:36,690
that into male and female and so that's

2532
01:32:34,050 --> 01:32:38,100
like the predatory unknown that's one

2533
01:32:36,690 --> 01:32:40,140
way of thinking about it that's the most

2534
01:32:38,100 --> 01:32:41,460
fundamental conception of mankind is

2535
01:32:40,140 --> 01:32:43,800
something like that is the predatory

2536
01:32:41,460 --> 01:32:45,630
unknown and then the bifurcation of that

2537
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:47,460
into the two fundamental cognitive

2538
01:32:45,630 --> 01:32:49,290
elements of human perception masculine

2539
01:32:47,460 --> 01:32:51,300
and female and you see the same thing

2540
01:32:49,290 --> 01:32:53,640
here this is Chinese this is Egyptian

2541
01:32:51,300 --> 01:32:55,140
also extraordinarily old it's the it's

2542
01:32:53,640 --> 01:32:57,320
the great serpent that underlies

2543
01:32:55,140 --> 01:32:57,320
everything

2544
01:32:57,650 --> 01:33:02,460
forgetting itself into Isis queen of the

2545
01:33:00,330 --> 01:33:05,310
underworld and Osiris king of the king

2546
01:33:02,460 --> 01:33:06,690
of king of King Pharaoh king of order

2547
01:33:05,310 --> 01:33:08,940
you see the same thing in the old

2548
01:33:06,690 --> 01:33:10,230
alchemical symbol I love this one does

2549
01:33:08,940 --> 01:33:11,850
it looks quite a lot like the little

2550
01:33:10,230 --> 01:33:13,920
thing that Harry Potter chases around eh

2551
01:33:11,850 --> 01:33:15,780
yeah and that's not accidental by the

2552
01:33:13,920 --> 01:33:18,150
way because the seeker is the same the

2553
01:33:15,780 --> 01:33:20,010
thing that chases this and the seeker

2554
01:33:18,150 --> 01:33:21,900
that chases this and catches it wins and

2555
01:33:20,010 --> 01:33:23,550
that's a really old idea and how they

2556
01:33:21,900 --> 01:33:25,230
held JK Rowling knew that I cannot

2557
01:33:23,550 --> 01:33:27,870
figure out because that is a very very

2558
01:33:25,230 --> 01:33:29,390
archaic symbol arcane symbol on Google

2559
01:33:27,870 --> 01:33:31,880
it's called the rau

2560
01:33:29,390 --> 01:33:33,530
to chaos and the only reference to the

2561
01:33:31,880 --> 01:33:37,670
round chaos that I can find on Google is

2562
01:33:33,530 --> 01:33:39,440
on my web page and so I have no idea how

2563
01:33:37,670 --> 01:33:41,180
Rowling came up with that I mean I know

2564
01:33:39,440 --> 01:33:43,460
she looked at a lot of old texts but the

2565
01:33:41,180 --> 01:33:45,740
idea that if you play the meta game and

2566
01:33:43,460 --> 01:33:47,300
you catch this you win all the games is

2567
01:33:45,740 --> 01:33:48,830
exactly right and that and that's the

2568
01:33:47,300 --> 01:33:51,980
motif for what's the name of that

2569
01:33:48,830 --> 01:33:53,390
Quidditch yeah so there's the potential

2570
01:33:51,980 --> 01:33:54,890
that's like the potential out of which

2571
01:33:53,390 --> 01:33:56,750
God made the world at the beginning of

2572
01:33:54,890 --> 01:33:58,460
time and what emerges out of that is

2573
01:33:56,750 --> 01:34:00,140
some kind of that's the dragon you know

2574
01:33:58,460 --> 01:34:01,760
that in the dragon fight that's partly

2575
01:34:00,140 --> 01:34:03,740
the serpent that's in the Garden of Eden

2576
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:05,740
and then that's the manifestation of

2577
01:34:03,740 --> 01:34:09,620
masculine and feminine out of that

2578
01:34:05,740 --> 01:34:12,050
potential predatory unknown masculine

2579
01:34:09,620 --> 01:34:13,700
and feminine it's like a single it's

2580
01:34:12,050 --> 01:34:15,920
like a single representation of the

2581
01:34:13,700 --> 01:34:19,160
evolutionary history of human cognitive

2582
01:34:15,920 --> 01:34:21,470
consciousness so cool and that's also an

2583
01:34:19,160 --> 01:34:23,710
image of the ideal it's the union of Sun

2584
01:34:21,470 --> 01:34:26,360
and Moon and it's this hyper creature

2585
01:34:23,710 --> 01:34:28,040
hermaphroditic that's also the Adam and

2586
01:34:26,360 --> 01:34:29,840
Eve that existed at the beginning of

2587
01:34:28,040 --> 01:34:32,330
time before the fall and it's the

2588
01:34:29,840 --> 01:34:33,920
purpose of marriage all of that as a

2589
01:34:32,330 --> 01:34:36,380
sacrament all of that in these images

2590
01:34:33,920 --> 01:34:40,400
it's just absolutely unbelievable what

2591
01:34:36,380 --> 01:34:41,990
images can pack into them and there's

2592
01:34:40,400 --> 01:34:48,710
some more classical representations of

2593
01:34:41,990 --> 01:34:50,000
Eve being extracted from Adam and this

2594
01:34:48,710 --> 01:34:51,470
is a cool line and they were both naked

2595
01:34:50,000 --> 01:34:52,600
the man and his wife and we're not

2596
01:34:51,470 --> 01:34:55,700
ashamed

2597
01:34:52,600 --> 01:34:57,470
well that see someone who wrote that

2598
01:34:55,700 --> 01:34:58,880
would only write that like that if they

2599
01:34:57,470 --> 01:35:00,080
were surprised that they weren't ashamed

2600
01:34:58,880 --> 01:35:01,940
because why would you point it out

2601
01:35:00,080 --> 01:35:04,790
otherwise and so there's this intimation

2602
01:35:01,940 --> 01:35:07,310
that of two things number one is there

2603
01:35:04,790 --> 01:35:08,600
was a point at time in time when human

2604
01:35:07,310 --> 01:35:10,280
beings were naked and they weren't

2605
01:35:08,600 --> 01:35:12,290
ashamed of it and there is a point of

2606
01:35:10,280 --> 01:35:14,420
time which is now where they're naked

2607
01:35:12,290 --> 01:35:16,190
and they are ashamed of it and then the

2608
01:35:14,420 --> 01:35:18,800
question is well what's the association

2609
01:35:16,190 --> 01:35:21,670
with nakedness and shame and that's

2610
01:35:18,800 --> 01:35:24,020
often given a sexual connotation in in

2611
01:35:21,670 --> 01:35:26,270
classic interpretations of the Adam and

2612
01:35:24,020 --> 01:35:28,670
Eve story because of its association

2613
01:35:26,270 --> 01:35:31,490
with nudity I presume but I think it's a

2614
01:35:28,670 --> 01:35:34,960
lot more complicated than that so you

2615
01:35:31,490 --> 01:35:37,040
think I know I would notice my daughter

2616
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:38,450
she probably won't be very happy that

2617
01:35:37,040 --> 01:35:40,820
I'm revealing this in this lecture but

2618
01:35:38,450 --> 01:35:43,159
my daughter was never really concerned

2619
01:35:40,820 --> 01:35:44,300
about nudity when she was a little kid

2620
01:35:43,159 --> 01:35:46,999
is all the same to her one way or

2621
01:35:44,300 --> 01:35:49,639
another but my son by the time he was

2622
01:35:46,999 --> 01:35:51,769
three man that kid was private he his

2623
01:35:49,639 --> 01:35:53,030
his bedroom door was shut the bathroom

2624
01:35:51,769 --> 01:35:54,559
door was shut it was like get the hell

2625
01:35:53,030 --> 01:35:56,510
out of here and that seemed to just

2626
01:35:54,559 --> 01:35:58,130
happen of its own accord and you know we

2627
01:35:56,510 --> 01:35:59,419
had two children and one was like that

2628
01:35:58,130 --> 01:36:00,769
and the other one wasn't I didn't think

2629
01:35:59,419 --> 01:36:02,389
we had much to do with it at all but it

2630
01:36:00,769 --> 01:36:04,459
was really fascinating to watch that

2631
01:36:02,389 --> 01:36:07,369
emerge in him and you know that that

2632
01:36:04,459 --> 01:36:08,599
sense of of self-consciousness does seem

2633
01:36:07,369 --> 01:36:10,309
to emerge in children somewhere around

2634
01:36:08,599 --> 01:36:11,929
the age of three and you know that's

2635
01:36:10,309 --> 01:36:13,309
generally also when we start thinking

2636
01:36:11,929 --> 01:36:14,929
that maybe having your baby wander

2637
01:36:13,309 --> 01:36:16,909
around naked on a beach isn't exactly

2638
01:36:14,929 --> 01:36:18,679
the best idea there's there's there's

2639
01:36:16,909 --> 01:36:20,539
something like that it's the nudity and

2640
01:36:18,679 --> 01:36:22,729
children is generally okay under some

2641
01:36:20,539 --> 01:36:25,809
circumstances in public display we seem

2642
01:36:22,729 --> 01:36:29,269
to think of that as merely as acceptable

2643
01:36:25,809 --> 01:36:30,949
why I don't know why it stops being

2644
01:36:29,269 --> 01:36:33,169
acceptable well that has something to do

2645
01:36:30,949 --> 01:36:35,269
with sexuality obviously but it's a very

2646
01:36:33,169 --> 01:36:37,400
complicated phenomena but you know that

2647
01:36:35,269 --> 01:36:39,380
whole nudity thing is then is a very

2648
01:36:37,400 --> 01:36:40,849
complicated thing I mean first of all

2649
01:36:39,380 --> 01:36:44,119
people are kind of strange because we're

2650
01:36:40,849 --> 01:36:46,789
hairless roughly you know compared to

2651
01:36:44,119 --> 01:36:48,499
most animals and we don't know why that

2652
01:36:46,789 --> 01:36:49,760
is some people think it's because we

2653
01:36:48,499 --> 01:36:51,320
lost our heroine we were wandering

2654
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:52,909
around in the day in the desert running

2655
01:36:51,320 --> 01:36:54,499
around in Africa because we're really

2656
01:36:52,909 --> 01:36:57,199
really good runners we can run down

2657
01:36:54,499 --> 01:36:58,579
animals say like a human being in good

2658
01:36:57,199 --> 01:37:01,459
shape can run a horse to death in a week

2659
01:36:58,579 --> 01:37:03,679
we can really run man and a lot of our

2660
01:37:01,459 --> 01:37:04,010
ancestors the Kalahari Bushmen still do

2661
01:37:03,679 --> 01:37:06,709
this

2662
01:37:04,010 --> 01:37:08,959
they just run an animal for like it

2663
01:37:06,709 --> 01:37:10,880
until it dies and that Bushman doesn't

2664
01:37:08,959 --> 01:37:12,110
die I mean they also sometimes shoot

2665
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:13,729
them with poison arrows but they can

2666
01:37:12,110 --> 01:37:15,829
just run them till they die so we have

2667
01:37:13,729 --> 01:37:16,999
tremendous endurance and you and you

2668
01:37:15,829 --> 01:37:18,260
have to be able to get rid of a lot of

2669
01:37:16,999 --> 01:37:20,300
heat if you're gonna run around in the

2670
01:37:18,260 --> 01:37:22,039
desert so we don't have much hair that's

2671
01:37:20,300 --> 01:37:23,869
one explanation and Buckminster Fuller

2672
01:37:22,039 --> 01:37:25,729
had an interesting explanation which was

2673
01:37:23,869 --> 01:37:27,499
he thinks that at some point during our

2674
01:37:25,729 --> 01:37:28,999
evolution we spend a lot of time near

2675
01:37:27,499 --> 01:37:31,130
the water and so we're like fish Apes

2676
01:37:28,999 --> 01:37:32,539
something like that well you know we

2677
01:37:31,130 --> 01:37:33,979
like to be on the beach and there's lots

2678
01:37:32,539 --> 01:37:35,059
of food there and we like to swim and

2679
01:37:33,979 --> 01:37:38,030
we're really good at swimming for

2680
01:37:35,059 --> 01:37:40,669
terrestrial creatures and we cry salt

2681
01:37:38,030 --> 01:37:42,499
tears like some seagoing creatures - and

2682
01:37:40,669 --> 01:37:44,780
women have a layer of subcutaneous fat

2683
01:37:42,499 --> 01:37:46,729
like some seagoing creatures - and we

2684
01:37:44,780 --> 01:37:49,369
have kind of our feet are which are very

2685
01:37:46,729 --> 01:37:50,929
odd things are kind of good for flapping

2686
01:37:49,369 --> 01:37:53,059
in the water although we can also walk

2687
01:37:50,929 --> 01:37:56,989
with them and so he thought that maybe

2688
01:37:53,059 --> 01:37:58,849
that adaptation was to - water exists

2689
01:37:56,989 --> 01:38:00,440
like seals and so forth like we kind of

2690
01:37:58,849 --> 01:38:03,349
went back to the ocean but not quite and

2691
01:38:00,440 --> 01:38:05,480
so but anyways the evolution of that

2692
01:38:03,349 --> 01:38:07,820
hairlessness is an interesting thing but

2693
01:38:05,480 --> 01:38:09,440
it certainly does make us exposed to the

2694
01:38:07,820 --> 01:38:11,599
world in a way that animals that have a

2695
01:38:09,440 --> 01:38:13,610
covering of fur aren't and then we're

2696
01:38:11,599 --> 01:38:15,679
upright which is very strange because

2697
01:38:13,610 --> 01:38:18,199
most animals aren't there on all fours

2698
01:38:15,679 --> 01:38:21,289
and so they're very vulnerable parts are

2699
01:38:18,199 --> 01:38:22,849
protected and not exposed to view and

2700
01:38:21,289 --> 01:38:26,539
then of course when you're standing up

2701
01:38:22,849 --> 01:38:28,820
nude your your your visit let's call it

2702
01:38:26,539 --> 01:38:32,059
your psychophysiological quality is on

2703
01:38:28,820 --> 01:38:33,440
painful display right and people

2704
01:38:32,059 --> 01:38:35,239
complain about that all the time you

2705
01:38:33,440 --> 01:38:37,219
know if you look at the feminist tack

2706
01:38:35,239 --> 01:38:40,119
for example on beauty the idea that

2707
01:38:37,219 --> 01:38:42,739
women have eating disorders is directly

2708
01:38:40,119 --> 01:38:43,969
attributed to the presence of too many

2709
01:38:42,739 --> 01:38:46,249
beautiful women on the cover of

2710
01:38:43,969 --> 01:38:48,409
magazines something like that even

2711
01:38:46,249 --> 01:38:49,579
though women buy those magazines and

2712
01:38:48,409 --> 01:38:51,559
they're attracted to the band their mood

2713
01:38:49,579 --> 01:38:54,739
goes up when they purchase them and if

2714
01:38:51,559 --> 01:38:56,090
the if the stimulus was negative the

2715
01:38:54,739 --> 01:38:58,249
women would avoid the magazines and not

2716
01:38:56,090 --> 01:39:01,429
buy them so as a theory it's a very very

2717
01:38:58,249 --> 01:39:03,349
bad one but it's still the case that you

2718
01:39:01,429 --> 01:39:05,030
know it's still the case that standards

2719
01:39:03,349 --> 01:39:06,920
of beauty shame people and that's for

2720
01:39:05,030 --> 01:39:08,900
sure and everyone because if you're not

2721
01:39:06,920 --> 01:39:12,949
ugly now man you're gonna be at some

2722
01:39:08,900 --> 01:39:14,539
point in your life so that's kind of a

2723
01:39:12,949 --> 01:39:17,210
rough thing to contend with right it's

2724
01:39:14,539 --> 01:39:18,769
it's a rough thing to to know that that

2725
01:39:17,210 --> 01:39:20,119
there's an ideal that you could be and

2726
01:39:18,769 --> 01:39:21,980
maybe even once were that you're not

2727
01:39:20,119 --> 01:39:24,409
going to be for long or knit orden or

2728
01:39:21,980 --> 01:39:26,780
never were and it's really an appalling

2729
01:39:24,409 --> 01:39:28,999
issue because I think it's harder on

2730
01:39:26,780 --> 01:39:31,940
women because women are judged by men

2731
01:39:28,999 --> 01:39:34,400
more for their but for their youth and

2732
01:39:31,940 --> 01:39:36,260
fertility that's how it turns out from

2733
01:39:34,400 --> 01:39:37,610
the evolutionary point of view men are

2734
01:39:36,260 --> 01:39:40,130
judged more on their socioeconomic

2735
01:39:37,610 --> 01:39:42,499
status by women it's harsh both ways but

2736
01:39:40,130 --> 01:39:46,249
so anyways it's you know it's a terrible

2737
01:39:42,499 --> 01:39:49,309
thing to to carry the knowledge with you

2738
01:39:46,249 --> 01:39:51,469
that you're exposed to the most serious

2739
01:39:49,309 --> 01:39:52,969
possible evaluation of the quality of

2740
01:39:51,469 --> 01:39:55,579
your being that you can possibly be

2741
01:39:52,969 --> 01:39:57,769
exposed to all the time and that that's

2742
01:39:55,579 --> 01:39:59,570
further amplified if you're without

2743
01:39:57,769 --> 01:40:01,280
clothing and so part of clothing is

2744
01:39:59,570 --> 01:40:03,880
protection but a tremendous amount of it

2745
01:40:01,280 --> 01:40:06,170
is merely stopping other people from

2746
01:40:03,880 --> 01:40:10,520
evaluating you too harshly all the time

2747
01:40:06,170 --> 01:40:15,020
it just gets in the way so and

2748
01:40:10,520 --> 01:40:16,970
this store this this story makes the

2749
01:40:15,020 --> 01:40:18,800
case that at some point we weren't like

2750
01:40:16,970 --> 01:40:20,630
that well animals aren't like that so it

2751
01:40:18,800 --> 01:40:22,460
seems perfectly plausible that at some

2752
01:40:20,630 --> 01:40:24,680
point we weren't like that but at some

2753
01:40:22,460 --> 01:40:26,330
point that changed and they were both

2754
01:40:24,680 --> 01:40:30,530
naked the man and his wife and we're not

2755
01:40:26,330 --> 01:40:31,940
ashamed how the serpent was more subtle

2756
01:40:30,530 --> 01:40:34,550
than any beast of the field which the

2757
01:40:31,940 --> 01:40:36,740
Lord God had made and he said unto the

2758
01:40:34,550 --> 01:40:38,870
woman yea hath God said you shall not

2759
01:40:36,740 --> 01:40:43,040
eat of every tree of the garden I like

2760
01:40:38,870 --> 01:40:46,400
this this is remember who did the edging

2761
01:40:43,040 --> 01:40:48,680
who is it DeRay yeah DeRay exactly he

2762
01:40:46,400 --> 01:40:50,630
dorade did etchings for Paradise Lost

2763
01:40:48,680 --> 01:40:52,700
that are absolutely remarkable and this

2764
01:40:50,630 --> 01:40:54,860
is Satan and this is the snake here and

2765
01:40:52,700 --> 01:40:56,690
of course in in in the Genesis story

2766
01:40:54,860 --> 01:40:58,820
Satan is weirdly associated with the

2767
01:40:56,690 --> 01:41:01,310
snake and I'll tell you that's a that's

2768
01:40:58,820 --> 01:41:03,710
a that's a tough one to sort out because

2769
01:41:01,310 --> 01:41:05,840
in the story of Adam and Eve there's no

2770
01:41:03,710 --> 01:41:09,380
indication whatsoever that the serpent

2771
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:11,630
who tempts Eve is also Satan the author

2772
01:41:09,380 --> 01:41:14,060
of all evil and how in the world those

2773
01:41:11,630 --> 01:41:16,310
two stories got tangled together well I

2774
01:41:14,060 --> 01:41:17,930
think I figured that out and I'm gonna

2775
01:41:16,310 --> 01:41:19,220
tell you that tonight but it took a very

2776
01:41:17,930 --> 01:41:21,530
long time to figure it out and it's

2777
01:41:19,220 --> 01:41:23,090
absolutely it's so bloody brilliant I

2778
01:41:21,530 --> 01:41:25,540
just can't believe that people figured

2779
01:41:23,090 --> 01:41:28,280
it out it's so it's so unbelievably

2780
01:41:25,540 --> 01:41:30,260
spectacularly brilliant and that's a

2781
01:41:28,280 --> 01:41:31,520
that's a an intimation of that idea

2782
01:41:30,260 --> 01:41:34,490
right that there's a kinship between

2783
01:41:31,520 --> 01:41:36,320
these two things so anyways the serpents

2784
01:41:34,490 --> 01:41:38,030
more subtle than any beast of the field

2785
01:41:36,320 --> 01:41:39,890
subtle is an interesting word this is

2786
01:41:38,030 --> 01:41:42,380
from the oxford english dictionary

2787
01:41:39,890 --> 01:41:44,150
so because will amplify the word a bit

2788
01:41:42,380 --> 01:41:45,890
this is what you do in Union dream

2789
01:41:44,150 --> 01:41:47,840
interpretation for example is to kind of

2790
01:41:45,890 --> 01:41:49,570
look at the connotations of the concepts

2791
01:41:47,840 --> 01:41:52,310
that are associated with the dream

2792
01:41:49,570 --> 01:41:55,340
subtle of a person or animal and action

2793
01:41:52,310 --> 01:41:56,540
behavior crafty cunning sly treacherous

2794
01:41:55,340 --> 01:41:58,340
so it's something that sort of sneaks

2795
01:41:56,540 --> 01:42:01,040
along right it's not something that you

2796
01:41:58,340 --> 01:42:03,980
really pick up on that easily of a look

2797
01:42:01,040 --> 01:42:07,670
or glance sly furtive surreptitious of a

2798
01:42:03,980 --> 01:42:09,710
person skillful expert clever of a work

2799
01:42:07,670 --> 01:42:11,960
of art mechanical device cleverly made

2800
01:42:09,710 --> 01:42:15,050
or designed ingenious well that's I

2801
01:42:11,960 --> 01:42:17,000
think that's all fairly all those terms

2802
01:42:15,050 --> 01:42:18,770
so far are fairly well attributed to

2803
01:42:17,000 --> 01:42:20,960
snakes I mean they are very cool things

2804
01:42:18,770 --> 01:42:22,340
and and they are very well designed and

2805
01:42:20,960 --> 01:42:23,880
they're quite remarkable and they're

2806
01:42:22,340 --> 01:42:26,610
also very subtle

2807
01:42:23,880 --> 01:42:29,340
on the nature of or involving careful

2808
01:42:26,610 --> 01:42:31,230
discrimination of fine points or fine

2809
01:42:29,340 --> 01:42:39,600
points difficult to understand and

2810
01:42:31,230 --> 01:42:41,580
abstruse of a person the mind or

2811
01:42:39,600 --> 01:42:43,290
intellectual activity intellectual

2812
01:42:41,580 --> 01:42:45,060
activity characterized by wisdom or

2813
01:42:43,290 --> 01:42:46,440
perceptiveness discriminating discerning

2814
01:42:45,060 --> 01:42:50,420
and truth that's interesting because

2815
01:42:46,440 --> 01:42:52,890
Milton's Satan is also the intellect and

2816
01:42:50,420 --> 01:42:54,600
you know you see that very often you

2817
01:42:52,890 --> 01:42:56,340
know it's so often the bad guys an evil

2818
01:42:54,600 --> 01:42:58,080
scientist right and there's something

2819
01:42:56,340 --> 01:42:59,370
about and you see the same thing in the

2820
01:42:58,080 --> 01:43:01,560
Lion King with scar

2821
01:42:59,370 --> 01:43:03,420
I mean scar is an intellect and arrogant

2822
01:43:01,560 --> 01:43:06,270
deceitful intellect he's there's nothing

2823
01:43:03,420 --> 01:43:08,160
stupid about scar he's not wise but he's

2824
01:43:06,270 --> 01:43:09,960
the he's the evil voice that's always

2825
01:43:08,160 --> 01:43:11,550
whispering in the Kings ear and that's

2826
01:43:09,960 --> 01:43:14,100
associated with the pride of the

2827
01:43:11,550 --> 01:43:15,750
intellect and the Catholics had warned

2828
01:43:14,100 --> 01:43:18,150
people warned humanity about the pride

2829
01:43:15,750 --> 01:43:19,950
of the intellect for centuries that's

2830
01:43:18,150 --> 01:43:21,750
partly what produced somewhat of this

2831
01:43:19,950 --> 01:43:23,370
Gizem between Catholicism and science

2832
01:43:21,750 --> 01:43:25,800
although that's much overstated if you

2833
01:43:23,370 --> 01:43:27,720
look at the historical record the idea

2834
01:43:25,800 --> 01:43:30,600
was that the intellect has its own

2835
01:43:27,720 --> 01:43:32,460
particular it's a remarkable faculty

2836
01:43:30,600 --> 01:43:33,930
let's say it's the highest angel in

2837
01:43:32,460 --> 01:43:36,270
God's heavenly kingdom that's the way

2838
01:43:33,930 --> 01:43:37,830
that Milton portrayed it but it's also

2839
01:43:36,270 --> 01:43:40,530
the thing that can go most terribly

2840
01:43:37,830 --> 01:43:42,540
wrong because intellect the intellect

2841
01:43:40,530 --> 01:43:44,880
can become arrogant about its own

2842
01:43:42,540 --> 01:43:46,560
existence and accomplishments and it can

2843
01:43:44,880 --> 01:43:47,640
fall in love with its own products and

2844
01:43:46,560 --> 01:43:49,650
that's what happens when your

2845
01:43:47,640 --> 01:43:51,810
ideological II possessed because you end

2846
01:43:49,650 --> 01:43:53,730
up with a Dogma like say a human

2847
01:43:51,810 --> 01:43:55,590
constructed Dogma in Solzhenitsyn's

2848
01:43:53,730 --> 01:43:59,550
words that possesses you completely of

2849
01:43:55,590 --> 01:44:01,200
which you believe is 100% right right so

2850
01:43:59,550 --> 01:44:03,810
it eradicate the necessity for anything

2851
01:44:01,200 --> 01:44:05,850
transcendent and so that's the subtle

2852
01:44:03,810 --> 01:44:07,800
element of the intellect that's

2853
01:44:05,850 --> 01:44:10,950
associated symbolically with the snake

2854
01:44:07,800 --> 01:44:13,440
in the garden of paradise of a feeling

2855
01:44:10,950 --> 01:44:15,000
scent sensation acute and keen involving

2856
01:44:13,440 --> 01:44:16,950
distinctions that are finer delicate

2857
01:44:15,000 --> 01:44:18,900
especially to such an extent as to be

2858
01:44:16,950 --> 01:44:21,810
difficult to discern or analyze also

2859
01:44:18,900 --> 01:44:24,380
almost imperceptible and elusive having

2860
01:44:21,810 --> 01:44:28,050
little thickness or breadth thin fine

2861
01:44:24,380 --> 01:44:31,200
subdial matter now historical rarefied

2862
01:44:28,050 --> 01:44:33,360
matter barely there at all and the woman

2863
01:44:31,200 --> 01:44:35,340
said unto the serpent we may eat of the

2864
01:44:33,360 --> 01:44:36,450
fruit of the trees of the garden but of

2865
01:44:35,340 --> 01:44:37,409
the fruit of the tree which is in the

2866
01:44:36,450 --> 01:44:39,570
midst of the garden

2867
01:44:37,409 --> 01:44:41,820
office goddess said he shall not eat of

2868
01:44:39,570 --> 01:44:44,729
it neither shall you touch it lest you

2869
01:44:41,820 --> 01:44:47,249
die and the serpent said to the woman ye

2870
01:44:44,729 --> 01:44:49,229
shall not surely die for God doth know

2871
01:44:47,249 --> 01:44:50,760
in the day that you eat thereof then

2872
01:44:49,229 --> 01:44:52,969
your eyes shall be opened and you shall

2873
01:44:50,760 --> 01:44:56,610
be as God's knowing good and evil

2874
01:44:52,969 --> 01:44:58,679
sneaky subtle it's a nice story a the

2875
01:44:56,610 --> 01:45:01,590
first thing is the for instant the

2876
01:44:58,679 --> 01:45:04,260
instant implication is well you can't

2877
01:45:01,590 --> 01:45:05,999
trust God so that's pretty sneaky and

2878
01:45:04,260 --> 01:45:08,099
the next is well he's trying to he's

2879
01:45:05,999 --> 01:45:09,479
trying to pull a fast one on you and the

2880
01:45:08,099 --> 01:45:11,550
next one is he's trying to do that

2881
01:45:09,479 --> 01:45:13,019
because he's jealous and he doesn't want

2882
01:45:11,550 --> 01:45:15,360
you to know things that he knows because

2883
01:45:13,019 --> 01:45:16,800
that wouldn't be so good and he's lying

2884
01:45:15,360 --> 01:45:19,590
to you anyways because you're not going

2885
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:21,360
to die and if you eat it

2886
01:45:19,590 --> 01:45:23,309
contrary to what you've been informed

2887
01:45:21,360 --> 01:45:24,510
then all that's going to happen is your

2888
01:45:23,309 --> 01:45:26,369
eyes will be open and you'll be like

2889
01:45:24,510 --> 01:45:28,919
God's knowing good and evil that sounds

2890
01:45:26,369 --> 01:45:31,320
pretty damn good so you know and I I

2891
01:45:28,919 --> 01:45:34,169
mean Eve what does she know you know

2892
01:45:31,320 --> 01:45:35,789
it's no wonder she's susceptible to such

2893
01:45:34,169 --> 01:45:37,860
blandishments and it's quite interesting

2894
01:45:35,789 --> 01:45:39,659
too because Adam and Eve God tells Adam

2895
01:45:37,860 --> 01:45:42,989
and Eve not to eat the damn fruit but

2896
01:45:39,659 --> 01:45:44,610
they never promise not to write so they

2897
01:45:42,989 --> 01:45:46,409
haven't promised they've just been told

2898
01:45:44,610 --> 01:45:47,820
to and well should they be obedient

2899
01:45:46,409 --> 01:45:49,619
well how obedient do you want your

2900
01:45:47,820 --> 01:45:51,150
children to be you want them to be

2901
01:45:49,619 --> 01:45:52,829
obedient enough so they don't get hurt

2902
01:45:51,150 --> 01:45:53,969
but disobedient enough so that they go

2903
01:45:52,829 --> 01:45:55,650
out in the world and do something

2904
01:45:53,969 --> 01:45:57,389
courageous and they break some rules

2905
01:45:55,650 --> 01:45:59,639
that they learn some things and so you

2906
01:45:57,389 --> 01:46:02,189
know it's it's it's a very paradoxical

2907
01:45:59,639 --> 01:46:05,189
story anyways the serpent ones that wins

2908
01:46:02,189 --> 01:46:12,090
this round man and so Eve pays attention

2909
01:46:05,189 --> 01:46:14,969
to the snake so again we have the same

2910
01:46:12,090 --> 01:46:17,249
set of images right we have Adam and we

2911
01:46:14,969 --> 01:46:18,959
have Eve we have this tree and we have

2912
01:46:17,249 --> 01:46:20,820
this strange serpent that's a

2913
01:46:18,959 --> 01:46:23,519
dragon-like form they're a sphinx like

2914
01:46:20,820 --> 01:46:25,320
form that's associated with the tree the

2915
01:46:23,519 --> 01:46:27,179
snakes eternally associated with the

2916
01:46:25,320 --> 01:46:29,130
tree well the snake was eternally

2917
01:46:27,179 --> 01:46:30,809
associated with the tree we spent god

2918
01:46:29,130 --> 01:46:34,679
only knows how many tens of millions of

2919
01:46:30,809 --> 01:46:37,050
years as tree dwelling primates and the

2920
01:46:34,679 --> 01:46:40,159
primary or one of our primary predators

2921
01:46:37,050 --> 01:46:44,820
we had three primary predators snakes

2922
01:46:40,159 --> 01:46:46,349
birds cats and so the snake has been

2923
01:46:44,820 --> 01:46:48,780
associated with the tree for a very very

2924
01:46:46,349 --> 01:46:51,090
long time and the lesson the snake tells

2925
01:46:48,780 --> 01:46:52,739
people is you bloody well better wake up

2926
01:46:51,090 --> 01:46:54,329
or something you don't like we'll get

2927
01:46:52,739 --> 01:46:56,010
you and who's going to be more

2928
01:46:54,329 --> 01:46:58,050
susceptible susceptible to paying

2929
01:46:56,010 --> 01:47:00,300
attention to the snake and that's going

2930
01:46:58,050 --> 01:47:03,449
to be Eve and the reason for that is Eve

2931
01:47:00,300 --> 01:47:06,989
has offspring and there's nothing

2932
01:47:03,449 --> 01:47:08,179
tastier to a snake than a child and so

2933
01:47:06,989 --> 01:47:10,469
Eve had every reason to be

2934
01:47:08,179 --> 01:47:11,940
self-conscious and neurotic and women

2935
01:47:10,469 --> 01:47:13,409
are more self-conscious and neurotic

2936
01:47:11,940 --> 01:47:15,840
than men by quite a substantial amount

2937
01:47:13,409 --> 01:47:17,909
and that's true cross culturally and in

2938
01:47:15,840 --> 01:47:19,889
the emerges at puberty and part of the

2939
01:47:17,909 --> 01:47:21,630
reason is as far as we can tell is that

2940
01:47:19,889 --> 01:47:24,630
women are more sexually vulnerable

2941
01:47:21,630 --> 01:47:25,800
they're also smaller so that's a problem

2942
01:47:24,630 --> 01:47:28,260
if you're engaged in any physical

2943
01:47:25,800 --> 01:47:32,400
alteration but most importantly I think

2944
01:47:28,260 --> 01:47:34,380
is that why would you ever assume that a

2945
01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:37,469
human females nervous system is adapted

2946
01:47:34,380 --> 01:47:39,239
to her or her well-being why wouldn't

2947
01:47:37,469 --> 01:47:41,699
you assume instead that her nervous

2948
01:47:39,239 --> 01:47:44,219
system is adapted to the female infant

2949
01:47:41,699 --> 01:47:46,739
dyad because if it isn't then the

2950
01:47:44,219 --> 01:47:48,059
infant's die and so you might think well

2951
01:47:46,739 --> 01:47:49,949
women are way more susceptible to

2952
01:47:48,059 --> 01:47:51,900
depression and anxiety than men are

2953
01:47:49,949 --> 01:47:53,579
that's a hell of a burden to bear and

2954
01:47:51,900 --> 01:47:55,380
that's also true cross culturally by the

2955
01:47:53,579 --> 01:47:56,880
way and it also kicks in at puberty and

2956
01:47:55,380 --> 01:47:58,590
the biggest differences are in

2957
01:47:56,880 --> 01:48:00,800
Scandinavia for those of you who think

2958
01:47:58,590 --> 01:48:03,780
it's socio-cultural which it isn't

2959
01:48:00,800 --> 01:48:05,610
so but there's reasons for it you know

2960
01:48:03,780 --> 01:48:07,260
and it's also at puberty when men and

2961
01:48:05,610 --> 01:48:09,179
men and women start to become sexually

2962
01:48:07,260 --> 01:48:11,280
dimorphic in terms of size and men are

2963
01:48:09,179 --> 01:48:13,770
way more powerful in their upper bodies

2964
01:48:11,280 --> 01:48:15,179
it's incomparably more powerful and so

2965
01:48:13,770 --> 01:48:17,789
that makes them a lot more dangerous and

2966
01:48:15,179 --> 01:48:19,619
human human primary human defense

2967
01:48:17,789 --> 01:48:21,960
mechanism is punching like with

2968
01:48:19,619 --> 01:48:23,579
kangaroos for because there's some other

2969
01:48:21,960 --> 01:48:25,559
animals that punch chimps can punch too

2970
01:48:23,579 --> 01:48:27,119
but human beings it's a punch and most

2971
01:48:25,559 --> 01:48:29,159
of the force and that is upper body and

2972
01:48:27,119 --> 01:48:30,780
shoulder and so a woman's no match for a

2973
01:48:29,159 --> 01:48:31,500
man in a fight so she has every reason

2974
01:48:30,780 --> 01:48:33,449
to be nervous

2975
01:48:31,500 --> 01:48:35,369
especially when you add that to that her

2976
01:48:33,449 --> 01:48:36,570
additional sexual vulnerability and the

2977
01:48:35,369 --> 01:48:38,340
fact that she has to take care of

2978
01:48:36,570 --> 01:48:40,650
extraordinarily dependent infants were

2979
01:48:38,340 --> 01:48:42,960
extremely fragile for a very long period

2980
01:48:40,650 --> 01:48:45,150
of time and so she had every and women

2981
01:48:42,960 --> 01:48:46,650
are more self-conscious than men the

2982
01:48:45,150 --> 01:48:48,480
empirical literature on that is clear

2983
01:48:46,650 --> 01:48:50,039
it's associated with trait neuroticism

2984
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:52,170
because self-consciousness is actually

2985
01:48:50,039 --> 01:48:54,480
an unpleasant emotion who wants to be

2986
01:48:52,170 --> 01:48:55,889
self-conscious if I'm self-conscious on

2987
01:48:54,480 --> 01:48:57,630
the stage talking to you then all of a

2988
01:48:55,889 --> 01:48:59,280
sudden I can't even talk to you all I'm

2989
01:48:57,630 --> 01:49:00,599
doing is thinking about me and all the

2990
01:48:59,280 --> 01:49:01,530
things that are wrong with me and I fall

2991
01:49:00,599 --> 01:49:03,449
inside myself

2992
01:49:01,530 --> 01:49:04,889
it's like self-consciousness although

2993
01:49:03,449 --> 01:49:06,719
it's a great gift let's

2994
01:49:04,889 --> 01:49:11,789
is nothing Pleasant its associated

2995
01:49:06,719 --> 01:49:13,199
primarily with anxiety so we've had

2996
01:49:11,789 --> 01:49:15,419
every reason to pay attention to the

2997
01:49:13,199 --> 01:49:17,669
snake that's for sure I think I read

2998
01:49:15,419 --> 01:49:19,019
this week that among I can't remember

2999
01:49:17,669 --> 01:49:20,429
which tribes minute where it was

3000
01:49:19,019 --> 01:49:24,119
unfortunately although I did put a

3001
01:49:20,429 --> 01:49:28,619
footnote in my new book about this these

3002
01:49:24,119 --> 01:49:30,389
were jungle dwelling tribal people five

3003
01:49:28,619 --> 01:49:32,610
percent of the adults had been attacked

3004
01:49:30,389 --> 01:49:34,169
by a python and a substantial number of

3005
01:49:32,610 --> 01:49:37,559
children had been killed by them so

3006
01:49:34,169 --> 01:49:40,079
snake predation was no joke it shaped

3007
01:49:37,559 --> 01:49:42,269
our evolutionary past and still is no

3008
01:49:40,079 --> 01:49:44,760
joke in many places and so we're a tuned

3009
01:49:42,269 --> 01:49:47,610
to snakes and the thing is as lynn has

3010
01:49:44,760 --> 01:49:49,409
bel pointed out an anthropologist we are

3011
01:49:47,610 --> 01:49:51,030
really good at detecting the camouflage

3012
01:49:49,409 --> 01:49:53,719
patterns of snakes especially in the

3013
01:49:51,030 --> 01:49:56,010
lower half of our visual field and

3014
01:49:53,719 --> 01:49:58,010
there's evidence that part of the reason

3015
01:49:56,010 --> 01:50:00,360
that human beings have such acute vision

3016
01:49:58,010 --> 01:50:03,119
which means that our eyes open let's say

3017
01:50:00,360 --> 01:50:04,469
is because we were we co-evolved with

3018
01:50:03,119 --> 01:50:07,169
snakes and we learned how to see them

3019
01:50:04,469 --> 01:50:08,760
and then the price we paid for seeing

3020
01:50:07,169 --> 01:50:10,709
was that our brain grew because you need

3021
01:50:08,760 --> 01:50:12,360
a lot of brain to be able to see and the

3022
01:50:10,709 --> 01:50:14,010
consequence of our brain growing is one

3023
01:50:12,360 --> 01:50:15,749
day we woke up and discovered the future

3024
01:50:14,010 --> 01:50:17,729
and the future is where all the snakes

3025
01:50:15,749 --> 01:50:24,389
might live instead of where they live

3026
01:50:17,729 --> 01:50:26,189
right now so there's that the same thing

3027
01:50:24,389 --> 01:50:29,309
and the same so interesting again these

3028
01:50:26,189 --> 01:50:31,349
images you see in this one you have the

3029
01:50:29,309 --> 01:50:32,820
specter of death in the tree with the

3030
01:50:31,349 --> 01:50:34,829
snake and the fruit now fruit is

3031
01:50:32,820 --> 01:50:36,780
interesting - I already made the case

3032
01:50:34,829 --> 01:50:38,550
that there's a tight linkage between

3033
01:50:36,780 --> 01:50:40,229
what you eat and information right a

3034
01:50:38,550 --> 01:50:42,090
conceptual link as well as a practical

3035
01:50:40,229 --> 01:50:44,820
link but it's also the case that we can

3036
01:50:42,090 --> 01:50:46,559
see colors and the question is why and

3037
01:50:44,820 --> 01:50:49,199
the answer is because we evolved to see

3038
01:50:46,559 --> 01:50:51,419
ripe fruit so in the story of Adam and

3039
01:50:49,199 --> 01:50:53,249
Eve human beings are given vision by the

3040
01:50:51,419 --> 01:50:54,719
snake and the fruit and that turns out

3041
01:50:53,249 --> 01:50:56,999
to be correct

3042
01:50:54,719 --> 01:50:58,320
so isn't that something and then you

3043
01:50:56,999 --> 01:51:00,360
think what role do women play in

3044
01:50:58,320 --> 01:51:02,039
relationship to men well first they make

3045
01:51:00,360 --> 01:51:04,050
them self conscious let's not ever

3046
01:51:02,039 --> 01:51:06,269
forget about that because I would say

3047
01:51:04,050 --> 01:51:07,649
the primary role that women have in

3048
01:51:06,269 --> 01:51:09,449
relationship to man is to make them

3049
01:51:07,649 --> 01:51:11,909
self-conscious and men don't precisely

3050
01:51:09,449 --> 01:51:13,469
like that there's nothing that will make

3051
01:51:11,909 --> 01:51:15,989
a man more self-conscious than being

3052
01:51:13,469 --> 01:51:18,300
rejected and why because why is he

3053
01:51:15,989 --> 01:51:20,250
rejected well obviously

3054
01:51:18,300 --> 01:51:22,950
their nature in the guise of that

3055
01:51:20,250 --> 01:51:24,570
particular woman has said you're not so

3056
01:51:22,950 --> 01:51:25,800
bad for a friend but there's no reason

3057
01:51:24,570 --> 01:51:33,510
that your genetic material should

3058
01:51:25,800 --> 01:51:35,460
propagate itself into the future right

3059
01:51:33,510 --> 01:51:37,140
well it's not like men are exactly happy

3060
01:51:35,460 --> 01:51:39,510
about being me but made self-conscious

3061
01:51:37,140 --> 01:51:41,430
by women right it's a major source of

3062
01:51:39,510 --> 01:51:43,260
continual tension between men and women

3063
01:51:41,430 --> 01:51:44,730
and it's no wonder but it's also the

3064
01:51:43,260 --> 01:51:47,810
case and this is something really cool

3065
01:51:44,730 --> 01:51:52,350
and interesting to know you know we

3066
01:51:47,810 --> 01:51:55,290
divulged dyv divulged dye whatever

3067
01:51:52,350 --> 01:51:57,030
that's it diverged we diverged from the

3068
01:51:55,290 --> 01:51:58,770
common ancestor between us and

3069
01:51:57,030 --> 01:52:01,410
chimpanzees about six million years ago

3070
01:51:58,770 --> 01:52:03,390
here's why at least in part chimpanzee

3071
01:52:01,410 --> 01:52:06,150
females are non discriminant mater's

3072
01:52:03,390 --> 01:52:10,260
they'll mate with any male when they go

3073
01:52:06,150 --> 01:52:12,660
into heat which human females don't when

3074
01:52:10,260 --> 01:52:15,330
they go into heat then any male is

3075
01:52:12,660 --> 01:52:17,310
allowed access now the dominant males

3076
01:52:15,330 --> 01:52:18,660
chase the subordinate males away and so

3077
01:52:17,310 --> 01:52:20,160
the dominant males are more likely to

3078
01:52:18,660 --> 01:52:21,960
leave offspring but it's not because of

3079
01:52:20,160 --> 01:52:24,240
a female choice it's not the case with

3080
01:52:21,960 --> 01:52:26,610
human beings human females engage in

3081
01:52:24,240 --> 01:52:28,410
hypergamy and hypergamy is the ten this

3082
01:52:26,610 --> 01:52:31,770
is also true cross culturally and it's

3083
01:52:28,410 --> 01:52:33,330
also quite it's just as extensive in

3084
01:52:31,770 --> 01:52:35,460
Scandinavia not quite there's a bit of

3085
01:52:33,330 --> 01:52:37,260
attenuation but not much women mate

3086
01:52:35,460 --> 01:52:40,440
across and up dominance hierarchies

3087
01:52:37,260 --> 01:52:42,690
man-made across and down okay when that

3088
01:52:40,440 --> 01:52:45,030
has to be the case cuz it obviously it

3089
01:52:42,690 --> 01:52:46,760
has to work that way if one goes up the

3090
01:52:45,030 --> 01:52:50,640
other has to go down the socio-economic

3091
01:52:46,760 --> 01:52:52,980
status of a woman is almost determined

3092
01:52:50,640 --> 01:52:55,020
almost zero of her attractiveness

3093
01:52:52,980 --> 01:52:57,240
towards a man whereas the socio-economic

3094
01:52:55,020 --> 01:52:58,890
status of a man is a major determinant

3095
01:52:57,240 --> 01:53:00,630
of his attractiveness towards a woman

3096
01:52:58,890 --> 01:53:02,910
and it isn't as wealth either because

3097
01:53:00,630 --> 01:53:06,000
that's been tested it's his capacity to

3098
01:53:02,910 --> 01:53:07,530
generate and be productive and to share

3099
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:09,720
because that beats the hell out of

3100
01:53:07,530 --> 01:53:11,520
wealth wealth can disappear right but

3101
01:53:09,720 --> 01:53:14,010
the capacity to be productive and share

3102
01:53:11,520 --> 01:53:16,110
that's that's a much more important

3103
01:53:14,010 --> 01:53:17,670
element and why not be chosen on the

3104
01:53:16,110 --> 01:53:19,920
basis of that especially because women

3105
01:53:17,670 --> 01:53:21,720
have to have infants and infants make

3106
01:53:19,920 --> 01:53:23,970
the women dependent and the woman is

3107
01:53:21,720 --> 01:53:26,010
just looking logically rationally and

3108
01:53:23,970 --> 01:53:27,330
from an evolutionary perspective for

3109
01:53:26,010 --> 01:53:30,990
someone who's useful enough to give a

3110
01:53:27,330 --> 01:53:32,219
tool and a hat so women make intense

3111
01:53:30,990 --> 01:53:34,559
demands on men and it's

3112
01:53:32,219 --> 01:53:36,929
wonder but the thing is is that because

3113
01:53:34,559 --> 01:53:38,909
women engaged in hypergamy at least in

3114
01:53:36,929 --> 01:53:40,710
part we diverged quite rapidly from

3115
01:53:38,909 --> 01:53:42,900
chimpanzees because the selection

3116
01:53:40,710 --> 01:53:45,150
pressure that women placed on men

3117
01:53:42,900 --> 01:53:46,590
developed the entire species now there's

3118
01:53:45,150 --> 01:53:48,360
two things that happened as far as I

3119
01:53:46,590 --> 01:53:50,699
could tell the men competed for

3120
01:53:48,360 --> 01:53:53,460
competence let's say so the male

3121
01:53:50,699 --> 01:53:55,110
hierarchy is a mechanism that pushes the

3122
01:53:53,460 --> 01:53:58,320
best man to the top virtually by

3123
01:53:55,110 --> 01:53:59,820
definition and then that's that's the

3124
01:53:58,320 --> 01:54:01,409
effect of that is multiplied by the fact

3125
01:53:59,820 --> 01:54:03,840
that women who are a Pergamus appeal

3126
01:54:01,409 --> 01:54:05,159
from the top and so that the males who

3127
01:54:03,840 --> 01:54:07,590
are the most competent are much more

3128
01:54:05,159 --> 01:54:09,360
likely to leave offspring and that

3129
01:54:07,590 --> 01:54:10,829
seemed to be what drove our cortical

3130
01:54:09,360 --> 01:54:12,239
expansion for example which happened

3131
01:54:10,829 --> 01:54:17,369
very very rapidly over the course of

3132
01:54:12,239 --> 01:54:19,019
evolutionary time so and when the woman

3133
01:54:17,369 --> 01:54:20,519
saw that the tree was good for food and

3134
01:54:19,019 --> 01:54:24,530
that it was pleasant to the eyes and a

3135
01:54:20,519 --> 01:54:26,760
tree to be desired to make one wise she

3136
01:54:24,530 --> 01:54:28,590
took of the fruit thereof and did eat

3137
01:54:26,760 --> 01:54:29,429
and gave also unto her husband with her

3138
01:54:28,590 --> 01:54:32,550
and he did eat

3139
01:54:29,429 --> 01:54:33,840
oh yes and women share food that's a

3140
01:54:32,550 --> 01:54:35,519
very strange thing because most

3141
01:54:33,840 --> 01:54:37,409
creatures don't do that right most

3142
01:54:35,519 --> 01:54:38,400
animals don't share food like if you if

3143
01:54:37,409 --> 01:54:40,199
you're a wolf and you bring down

3144
01:54:38,400 --> 01:54:42,780
something in a hunt you eat your fill

3145
01:54:40,199 --> 01:54:44,039
the dominant creatures eat their fill

3146
01:54:42,780 --> 01:54:45,239
and then if there's some left over the

3147
01:54:44,039 --> 01:54:47,369
subordinates get to eat too but that

3148
01:54:45,239 --> 01:54:49,139
doesn't how human beings work we share

3149
01:54:47,369 --> 01:54:51,929
food now you can imagine how that

3150
01:54:49,139 --> 01:54:54,300
evolved because lots of female creatures

3151
01:54:51,929 --> 01:54:55,860
share food with their offspring ok you

3152
01:54:54,300 --> 01:54:57,539
don't need much of a twist in that from

3153
01:54:55,860 --> 01:54:59,280
an evolutionary perspective till you

3154
01:54:57,539 --> 01:55:01,349
start to share food not only with your

3155
01:54:59,280 --> 01:55:02,880
offspring se but with your mate and

3156
01:55:01,349 --> 01:55:05,010
that's another way that you entice a

3157
01:55:02,880 --> 01:55:06,840
mate it's like we're gonna be better

3158
01:55:05,010 --> 01:55:08,550
together then alone well that's the

3159
01:55:06,840 --> 01:55:10,979
offering of the fruit well what's the

3160
01:55:08,550 --> 01:55:13,139
self-conscious part well here's part of

3161
01:55:10,979 --> 01:55:15,030
the bargain you know I'm gonna wake you

3162
01:55:13,139 --> 01:55:16,289
up and partly I'm gonna wake you up

3163
01:55:15,030 --> 01:55:18,239
because you need to be woken up because

3164
01:55:16,289 --> 01:55:20,039
I have this infant that needs some damn

3165
01:55:18,239 --> 01:55:21,809
care and so you bloody well better be

3166
01:55:20,039 --> 01:55:24,179
awake and part of the bargain is all

3167
01:55:21,809 --> 01:55:26,219
offer you something I'll offer you some

3168
01:55:24,179 --> 01:55:29,010
food and in response we're gonna make a

3169
01:55:26,219 --> 01:55:31,440
team and that's the deal well that's the

3170
01:55:29,010 --> 01:55:33,809
human deal and that's why we're more or

3171
01:55:31,440 --> 01:55:35,880
less monogamous by why we more or less

3172
01:55:33,809 --> 01:55:37,409
pair bond and why something

3173
01:55:35,880 --> 01:55:39,900
approximating marriage is a human

3174
01:55:37,409 --> 01:55:41,519
Universal it's cross-cultural now you

3175
01:55:39,900 --> 01:55:41,909
can find exceptions but who the hell

3176
01:55:41,519 --> 01:55:45,190
cares

3177
01:55:41,909 --> 01:55:48,280
the vast really man who cares

3178
01:55:45,190 --> 01:55:49,990
the VIP you look at the vast pattern the

3179
01:55:48,280 --> 01:55:51,430
vast pattern well in the price we pay

3180
01:55:49,990 --> 01:55:52,900
for having large brains is that we're

3181
01:55:51,430 --> 01:55:54,610
very dependent and it takes a long time

3182
01:55:52,900 --> 01:55:56,980
for us to get programmed and because of

3183
01:55:54,610 --> 01:55:58,930
that we need relatively stable family

3184
01:55:56,980 --> 01:56:01,060
bonding and that's basically what we've

3185
01:55:58,930 --> 01:56:02,590
evolved and you know you don't get that

3186
01:56:01,060 --> 01:56:04,030
without making men self-conscious

3187
01:56:02,590 --> 01:56:06,760
because male creatures

3188
01:56:04,030 --> 01:56:08,350
why not impregnate and run I mean why

3189
01:56:06,760 --> 01:56:10,150
the hell not and that's something to

3190
01:56:08,350 --> 01:56:12,400
really no kidding like that's the thing

3191
01:56:10,150 --> 01:56:13,750
to think about it is not why man

3192
01:56:12,400 --> 01:56:14,200
abandoned their children that's the

3193
01:56:13,750 --> 01:56:17,440
mystery

3194
01:56:14,200 --> 01:56:19,840
it's why any men ever stick with them

3195
01:56:17,440 --> 01:56:22,330
that's the mystery because you just have

3196
01:56:19,840 --> 01:56:24,670
to look at the animal kingdom and like

3197
01:56:22,330 --> 01:56:27,910
the simplest and easiest thing is always

3198
01:56:24,670 --> 01:56:29,890
the most likely thing to occur so it's

3199
01:56:27,910 --> 01:56:32,920
the exception that long-term commitment

3200
01:56:29,890 --> 01:56:34,390
that needs explanation she took of the

3201
01:56:32,920 --> 01:56:36,010
fruit thereof and did eat and gave also

3202
01:56:34,390 --> 01:56:38,590
unto her husband with her and he did eat

3203
01:56:36,010 --> 01:56:40,540
and the eyes of both of them were opened

3204
01:56:38,590 --> 01:56:42,910
implying that before that they were

3205
01:56:40,540 --> 01:56:44,770
closed and they knew they were naked and

3206
01:56:42,910 --> 01:56:46,420
they sewed fig leaves together and made

3207
01:56:44,770 --> 01:56:48,430
themselves aprons so that's so

3208
01:56:46,420 --> 01:56:49,720
interesting so their eyes are open which

3209
01:56:48,430 --> 01:56:51,250
indicates that they weren't to begin

3210
01:56:49,720 --> 01:56:53,320
with so whatever God created to begin

3211
01:56:51,250 --> 01:56:55,360
with was kind of blind indeed but not

3212
01:56:53,320 --> 01:56:56,680
blind in some strange way cuz they

3213
01:56:55,360 --> 01:56:58,630
weren't obviously wandering around in

3214
01:56:56,680 --> 01:57:00,550
the garden bumping into trees it was

3215
01:56:58,630 --> 01:57:02,800
some sort of metaphysical blindness

3216
01:57:00,550 --> 01:57:04,600
that's been removed by whatever has just

3217
01:57:02,800 --> 01:57:05,860
happened and whatever's just happened

3218
01:57:04,600 --> 01:57:07,810
also made them realize that they were

3219
01:57:05,860 --> 01:57:09,880
naked okay so what sort of eye opening

3220
01:57:07,810 --> 01:57:12,790
is that well what does it mean to

3221
01:57:09,880 --> 01:57:14,950
realize that you're naked it means to

3222
01:57:12,790 --> 01:57:17,950
realize that you're vulnerable that's

3223
01:57:14,950 --> 01:57:21,220
what people discovered it's like oh we

3224
01:57:17,950 --> 01:57:22,810
can be hurt so you're a zebra in a herd

3225
01:57:21,220 --> 01:57:24,700
of zebras and there's a bunch of lions

3226
01:57:22,810 --> 01:57:28,000
around there laying on the grass you

3227
01:57:24,700 --> 01:57:30,340
don't care those are laying down lions

3228
01:57:28,000 --> 01:57:32,140
laying down lions are no problem

3229
01:57:30,340 --> 01:57:33,520
it's standing up hunting Lions that are

3230
01:57:32,140 --> 01:57:35,350
the problem you're not smart enough to

3231
01:57:33,520 --> 01:57:37,660
figure out that laying down lines turn

3232
01:57:35,350 --> 01:57:39,970
into standing up hunting lions so you're

3233
01:57:37,660 --> 01:57:42,100
not like building a fort to keep the

3234
01:57:39,970 --> 01:57:42,880
Lions out you're just mindlessly eating

3235
01:57:42,100 --> 01:57:44,920
grass

3236
01:57:42,880 --> 01:57:46,420
you're not very awake but that's not

3237
01:57:44,920 --> 01:57:48,090
what happens to human beings is they

3238
01:57:46,420 --> 01:57:51,210
wake up and they think we're vulnerable

3239
01:57:48,090 --> 01:57:54,310
permanently it's never going away right

3240
01:57:51,210 --> 01:57:57,100
it's the it's the recognition of that

3241
01:57:54,310 --> 01:57:58,210
eternal vulnerability and what happens

3242
01:57:57,100 --> 01:57:59,019
the first thing they do is clothe

3243
01:57:58,210 --> 01:58:01,269
themselves

3244
01:57:59,019 --> 01:58:02,739
well what happens when you're naked when

3245
01:58:01,269 --> 01:58:04,329
you need protection from the world well

3246
01:58:02,739 --> 01:58:06,519
obviously look you're all wearing

3247
01:58:04,329 --> 01:58:09,159
clothes you know why

3248
01:58:06,519 --> 01:58:10,929
well we've been doing that for a very

3249
01:58:09,159 --> 01:58:13,210
very long period of time it's tens of

3250
01:58:10,929 --> 01:58:15,550
thousands of years at minimum in fact

3251
01:58:13,210 --> 01:58:17,559
you can track more or less when clothing

3252
01:58:15,550 --> 01:58:18,880
developed because you can do DNA testing

3253
01:58:17,559 --> 01:58:20,619
of the kind of lice that cling to

3254
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:22,539
clothes rather than hair and so we have

3255
01:58:20,619 --> 01:58:24,849
a pretty good idea of when clothing

3256
01:58:22,539 --> 01:58:26,710
emerged and of different types as well

3257
01:58:24,849 --> 01:58:28,659
so that's quite cool but the point is

3258
01:58:26,710 --> 01:58:30,849
they're naked and they think that's not

3259
01:58:28,659 --> 01:58:32,139
so good we're vulnerable so their eyes

3260
01:58:30,849 --> 01:58:34,150
were open enough so they become

3261
01:58:32,139 --> 01:58:35,349
self-conscious and they recognize their

3262
01:58:34,150 --> 01:58:37,420
own vulnerability and the first thing

3263
01:58:35,349 --> 01:58:38,769
they do is the first step of culture is

3264
01:58:37,420 --> 01:58:41,170
to protect themselves with something

3265
01:58:38,769 --> 01:58:42,519
from the world and you protect yourself

3266
01:58:41,170 --> 01:58:45,880
from the world and from the prying eyes

3267
01:58:42,519 --> 01:58:48,460
of other people this is the book by Lynn

3268
01:58:45,880 --> 01:58:50,260
Isabel why we see so well from the

3269
01:58:48,460 --> 01:58:52,030
temptation of Eve to the venomous murder

3270
01:58:50,260 --> 01:58:53,559
of the Mighty Thor the serpent appears

3271
01:58:52,030 --> 01:58:55,749
throughout time and culture as a figure

3272
01:58:53,559 --> 01:58:57,280
of mischief and mystery misery the

3273
01:58:55,749 --> 01:58:59,230
worldwide prominence of snakes in

3274
01:58:57,280 --> 01:59:01,030
religion myth and for Clure underscores

3275
01:58:59,230 --> 01:59:03,070
our deep connection to the serpent but

3276
01:59:01,030 --> 01:59:06,039
why when so few of us have first-hand

3277
01:59:03,070 --> 01:59:07,749
experience mm-hmm the surprising answer

3278
01:59:06,039 --> 01:59:10,619
this book suggests lies in the singular

3279
01:59:07,749 --> 01:59:12,760
effect of snakes on primate evolution

3280
01:59:10,619 --> 01:59:14,170
predation pressure from snakes Lynn

3281
01:59:12,760 --> 01:59:16,269
Isabel tells us is ultimately

3282
01:59:14,170 --> 01:59:18,969
responsible for the superior vision and

3283
01:59:16,269 --> 01:59:20,949
large brains of primates and for a

3284
01:59:18,969 --> 01:59:23,320
critical aspect of human evolution that

3285
01:59:20,949 --> 01:59:24,820
was tested recently psychologists have

3286
01:59:23,320 --> 01:59:26,860
known for a long time that people are

3287
01:59:24,820 --> 01:59:28,869
can learn fear to snakes but they

3288
01:59:26,860 --> 01:59:31,239
discovered in primates recently a set of

3289
01:59:28,869 --> 01:59:34,389
neurons Paulding or neural neurons which

3290
01:59:31,239 --> 01:59:36,340
are specialized that's an old old

3291
01:59:34,389 --> 01:59:37,960
perceptual systems reveal

3292
01:59:36,340 --> 01:59:40,719
neurobiological evidence of past

3293
01:59:37,960 --> 01:59:43,360
selection for rapid detections of snakes

3294
01:59:40,719 --> 01:59:48,280
so that's from 2013 so the snake

3295
01:59:43,360 --> 01:59:50,230
definitely woke us up color vision as an

3296
01:59:48,280 --> 01:59:52,749
adaptation to fruit eating in primates

3297
01:59:50,230 --> 01:59:54,579
it's not by accident that women make

3298
01:59:52,749 --> 01:59:57,969
themselves look like ripe fruit in order

3299
01:59:54,579 --> 02:00:00,369
to be attractive to men right and that's

3300
01:59:57,969 --> 02:00:04,360
also not socio-cultural in origin

3301
02:00:00,369 --> 02:00:05,920
so and they heard the voice of the Lord

3302
02:00:04,360 --> 02:00:07,840
God walking in the garden in the cool of

3303
02:00:05,920 --> 02:00:09,369
the day and Adam and his wife hid

3304
02:00:07,840 --> 02:00:10,539
themselves from the presence of the Lord

3305
02:00:09,369 --> 02:00:12,439
God amongst the trees of the garden

3306
02:00:10,539 --> 02:00:16,010
that's interesting

3307
02:00:12,439 --> 02:00:18,800
so what's the implication prior to being

3308
02:00:16,010 --> 02:00:21,380
woken up prior to recognizing nakedness

3309
02:00:18,800 --> 02:00:23,150
and vulnerability there was no reason

3310
02:00:21,380 --> 02:00:25,550
for God for men and women to hide from

3311
02:00:23,150 --> 02:00:27,829
God now are they hiding from God well

3312
02:00:25,550 --> 02:00:29,630
they're naked they're vulnerable

3313
02:00:27,829 --> 02:00:33,199
okay so think about this think about

3314
02:00:29,630 --> 02:00:35,269
this it's like imagine that you have the

3315
02:00:33,199 --> 02:00:37,459
capacity to live truthfully and

3316
02:00:35,269 --> 02:00:39,289
courageously and forthrightly just

3317
02:00:37,459 --> 02:00:42,320
imagine that and then imagine why you

3318
02:00:39,289 --> 02:00:44,179
might not do that and then imagine well

3319
02:00:42,320 --> 02:00:45,219
how about fear and shame how would that

3320
02:00:44,179 --> 02:00:47,989
work

3321
02:00:45,219 --> 02:00:50,179
well let's say that the idea of living

3322
02:00:47,989 --> 02:00:52,429
forthrightly and truthfully and

3323
02:00:50,179 --> 02:00:53,869
courageously is analogous given what we

3324
02:00:52,429 --> 02:00:55,909
already know about these stories to

3325
02:00:53,869 --> 02:00:57,409
walking with God in the garden well what

3326
02:00:55,909 --> 02:00:59,780
stops people from doing that what stops

3327
02:00:57,409 --> 02:01:01,099
people from hiding well it's their own

3328
02:00:59,780 --> 02:01:02,599
rage the recognition of their own

3329
02:01:01,099 --> 02:01:04,699
inadequacy they look at themselves and

3330
02:01:02,599 --> 02:01:07,639
they think how in the world is a

3331
02:01:04,699 --> 02:01:10,309
creature such as I supposed to live

3332
02:01:07,639 --> 02:01:11,780
properly in this world with everything

3333
02:01:10,309 --> 02:01:13,969
that's wrong with me

3334
02:01:11,780 --> 02:01:15,889
and so what are you hide from well you

3335
02:01:13,969 --> 02:01:17,479
you go home you sit on your bed for five

3336
02:01:15,889 --> 02:01:19,880
minutes and ask yourself what have you

3337
02:01:17,479 --> 02:01:22,189
hidden from in your life man you'll have

3338
02:01:19,880 --> 02:01:24,289
books of knowledge reveal themselves to

3339
02:01:22,189 --> 02:01:26,269
you in your imagination right say well

3340
02:01:24,289 --> 02:01:28,579
why are you hiding well it's no bloody

3341
02:01:26,269 --> 02:01:30,320
wonder you're hiding it's no wonder that

3342
02:01:28,579 --> 02:01:32,599
people hide that's the thing that's so

3343
02:01:30,320 --> 02:01:34,369
terrifying about this story we woke up

3344
02:01:32,599 --> 02:01:36,469
and we thought oh my god look at this

3345
02:01:34,369 --> 02:01:37,880
place like this is seriously there's

3346
02:01:36,469 --> 02:01:39,380
some serious trouble here and we're in

3347
02:01:37,880 --> 02:01:42,409
some serious trouble and we're not what

3348
02:01:39,380 --> 02:01:44,209
we could be and so we hide and that's

3349
02:01:42,409 --> 02:01:46,189
what the story says people woke up they

3350
02:01:44,209 --> 02:01:47,840
became self-conscious they recognized

3351
02:01:46,189 --> 02:01:49,999
their own vulnerability and that made

3352
02:01:47,840 --> 02:01:52,579
them made them hide from manifesting

3353
02:01:49,999 --> 02:01:54,530
their divine destiny it's like yeah

3354
02:01:52,579 --> 02:01:55,999
that's exactly right and the Lord go

3355
02:01:54,530 --> 02:01:58,400
there I love this part of the story and

3356
02:01:55,999 --> 02:01:59,959
that's so funny and the Lord God called

3357
02:01:58,400 --> 02:02:02,869
and we could use a little humor at this

3358
02:01:59,959 --> 02:02:04,929
point and the Lord God called unto Adam

3359
02:02:02,869 --> 02:02:08,630
and said unto Him where art thou and

3360
02:02:04,929 --> 02:02:12,110
Adam said I heard thy voice in the

3361
02:02:08,630 --> 02:02:14,090
garden and I was afraid because I was

3362
02:02:12,110 --> 02:02:18,309
naked so in case there was any doubt

3363
02:02:14,090 --> 02:02:18,309
about that that's why and I hid myself

3364
02:02:23,120 --> 02:02:27,620
and God said who told you that you were

3365
02:02:26,790 --> 02:02:30,270
naked

3366
02:02:27,620 --> 02:02:32,070
did you eat of the tree where have I

3367
02:02:30,270 --> 02:02:35,160
commanded you that you should not eat

3368
02:02:32,070 --> 02:02:41,370
and this is where Adam shows himself in

3369
02:02:35,160 --> 02:02:52,380
all his post-fall heroic glory and the

3370
02:02:41,370 --> 02:02:56,130
man said the woman whom thou gave us to

3371
02:02:52,380 --> 02:02:58,530
be with me she gave me of the tree and I

3372
02:02:56,130 --> 02:03:02,310
did eat so that's that pert man that's

3373
02:02:58,530 --> 02:03:05,130
such that it's so you know again there's

3374
02:03:02,310 --> 02:03:07,050
a modern feminist interpretation of the

3375
02:03:05,130 --> 02:03:09,210
story of Adam and Eve that makes the

3376
02:03:07,050 --> 02:03:12,090
claim that Eve was portrayed as the

3377
02:03:09,210 --> 02:03:14,640
universal bad guy of humanity for

3378
02:03:12,090 --> 02:03:17,580
disobeying God and eating the Apple

3379
02:03:14,640 --> 02:03:20,190
it's like fair enough you know looks

3380
02:03:17,580 --> 02:03:22,740
like she slipped up and then she tempted

3381
02:03:20,190 --> 02:03:25,440
her husband and you know that makes her

3382
02:03:22,740 --> 02:03:27,480
even worse although he's was foolish

3383
02:03:25,440 --> 02:03:28,710
enough to immediately eat so it just

3384
02:03:27,480 --> 02:03:30,270
means she was a little more courageous

3385
02:03:28,710 --> 02:03:32,610
than him then got there first

3386
02:03:30,270 --> 02:03:34,620
but it's Adam who comes across as really

3387
02:03:32,610 --> 02:03:36,360
one sad creature in this story as far as

3388
02:03:34,620 --> 02:03:39,090
I'm concerned welcome buddy manages in

3389
02:03:36,360 --> 02:03:41,220
one sentence it's like first of all it

3390
02:03:39,090 --> 02:03:44,250
wasn't him it was the woman and second

3391
02:03:41,220 --> 02:03:46,170
even blames God so it wasn't just the

3392
02:03:44,250 --> 02:03:50,880
woman it was it was that woman and you

3393
02:03:46,170 --> 02:03:52,500
gave her to me and she gave me of the

3394
02:03:50,880 --> 02:03:54,720
tree and I did eat it's like so hey

3395
02:03:52,500 --> 02:03:59,330
Adams all innocent except now he's not

3396
02:03:54,720 --> 02:04:02,310
only is he naked and disobedient and

3397
02:03:59,330 --> 02:04:07,410
cowardly and ashamed

3398
02:04:02,310 --> 02:04:09,420
he's also snively backbiting think he

3399
02:04:07,410 --> 02:04:11,370
rats her out like the sick and he gets

3400
02:04:09,420 --> 02:04:13,170
the opportunity and then he blames God

3401
02:04:11,370 --> 02:04:15,390
it's like and that's exactly right

3402
02:04:13,170 --> 02:04:18,000
that's exactly right man you go online

3403
02:04:15,390 --> 02:04:19,440
and you read you read the commentary

3404
02:04:18,000 --> 02:04:21,630
that men write about women when they're

3405
02:04:19,440 --> 02:04:23,040
resentful and bitter about women you

3406
02:04:21,630 --> 02:04:26,400
read it it's so interesting it's like

3407
02:04:23,040 --> 02:04:28,740
it's not me it's those [ __ ] okay

3408
02:04:26,400 --> 02:04:31,440
that's right it's not me it's them and

3409
02:04:28,740 --> 02:04:33,930
not only that what a bloody world this

3410
02:04:31,440 --> 02:04:36,000
is in which they exist it's exactly the

3411
02:04:33,930 --> 02:04:36,659
same thing it's exactly the same thing

3412
02:04:36,000 --> 02:04:48,840
and it is

3413
02:04:36,659 --> 02:04:50,639
absolutely pathetic all right and the

3414
02:04:48,840 --> 02:04:52,170
Lord God said unto the woman what is

3415
02:04:50,639 --> 02:04:53,790
this that thou has done and the woman

3416
02:04:52,170 --> 02:04:56,190
said the serpent beguiled me and I did

3417
02:04:53,790 --> 02:04:58,350
eat well he she has a bloody excuse

3418
02:04:56,190 --> 02:04:59,790
first of all it's a snake I mean those

3419
02:04:58,350 --> 02:05:01,860
things there was we already found out

3420
02:04:59,790 --> 02:05:04,560
there's subtle and second it turns out

3421
02:05:01,860 --> 02:05:06,210
that the damn snake is Satan himself you

3422
02:05:04,560 --> 02:05:09,719
know and he's rather treacherous so the

3423
02:05:06,210 --> 02:05:13,650
fact that she got tangled up in his mess

3424
02:05:09,719 --> 02:05:15,570
let's say is well problematic but it

3425
02:05:13,650 --> 02:05:18,900
it's a hell of a lot better excuse that

3426
02:05:15,570 --> 02:05:20,610
Adam has and the Lord God says unto the

3427
02:05:18,900 --> 02:05:22,230
serpent because thou has done that done

3428
02:05:20,610 --> 02:05:24,090
this thou art cursed above all cattle

3429
02:05:22,230 --> 02:05:29,130
and above every beast of the field upon

3430
02:05:24,090 --> 02:05:30,480
thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt

3431
02:05:29,130 --> 02:05:33,690
thou eat all the days of my life

3432
02:05:30,480 --> 02:05:36,630
and snakes by the way are lizards that

3433
02:05:33,690 --> 02:05:38,130
lost their legs just so you know and I

3434
02:05:36,630 --> 02:05:40,860
will put enmity between thee and the

3435
02:05:38,130 --> 02:05:43,260
woman and between thy seed and her seed

3436
02:05:40,860 --> 02:05:46,530
it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt

3437
02:05:43,260 --> 02:05:50,310
bruise his heel I love these pictures

3438
02:05:46,530 --> 02:05:51,960
they're so smart and again strip the

3439
02:05:50,310 --> 02:05:53,969
religious context from them and just

3440
02:05:51,960 --> 02:05:57,989
look at them for a second what do you

3441
02:05:53,969 --> 02:06:02,280
see you see the eternal mother holding

3442
02:05:57,989 --> 02:06:08,540
her infant away from the snake see it

3443
02:06:02,280 --> 02:06:10,620
down there right crocodile snake

3444
02:06:08,540 --> 02:06:13,260
everything predatory that's been after

3445
02:06:10,620 --> 02:06:15,870
us for like 60 million years the reason

3446
02:06:13,260 --> 02:06:19,110
we're here is because of that that's why

3447
02:06:15,870 --> 02:06:22,230
it's a sacred image now this one I like

3448
02:06:19,110 --> 02:06:23,489
even better see down there there's

3449
02:06:22,230 --> 02:06:25,560
something like the moon and then there's

3450
02:06:23,489 --> 02:06:27,389
this reptile down there that Eve is

3451
02:06:25,560 --> 02:06:28,830
standing on this is really old and I

3452
02:06:27,389 --> 02:06:30,570
showed you this before but I think it's

3453
02:06:28,830 --> 02:06:32,250
so cool she's coming out of this thing

3454
02:06:30,570 --> 02:06:34,830
that's like a hole in the sky you know

3455
02:06:32,250 --> 02:06:36,840
because it indicates the eternal re

3456
02:06:34,830 --> 02:06:38,850
presence of this figure it's something

3457
02:06:36,840 --> 02:06:41,219
like that the eternal recurrence of this

3458
02:06:38,850 --> 02:06:43,739
figure it's an archetype but then the

3459
02:06:41,219 --> 02:06:44,969
the the potential out of which she is

3460
02:06:43,739 --> 02:06:47,040
emerging these are all musical

3461
02:06:44,969 --> 02:06:48,989
instruments back here and so what the

3462
02:06:47,040 --> 02:06:49,960
artist is representing is the great

3463
02:06:48,989 --> 02:06:53,320
powder

3464
02:06:49,960 --> 02:06:55,450
complexity of being and the emergence of

3465
02:06:53,320 --> 02:06:57,489
the protective mother from that

3466
02:06:55,450 --> 02:07:00,310
background protecting the infant

3467
02:06:57,489 --> 02:07:02,680
eternally against predation it's like

3468
02:07:00,310 --> 02:07:04,180
how can that not be a holy image if it

3469
02:07:02,680 --> 02:07:05,530
isn't a holy image if you don't think

3470
02:07:04,180 --> 02:07:07,750
it's a holy image then there isn't

3471
02:07:05,530 --> 02:07:11,980
something wrong with the image there's

3472
02:07:07,750 --> 02:07:13,780
something wrong with the perceiver unto

3473
02:07:11,980 --> 02:07:15,520
the woman he said well God's just

3474
02:07:13,780 --> 02:07:17,410
outlining the consequences of this right

3475
02:07:15,520 --> 02:07:19,060
now it's like okay well now you've gone

3476
02:07:17,410 --> 02:07:21,430
and done it you've woken up this is

3477
02:07:19,060 --> 02:07:23,130
what's going to happen I'll greatly

3478
02:07:21,430 --> 02:07:25,210
multiply thy sorrow and thy conception

3479
02:07:23,130 --> 02:07:27,969
in sorrow thou shalt bring forth

3480
02:07:25,210 --> 02:07:30,390
children and thy desire shall be to thy

3481
02:07:27,969 --> 02:07:35,860
husband and he shall rule over thee

3482
02:07:30,390 --> 02:07:37,450
doesn't say he should says he will and

3483
02:07:35,860 --> 02:07:40,930
why in sorrow shalt thou bring forth

3484
02:07:37,450 --> 02:07:45,190
children well when you develop a brain

3485
02:07:40,930 --> 02:07:48,130
that big so that you can see it's not

3486
02:07:45,190 --> 02:07:49,780
that easy to give birth anymore and then

3487
02:07:48,130 --> 02:07:51,940
you produce something that's dependent

3488
02:07:49,780 --> 02:07:54,370
beyond belief and that's one of the

3489
02:07:51,940 --> 02:07:57,090
things that you would say dooms you to

3490
02:07:54,370 --> 02:08:00,989
precisely this so that's Eve's

3491
02:07:57,090 --> 02:08:03,010
punishment for waking up and Adam

3492
02:08:00,989 --> 02:08:04,540
because thou has hearkened unto the

3493
02:08:03,010 --> 02:08:05,770
voice of thy wife and has eaten of the

3494
02:08:04,540 --> 02:08:08,020
tree of which I commanded thee saying

3495
02:08:05,770 --> 02:08:10,960
thou shalt not eat it cursed is the

3496
02:08:08,020 --> 02:08:12,670
ground for thy sake in sorrow shalt thou

3497
02:08:10,960 --> 02:08:13,960
eat of it in all the days of thy life

3498
02:08:12,670 --> 02:08:17,440
what's that

3499
02:08:13,960 --> 02:08:19,150
it's the invention of work thorns and

3500
02:08:17,440 --> 02:08:20,739
thistles shall it bring forth to thee

3501
02:08:19,150 --> 02:08:22,870
and thou shalt eat the herb of the field

3502
02:08:20,739 --> 02:08:25,810
it's the invention of work what do

3503
02:08:22,870 --> 02:08:28,210
people do that animals don't work what

3504
02:08:25,810 --> 02:08:30,340
does work mean means you sacrifice the

3505
02:08:28,210 --> 02:08:32,050
present for the future and why do you do

3506
02:08:30,340 --> 02:08:35,050
that because you know you're vulnerable

3507
02:08:32,050 --> 02:08:36,910
because you're awake and so from here on

3508
02:08:35,050 --> 02:08:38,650
in from this point there's no return to

3509
02:08:36,910 --> 02:08:40,330
unconscious paradise I don't care how

3510
02:08:38,650 --> 02:08:42,100
many problems you've solved so that

3511
02:08:40,330 --> 02:08:43,660
today is okay you've got a lot of

3512
02:08:42,100 --> 02:08:45,370
problems coming up and they'll bloody

3513
02:08:43,660 --> 02:08:46,719
matter how much you work you're never

3514
02:08:45,370 --> 02:08:48,790
going to work enough to solve them and

3515
02:08:46,719 --> 02:08:50,800
so all you're gonna do from here on in

3516
02:08:48,790 --> 02:08:52,750
is be terrified of the future and that's

3517
02:08:50,800 --> 02:08:54,580
the price of waking up and that's the

3518
02:08:52,750 --> 02:08:56,320
end of paradise and that's the beginning

3519
02:08:54,580 --> 02:09:00,700
of history and that's how that story

3520
02:08:56,320 --> 02:09:02,770
goes in this sweat of thy face shalt

3521
02:09:00,700 --> 02:09:03,789
thou eat bread till thou return unto the

3522
02:09:02,770 --> 02:09:05,980
ground for out of it

3523
02:09:03,789 --> 02:09:09,909
though taken for dust thou art and unto

3524
02:09:05,980 --> 02:09:11,710
dust thou shalt return and Adam called

3525
02:09:09,909 --> 02:09:14,730
his wife's name Eve because she was the

3526
02:09:11,710 --> 02:09:14,730
mother of all living

3527
02:09:15,300 --> 02:09:20,260
unto Adam also and unto his wife did the

3528
02:09:18,219 --> 02:09:22,719
Lord God make coats of skin and clothed

3529
02:09:20,260 --> 02:09:25,510
them that's William Blake by the way and

3530
02:09:22,719 --> 02:09:26,980
the Lord God said Behold the man has

3531
02:09:25,510 --> 02:09:28,659
become as one of us to know good and

3532
02:09:26,980 --> 02:09:30,190
evil and now lest he put forth his hand

3533
02:09:28,659 --> 02:09:34,329
and take also of the tree of life and

3534
02:09:30,190 --> 02:09:35,260
eat and live forever I'll go over this

3535
02:09:34,329 --> 02:09:37,269
again next week

3536
02:09:35,260 --> 02:09:38,920
therefore the galore God sent him from

3537
02:09:37,269 --> 02:09:40,210
the forth forth from the Garden of Eden

3538
02:09:38,920 --> 02:09:42,070
to till the ground from whence he was

3539
02:09:40,210 --> 02:09:43,539
taken so he drove out the man and he

3540
02:09:42,070 --> 02:09:45,909
placed at the east of the Garden of Eden

3541
02:09:43,539 --> 02:09:47,619
cherubims and a flaming sword which

3542
02:09:45,909 --> 02:09:50,070
turned every way to keep the way of the

3543
02:09:47,619 --> 02:09:50,070
Tree of Life

3544
02:10:01,120 --> 02:10:11,430
one more thing and then we'll stop so I

3545
02:10:05,860 --> 02:10:13,720
thought why in the world so Adam and Eve

3546
02:10:11,430 --> 02:10:15,130
are tempted by the snake they eat the

3547
02:10:13,720 --> 02:10:17,890
fruit they wake up they realize they're

3548
02:10:15,130 --> 02:10:19,450
naked they realize that they're

3549
02:10:17,890 --> 02:10:20,830
vulnerable they realize the future they

3550
02:10:19,450 --> 02:10:23,470
realize they're gonna die they realized

3551
02:10:20,830 --> 02:10:25,900
that they have to work it accounts for

3552
02:10:23,470 --> 02:10:27,970
difficulty and conception and the fall

3553
02:10:25,900 --> 02:10:31,750
of humankind from unconscious paradise

3554
02:10:27,970 --> 02:10:34,090
okay that makes sense what about the

3555
02:10:31,750 --> 02:10:37,540
knowledge of good and evil what in the

3556
02:10:34,090 --> 02:10:39,640
world does that mean the Mesopotamians

3557
02:10:37,540 --> 02:10:41,560
believed that human beings were made out

3558
02:10:39,640 --> 02:10:43,450
of the blood of King knew who was the

3559
02:10:41,560 --> 02:10:46,330
worst monster that time out who was the

3560
02:10:43,450 --> 02:10:48,430
goddess of chaos could imagine and then

3561
02:10:46,330 --> 02:10:51,010
produce so their idea was that whatever

3562
02:10:48,430 --> 02:10:56,340
was about humanity there was something

3563
02:10:51,010 --> 02:10:56,340
deeply deeply deeply demonically flawed

3564
02:10:57,180 --> 02:11:02,380
so that's their conception and the some

3565
02:11:00,850 --> 02:11:05,050
of that same milieu that these stories

3566
02:11:02,380 --> 02:11:07,810
emerge so what is opening your eyes and

3567
02:11:05,050 --> 02:11:08,790
realizing your vulnerability have to do

3568
02:11:07,810 --> 02:11:10,660
with the knowledge of good and evil

3569
02:11:08,790 --> 02:11:12,100
really I thought about that I really

3570
02:11:10,660 --> 02:11:13,180
thought about that I got to tell you I

3571
02:11:12,100 --> 02:11:14,620
thought about that for like 20 years

3572
02:11:13,180 --> 02:11:16,660
because I knew there was something there

3573
02:11:14,620 --> 02:11:19,540
that I could not put together and at the

3574
02:11:16,660 --> 02:11:22,000
same time I was I was reading things I'm

3575
02:11:19,540 --> 02:11:23,770
gonna tell you something truly awful and

3576
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:26,320
so if you need a trigger warning you're

3577
02:11:23,770 --> 02:11:29,020
you're getting one and and believe me I

3578
02:11:26,320 --> 02:11:30,100
do not give trigger warnings lately so

3579
02:11:29,020 --> 02:11:32,950
I'm gonna tell you something you will

3580
02:11:30,100 --> 02:11:34,750
never forget so this is what unit 731

3581
02:11:32,950 --> 02:11:36,460
used to do in China and China said

3582
02:11:34,750 --> 02:11:38,650
Japanese unit during the first Second

3583
02:11:36,460 --> 02:11:40,630
World War right as far as I can tell

3584
02:11:38,650 --> 02:11:42,160
they did the most horrific things that

3585
02:11:40,630 --> 02:11:44,680
were done to anyone during World War two

3586
02:11:42,160 --> 02:11:49,000
and that's really something so this is

3587
02:11:44,680 --> 02:11:54,040
what they did they took their prisoners

3588
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:56,040
and they would put them in a position so

3589
02:11:54,040 --> 02:11:58,440
that their arms would freeze solid and

3590
02:11:56,040 --> 02:12:01,930
then they would take them outside and

3591
02:11:58,440 --> 02:12:03,820
pour hot water over their arms and then

3592
02:12:01,930 --> 02:12:06,730
they would repeat that till the flesh

3593
02:12:03,820 --> 02:12:09,370
came off the bones and they were doing

3594
02:12:06,730 --> 02:12:11,980
that to investigate the treatment of

3595
02:12:09,370 --> 02:12:13,600
frostbite for soldiers now you can look

3596
02:12:11,980 --> 02:12:14,679
up unit 731 if you want to have

3597
02:12:13,600 --> 02:12:18,280
nightmares

3598
02:12:14,679 --> 02:12:20,830
so that's a unit 731 that's human-beings

3599
02:12:18,280 --> 02:12:23,340
someone thought that up and then people

3600
02:12:20,830 --> 02:12:26,350
did it

3601
02:12:23,340 --> 02:12:30,040
that's knowledge of good and evil here's

3602
02:12:26,350 --> 02:12:32,350
the here's the key man you know you're

3603
02:12:30,040 --> 02:12:35,830
vulnerable no other animal knows that

3604
02:12:32,350 --> 02:12:37,750
you know what hurts you because you're

3605
02:12:35,830 --> 02:12:40,780
vulnerable now that you know what hurts

3606
02:12:37,750 --> 02:12:43,600
you you can figure out what hurts

3607
02:12:40,780 --> 02:12:45,550
someone else and as soon as you know

3608
02:12:43,600 --> 02:12:47,500
what hurts someone else and you can use

3609
02:12:45,550 --> 02:12:49,780
that you have the knowledge of good and

3610
02:12:47,500 --> 02:12:51,370
evil well it's a pretty good trick that

3611
02:12:49,780 --> 02:12:52,690
the snake pulled because it doesn't look

3612
02:12:51,370 --> 02:12:54,250
like it's exactly the sort of thing that

3613
02:12:52,690 --> 02:12:56,409
we might have wanted if we would have

3614
02:12:54,250 --> 02:12:58,060
known what the consequence was but as

3615
02:12:56,409 --> 02:13:00,550
soon as a human being is self conscious

3616
02:12:58,060 --> 02:13:02,530
and aware of his own nakedness then he

3617
02:13:00,550 --> 02:13:04,420
has the capacity for evil and that is

3618
02:13:02,530 --> 02:13:06,250
that's introduced into the world right

3619
02:13:04,420 --> 02:13:09,400
at that point and here's the rest of

3620
02:13:06,250 --> 02:13:11,110
this story so there's the snake right

3621
02:13:09,400 --> 02:13:13,270
and you're some tree dwelling primate

3622
02:13:11,110 --> 02:13:15,100
and the snake eats you and that sucks so

3623
02:13:13,270 --> 02:13:16,719
let's like let's watch out for the damn

3624
02:13:15,100 --> 02:13:18,159
snakes and then you think well wait a

3625
02:13:16,719 --> 02:13:19,989
minute your brain grows and you think

3626
02:13:18,159 --> 02:13:22,090
wait a minute well there's not just a

3627
02:13:19,989 --> 02:13:23,590
snake there's where snakes live why

3628
02:13:22,090 --> 02:13:25,000
don't we just get the hell out of the

3629
02:13:23,590 --> 02:13:26,380
tree and go hunt down the snakes and get

3630
02:13:25,000 --> 02:13:28,929
rid of them so those are sort of like

3631
02:13:26,380 --> 02:13:30,520
potential snakes and so the snake

3632
02:13:28,929 --> 02:13:32,170
becomes a potential snake and it's the

3633
02:13:30,520 --> 02:13:33,640
same circuit that you're using to do

3634
02:13:32,170 --> 02:13:34,510
this thinking and then you get rid of

3635
02:13:33,640 --> 02:13:37,600
the damn snakes

3636
02:13:34,510 --> 02:13:38,620
it's like st. Patrick chases the motive

3637
02:13:37,600 --> 02:13:40,780
are no more snakes

3638
02:13:38,620 --> 02:13:42,790
everything's paradise it's like no no no

3639
02:13:40,780 --> 02:13:44,650
that's not that's not how it works no

3640
02:13:42,790 --> 02:13:47,080
well now you've got the human snakes

3641
02:13:44,650 --> 02:13:50,080
you're a tribe you've got tribal enemies

3642
02:13:47,080 --> 02:13:53,590
you got to defend yourself against the

3643
02:13:50,080 --> 02:13:55,060
human snakes right so maybe your empire

3644
02:13:53,590 --> 02:13:57,760
expands and you get rid of all the human

3645
02:13:55,060 --> 02:13:59,800
snakes and then what happens well they

3646
02:13:57,760 --> 02:14:01,870
start to grow develop inside it's like

3647
02:13:59,800 --> 02:14:03,489
you get rid of all the external enemies

3648
02:14:01,870 --> 02:14:05,290
and you make a big city and all of a

3649
02:14:03,489 --> 02:14:07,630
sudden there's enemies that pop up

3650
02:14:05,290 --> 02:14:09,040
inside because the snake isn't just the

3651
02:14:07,630 --> 02:14:10,900
snake in the garden and the snake isn't

3652
02:14:09,040 --> 02:14:12,610
just the possible snake and the snake

3653
02:14:10,900 --> 02:14:16,630
isn't just the snake that's your enemy

3654
02:14:12,610 --> 02:14:18,550
the snake is your friend right because

3655
02:14:16,630 --> 02:14:20,949
your friend can betray you and then it's

3656
02:14:18,550 --> 02:14:21,699
even worse than that because you can

3657
02:14:20,949 --> 02:14:23,380
betray you

3658
02:14:21,699 --> 02:14:25,540
and so even if you get rid of all the

3659
02:14:23,380 --> 02:14:28,540
outside snakes you've got an inside

3660
02:14:25,540 --> 02:14:30,880
snake and god only knows what it's up to

3661
02:14:28,540 --> 02:14:32,770
and that's why the bloody Christians

3662
02:14:30,880 --> 02:14:35,620
associated the snake in the Garden of

3663
02:14:32,770 --> 02:14:37,900
Eden with Satan it's unbelievably

3664
02:14:35,620 --> 02:14:40,600
brilliant because you got to think

3665
02:14:37,900 --> 02:14:41,590
what's the enemy well it's the snake

3666
02:14:40,600 --> 02:14:43,330
fair enough

3667
02:14:41,590 --> 02:14:45,010
but you know that's good if you're a

3668
02:14:43,330 --> 02:14:47,290
tree dwelling primate but if you're a

3669
02:14:45,010 --> 02:14:48,940
sophisticated human being you know with

3670
02:14:47,290 --> 02:14:50,680
six million years of additional

3671
02:14:48,940 --> 02:14:53,020
evolution and you're really trying to

3672
02:14:50,680 --> 02:14:56,200
solve the problem of what it is that's

3673
02:14:53,020 --> 02:14:59,370
the great enemy of mankind well it's the

3674
02:14:56,200 --> 02:15:02,050
human propensity for evil right as such

3675
02:14:59,370 --> 02:15:03,820
well that's the figure of Satan that's

3676
02:15:02,050 --> 02:15:06,030
what that figure means just like there's

3677
02:15:03,820 --> 02:15:09,520
a logos that's the truth that speaks

3678
02:15:06,030 --> 02:15:13,000
order out of chaos at the beginning of

3679
02:15:09,520 --> 02:15:15,130
time there's an antithetical spirit the

3680
02:15:13,000 --> 02:15:16,750
hostile brother that's Cain to Abel

3681
02:15:15,130 --> 02:15:20,250
which we'll talk to talk about next week

3682
02:15:16,750 --> 02:15:23,080
that's doing exactly the opposite that's

3683
02:15:20,250 --> 02:15:24,490
motivated by absolutely nothing but

3684
02:15:23,080 --> 02:15:27,220
malevolence and the willingness to

3685
02:15:24,490 --> 02:15:33,070
destroy and it has every reason for

3686
02:15:27,220 --> 02:15:34,690
doing so and that's what's revealed in

3687
02:15:33,070 --> 02:15:37,840
the next story and Cain and Abel in one

3688
02:15:34,690 --> 02:15:40,810
paragraph the first glimmerings of that

3689
02:15:37,840 --> 02:15:42,850
outside of the strange insistence by the

3690
02:15:40,810 --> 02:15:44,680
Christian mystics let's say on the

3691
02:15:42,850 --> 02:15:47,020
identity between the snake in the Garden

3692
02:15:44,680 --> 02:15:49,530
of Eden and the author of all evil

3693
02:15:47,020 --> 02:15:49,530
himself

3694
02:15:53,130 --> 02:15:56,209
[Applause]

3695
02:15:57,920 --> 02:16:05,280
okay so we only have 15 minutes today I

3696
02:16:00,960 --> 02:16:09,960
I wanted to finish that so apologies for

3697
02:16:05,280 --> 02:16:12,239
going over a little longer all right hi

3698
02:16:09,960 --> 02:16:14,070
dr. Peterson over the last couple weeks

3699
02:16:12,239 --> 02:16:15,989
and further back you talked a lot about

3700
02:16:14,070 --> 02:16:18,120
consciousness and the importance of it

3701
02:16:15,989 --> 02:16:20,460
but I was hoping to get your opinion on

3702
02:16:18,120 --> 02:16:22,440
an issue of consciousness that has often

3703
02:16:20,460 --> 02:16:25,830
seen Christianity among other groups and

3704
02:16:22,440 --> 02:16:28,170
politics kind of clash so I'm hoping to

3705
02:16:25,830 --> 02:16:30,719
get your views on the consciousness or

3706
02:16:28,170 --> 02:16:32,880
lack thereof of a human fetus and how

3707
02:16:30,719 --> 02:16:46,440
that's impacted you views an abortion

3708
02:16:32,880 --> 02:16:58,950
whatever they are and any thank you

3709
02:16:46,440 --> 02:17:00,750
thank you okay so the first question is

3710
02:16:58,950 --> 02:17:06,000
do I have an answer for that that's a

3711
02:17:00,750 --> 02:17:09,870
good enough answer to actually reveal no

3712
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:11,300
I don't but I'll I can flail about a

3713
02:17:09,870 --> 02:17:15,240
little bit around it

3714
02:17:11,300 --> 02:17:17,040
abortion is clearly wrong I don't think

3715
02:17:15,240 --> 02:17:18,840
anybody debates that you wouldn't

3716
02:17:17,040 --> 02:17:25,160
recommend that someone that you love

3717
02:17:18,840 --> 02:17:27,599
have one okay now having clarified that

3718
02:17:25,160 --> 02:17:32,099
that mere statement doesn't eliminate

3719
02:17:27,599 --> 02:17:34,170
the complexity of the situation the

3720
02:17:32,099 --> 02:17:37,670
first question is is should everything

3721
02:17:34,170 --> 02:17:40,130
wrong be illegal that's a tough question

3722
02:17:37,670 --> 02:17:42,599
everything that's wrong isn't illegal

3723
02:17:40,130 --> 02:17:51,260
then there's the additional complication

3724
02:17:42,599 --> 02:17:51,260
of the difference let's say in gravity

3725
02:17:51,650 --> 02:17:55,950
regarding the problem in relationship to

3726
02:17:53,639 --> 02:18:00,599
men and women and we don't know how to

3727
02:17:55,950 --> 02:18:01,769
deal with that having said that I would

3728
02:18:00,599 --> 02:18:05,280
say that it's actually the wrong

3729
02:18:01,769 --> 02:18:06,900
question there's a something Leonard

3730
02:18:05,280 --> 02:18:08,309
Cohen said once he said that in a

3731
02:18:06,900 --> 02:18:09,560
massacre there's no decent place to

3732
02:18:08,309 --> 02:18:12,250
stand

3733
02:18:09,560 --> 02:18:14,690
and what he meant by that was sometimes

3734
02:18:12,250 --> 02:18:20,000
you're where there is no good decision

3735
02:18:14,690 --> 02:18:21,290
left no matter what you do it's wrong so

3736
02:18:20,000 --> 02:18:23,240
then the question is how did you get

3737
02:18:21,290 --> 02:18:25,610
there well let's say you're in a

3738
02:18:23,240 --> 02:18:29,480
position where you are inclined to seek

3739
02:18:25,610 --> 02:18:30,340
an abortion the question is how did you

3740
02:18:29,480 --> 02:18:32,870
get there

3741
02:18:30,340 --> 02:18:36,140
now we have a lot to straighten out

3742
02:18:32,870 --> 02:18:38,960
about sexual relationships between men

3743
02:18:36,140 --> 02:18:40,760
and women in the modern world they're

3744
02:18:38,960 --> 02:18:42,200
bent and warped and demented out of

3745
02:18:40,760 --> 02:18:44,390
shape one of the things I see with young

3746
02:18:42,200 --> 02:18:46,010
people for example is that they will

3747
02:18:44,390 --> 02:18:47,720
engage in sexual acts with one another

3748
02:18:46,010 --> 02:18:48,200
that they would not talk about with one

3749
02:18:47,720 --> 02:18:50,540
another

3750
02:18:48,200 --> 02:18:52,040
I mean couples will do that for that

3751
02:18:50,540 --> 02:18:54,170
matter like married couples will do that

3752
02:18:52,040 --> 02:18:54,770
but they're married that's that's a

3753
02:18:54,170 --> 02:18:57,050
different story

3754
02:18:54,770 --> 02:18:59,000
it seems to me that if you are willing

3755
02:18:57,050 --> 02:19:00,890
to engage in a sexual act with someone

3756
02:18:59,000 --> 02:19:02,540
with whom you would not discuss that act

3757
02:19:00,890 --> 02:19:08,170
you probably put the cart before the

3758
02:19:02,540 --> 02:19:11,300
horse so the discussion regarding the

3759
02:19:08,170 --> 02:19:15,310
legality of abortion is nested inside a

3760
02:19:11,300 --> 02:19:18,230
larger discussion about the morality of

3761
02:19:15,310 --> 02:19:20,750
abortion and that's disconnected inside

3762
02:19:18,230 --> 02:19:22,640
a larger discussion about the proper

3763
02:19:20,750 --> 02:19:26,240
place of sexuality and human behavior

3764
02:19:22,640 --> 02:19:29,150
and to me that's the level at which the

3765
02:19:26,240 --> 02:19:31,400
problem needs to be addressed now I

3766
02:19:29,150 --> 02:19:33,350
don't have the answer to that you know

3767
02:19:31,400 --> 02:19:35,930
because the old answer was get married

3768
02:19:33,350 --> 02:19:37,400
that was a good answer and it's an

3769
02:19:35,930 --> 02:19:40,220
answer that people should still listen

3770
02:19:37,400 --> 02:19:44,690
to but we'll put that aside momentarily

3771
02:19:40,220 --> 02:19:47,540
I had a client at one point who was I

3772
02:19:44,690 --> 02:19:49,280
don't know she was probably I'm not I'm

3773
02:19:47,540 --> 02:19:53,240
gonna disguise her in a variety of

3774
02:19:49,280 --> 02:19:55,370
different ways she was 27 2008 come from

3775
02:19:53,240 --> 02:19:58,960
a relatively conservative background

3776
02:19:55,370 --> 02:20:02,030
quite a timid fearful person and also

3777
02:19:58,960 --> 02:20:04,730
not very well not sophisticated in

3778
02:20:02,030 --> 02:20:06,950
relationship to relationships and she'd

3779
02:20:04,730 --> 02:20:13,221
never had sex well there's a bunch of

3780
02:20:06,950 --> 02:20:17,330
things she'd never done well the answer

3781
02:20:13,221 --> 02:20:19,370
from me to her wasn't continue to be

3782
02:20:17,330 --> 02:20:21,830
timid about everything because that

3783
02:20:19,370 --> 02:20:23,391
wasn't working out for her she needed to

3784
02:20:21,830 --> 02:20:27,471
go have some adventures

3785
02:20:23,391 --> 02:20:30,950
now sexual adventures like other

3786
02:20:27,471 --> 02:20:32,210
adventures are dangerous and so you have

3787
02:20:30,950 --> 02:20:34,130
to be very careful when you encourage

3788
02:20:32,210 --> 02:20:37,940
people to go out and have adventures but

3789
02:20:34,130 --> 02:20:40,610
but but too much timidity and caution

3790
02:20:37,940 --> 02:20:43,940
also constitutes a pathway to perdition

3791
02:20:40,610 --> 02:20:46,851
let's say you can't just say to people

3792
02:20:43,940 --> 02:20:48,950
in the modern world well you know sex

3793
02:20:46,851 --> 02:20:50,391
till you're married unless you're gonna

3794
02:20:48,950 --> 02:20:52,101
get married when you're very young and

3795
02:20:50,391 --> 02:20:52,670
perhaps you should I don't know about

3796
02:20:52,101 --> 02:20:56,480
that

3797
02:20:52,670 --> 02:20:59,210
but I don't think that we're mature

3798
02:20:56,480 --> 02:21:00,530
enough as a culture to have a serious

3799
02:20:59,210 --> 02:21:02,391
discussion about sexual propriety

3800
02:21:00,530 --> 02:21:04,400
especially in the aftermath of the birth

3801
02:21:02,391 --> 02:21:07,030
control pill and we seriously need to do

3802
02:21:04,400 --> 02:21:09,771
that and we have it and so I think the

3803
02:21:07,030 --> 02:21:14,540
eternal debate about abortion horrible

3804
02:21:09,771 --> 02:21:16,750
as it is is a it's the surface

3805
02:21:14,540 --> 02:21:18,920
manifestation of a much deeper problem

3806
02:21:16,750 --> 02:21:20,870
now I talked a little bit today about

3807
02:21:18,920 --> 02:21:23,240
the utility of marriage like the

3808
02:21:20,870 --> 02:21:26,900
spiritual utility of marriage and that's

3809
02:21:23,240 --> 02:21:28,971
something that I think we're so

3810
02:21:26,900 --> 02:21:30,740
immaturely cynical as a culture like we

3811
02:21:28,971 --> 02:21:32,061
don't we're not wise enough to look at

3812
02:21:30,740 --> 02:21:34,130
an institution like marriage and to

3813
02:21:32,061 --> 02:21:36,681
really think about what it means and

3814
02:21:34,130 --> 02:21:38,150
what it signifies it signifies a place

3815
02:21:36,681 --> 02:21:39,650
that people could tie the ropes of their

3816
02:21:38,150 --> 02:21:41,120
lives together so that they're stronger

3817
02:21:39,650 --> 02:21:42,530
it signifies a place where people can

3818
02:21:41,120 --> 02:21:44,780
tell the truth to one another it

3819
02:21:42,530 --> 02:21:46,971
signifies a place where sexuality can

3820
02:21:44,780 --> 02:21:49,880
properly be integrated into life that's

3821
02:21:46,971 --> 02:21:51,771
no easy that's no easy task it's a place

3822
02:21:49,880 --> 02:21:53,511
where children at least in principle can

3823
02:21:51,771 --> 02:21:56,721
be put first and foremost as they should

3824
02:21:53,511 --> 02:22:00,380
be once they exist and so there's a much

3825
02:21:56,721 --> 02:22:03,801
broader discussion that has to happen I

3826
02:22:00,380 --> 02:22:05,601
think before any concentration on the

3827
02:22:03,801 --> 02:22:07,521
legality of abortion is liable to get

3828
02:22:05,601 --> 02:22:09,801
anywhere at all that's what it looks

3829
02:22:07,521 --> 02:22:12,700
like to me so that's the best I can do

3830
02:22:09,801 --> 02:22:12,700
with that question

3831
02:22:20,641 --> 02:22:26,891
hi dr. Peterson earlier you showed a

3832
02:22:24,190 --> 02:22:30,580
picture of [ __ ] seein nua yeah right uh

3833
02:22:26,891 --> 02:22:33,730
and and Osiris and in your maps of

3834
02:22:30,580 --> 02:22:35,591
meaning like yes you also explained that

3835
02:22:33,730 --> 02:22:37,240
cultures around the world have these

3836
02:22:35,591 --> 02:22:39,370
twin snakes there yeah they're

3837
02:22:37,240 --> 02:22:41,320
everywhere man yeah and so you mentioned

3838
02:22:39,370 --> 02:22:43,841
that you believe this is a

3839
02:22:41,320 --> 02:22:45,370
representation of DNA you would bring

3840
02:22:43,841 --> 02:22:48,311
that up to Jesus what is it with you

3841
02:22:45,370 --> 02:22:50,021
guys tonight huh yeah well yeah no I

3842
02:22:48,311 --> 02:22:52,091
wouldn't say I believe that I have my

3843
02:22:50,021 --> 02:22:53,980
suspicions that that might be it yeah

3844
02:22:52,091 --> 02:22:57,271
because believe is too strong a word but

3845
02:22:53,980 --> 02:22:59,860
those representations are everywhere and

3846
02:22:57,271 --> 02:23:02,471
read this book this is a good one

3847
02:22:59,860 --> 02:23:04,721
oh man now I have to remember the book

3848
02:23:02,471 --> 02:23:06,940
it's by an anthropologist who went down

3849
02:23:04,721 --> 02:23:09,341
to the Amazon jungle and experimented

3850
02:23:06,940 --> 02:23:11,320
intensively with ayahuasca I think it's

3851
02:23:09,341 --> 02:23:12,761
called the cosmic serpent I think that's

3852
02:23:11,320 --> 02:23:14,591
the name of the book you could read that

3853
02:23:12,761 --> 02:23:16,181
there's another one called breaking open

3854
02:23:14,591 --> 02:23:18,400
the head which is also pretty damn

3855
02:23:16,181 --> 02:23:21,610
interesting and there's something to

3856
02:23:18,400 --> 02:23:23,650
those books I mean the cosmic serpent

3857
02:23:21,610 --> 02:23:24,881
kind of goes off on a bit of a tangent I

3858
02:23:23,650 --> 02:23:29,980
would say although breaking open the

3859
02:23:24,881 --> 02:23:32,080
head is it's better better it seems to

3860
02:23:29,980 --> 02:23:35,891
stay more constrained and tight but

3861
02:23:32,080 --> 02:23:37,811
there's we don't know the limits of our

3862
02:23:35,891 --> 02:23:39,881
perception and especially under certain

3863
02:23:37,811 --> 02:23:43,660
conditions and I think people have had

3864
02:23:39,881 --> 02:23:49,211
intimations of DNA as the cosmic serpent

3865
02:23:43,660 --> 02:23:52,601
for ever so yeah but that's a like

3866
02:23:49,211 --> 02:23:55,360
that's way out on the frontiers of my

3867
02:23:52,601 --> 02:23:57,790
knowledge right like I'm guessing in a

3868
02:23:55,360 --> 02:24:06,000
dreamlike way when I'm making statements

3869
02:23:57,790 --> 02:24:09,641
like that so some some dreams and

3870
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:16,181
interpretations that we could have

3871
02:24:09,641 --> 02:24:18,490
perceived as it is right well yes we did

3872
02:24:16,181 --> 02:24:20,980
we didn't objectively but I'm not so

3873
02:24:18,490 --> 02:24:22,540
sure we didn't subjectively but and

3874
02:24:20,980 --> 02:24:24,370
means very strange that these that these

3875
02:24:22,540 --> 02:24:25,811
double helixes exist in so many places

3876
02:24:24,370 --> 02:24:29,341
and that they're often utilized as

3877
02:24:25,811 --> 02:24:32,471
healing symbols with the snake so

3878
02:24:29,341 --> 02:24:33,371
anyways like I said that's what do you

3879
02:24:32,471 --> 02:24:38,141
call that

3880
02:24:33,371 --> 02:24:40,360
I'm it's not hypothesizing it's one

3881
02:24:38,141 --> 02:24:42,551
thing worse than that speculating those

3882
02:24:40,360 --> 02:24:46,480
are speculations I'm I'm operating at

3883
02:24:42,551 --> 02:24:48,701
the edge of my understanding but our

3884
02:24:46,480 --> 02:24:51,251
perceptions can are very mutable and

3885
02:24:48,701 --> 02:24:52,931
they can we can see things under some

3886
02:24:51,251 --> 02:24:58,440
conditions that you wouldn't think that

3887
02:24:52,931 --> 02:24:58,440
anybody could see so okay yep

3888
02:25:03,431 --> 02:25:09,251
so I have a thought while you're talking

3889
02:25:07,001 --> 02:25:11,621
about sort of getting to the end of the

3890
02:25:09,251 --> 02:25:15,221
talk about the snake and in the Apple

3891
02:25:11,621 --> 02:25:19,001
and so on so is what you're saying is

3892
02:25:15,221 --> 02:25:21,190
the moment that that that Adam and Eve

3893
02:25:19,001 --> 02:25:22,451
eat the Apple they become nervous or

3894
02:25:21,190 --> 02:25:24,101
whatever so that's awareness of their

3895
02:25:22,451 --> 02:25:25,690
own vulnerability so then like you said

3896
02:25:24,101 --> 02:25:28,301
it's also awareness of their own

3897
02:25:25,690 --> 02:25:29,831
capacity to do harm so it's like when

3898
02:25:28,301 --> 02:25:33,851
they were eating the Apple then that's

3899
02:25:29,831 --> 02:25:35,771
them their immediate sort of nervous

3900
02:25:33,851 --> 02:25:38,141
reaction is is because they ate the

3901
02:25:35,771 --> 02:25:39,400
Apple and they kind of became evil in

3902
02:25:38,141 --> 02:25:41,860
that moment or something like that

3903
02:25:39,400 --> 02:25:43,571
well they woke up and because they they

3904
02:25:41,860 --> 02:25:45,491
woke up and realized how they could be

3905
02:25:43,571 --> 02:25:47,761
hurt how they could and would be hurt

3906
02:25:45,491 --> 02:25:50,831
over the over the over the upcoming

3907
02:25:47,761 --> 02:25:52,931
overtime it's the same as the discovery

3908
02:25:50,831 --> 02:25:55,721
of the discovery of your own nakedness

3909
02:25:52,931 --> 02:26:01,900
and the discovery of time are very very

3910
02:25:55,721 --> 02:26:03,881
similar phenomena I mean sure as soon as

3911
02:26:01,900 --> 02:26:05,591
you know how you can be hurt well you

3912
02:26:03,881 --> 02:26:07,571
know if you have to just consult your

3913
02:26:05,591 --> 02:26:09,341
evil fantasies it's like what'll really

3914
02:26:07,571 --> 02:26:10,961
hurt him oh yeah that would work it's

3915
02:26:09,341 --> 02:26:13,121
like how do you know that well you just

3916
02:26:10,961 --> 02:26:13,900
think about it what would happen if that

3917
02:26:13,121 --> 02:26:15,521
happened to me

3918
02:26:13,900 --> 02:26:19,031
that would hurt oh yeah that'll work

3919
02:26:15,521 --> 02:26:20,771
it'll hurt him or her and you know you

3920
02:26:19,031 --> 02:26:22,751
probably think that way twice a week or

3921
02:26:20,771 --> 02:26:24,161
maybe twice a day Jesus every time you

3922
02:26:22,751 --> 02:26:25,480
have an argument with someone all you

3923
02:26:24,161 --> 02:26:27,581
have to do is look at the back of your

3924
02:26:25,480 --> 02:26:29,591
mind a little bit you don't want to

3925
02:26:27,581 --> 02:26:31,571
that's for sure but if you do you'll see

3926
02:26:29,591 --> 02:26:34,991
these sorts of thought process is

3927
02:26:31,571 --> 02:26:36,581
generating constantly it's like you know

3928
02:26:34,991 --> 02:26:38,531
in a back-and-forth discussion

3929
02:26:36,581 --> 02:26:39,491
particularly with people you love it's

3930
02:26:38,531 --> 02:26:42,240
like you're always looking for a place

3931
02:26:39,491 --> 02:26:44,250
to put the knife in

3932
02:26:42,240 --> 02:26:45,840
so then it seems really similar to me or

3933
02:26:44,250 --> 02:26:47,670
seems like they're kind of discovering

3934
02:26:45,840 --> 02:26:49,141
the kind of like Union shadow within

3935
02:26:47,670 --> 02:26:51,330
themselves so that that is the moment

3936
02:26:49,141 --> 02:26:54,391
where it got introduced into the human

3937
02:26:51,330 --> 02:26:56,550
spirit sure one of the things about the

3938
02:26:54,391 --> 02:26:57,960
shadow is that it's also when you

3939
02:26:56,550 --> 02:27:01,860
integrate that that's what makes you a

3940
02:26:57,960 --> 02:27:03,420
substantial person right no it's like it

3941
02:27:01,860 --> 02:27:05,280
seems to me that on one hand well it's

3942
02:27:03,420 --> 02:27:07,260
it seems like this tragedy that Satan

3943
02:27:05,280 --> 02:27:09,840
the most evil the father of evil

3944
02:27:07,260 --> 02:27:12,150
whatever has introduced into people but

3945
02:27:09,840 --> 02:27:16,141
it also seems like without that shadow

3946
02:27:12,150 --> 02:27:18,811
that people are kind of insubstantial so

3947
02:27:16,141 --> 02:27:21,750
yeah well duh right right I mean that

3948
02:27:18,811 --> 02:27:24,780
like I said that there's been a

3949
02:27:21,750 --> 02:27:26,641
multitude of interpretations emerge as a

3950
02:27:24,780 --> 02:27:29,130
consequence of that story what was God

3951
02:27:26,641 --> 02:27:31,950
up to was was God in fact evil the

3952
02:27:29,130 --> 02:27:33,750
initial God like why would he create a

3953
02:27:31,950 --> 02:27:35,880
snake why would he put it in the garden

3954
02:27:33,750 --> 02:27:37,771
why would there be these trees what the

3955
02:27:35,880 --> 02:27:39,540
hell is going on with the whole Satan

3956
02:27:37,771 --> 02:27:41,880
thing you know it's very very

3957
02:27:39,540 --> 02:27:46,021
problematic well we'll talk about it

3958
02:27:41,880 --> 02:27:53,760
more and this again is let's call it

3959
02:27:46,021 --> 02:27:57,090
speculation well if you want to make

3960
02:27:53,760 --> 02:27:58,380
something strong you test it and maybe

3961
02:27:57,090 --> 02:28:01,891
if you want to make something ultimately

3962
02:27:58,380 --> 02:28:04,190
strong you test it ultimately and I

3963
02:28:01,891 --> 02:28:07,800
think that there's an aspect of being

3964
02:28:04,190 --> 02:28:11,490
that has that element is that human

3965
02:28:07,800 --> 02:28:13,080
beings are tested ultimately it's partly

3966
02:28:11,490 --> 02:28:15,540
because we know good and good and evil

3967
02:28:13,080 --> 02:28:18,510
now and so that's the landscape in which

3968
02:28:15,540 --> 02:28:21,090
we exist so you could say the landscape

3969
02:28:18,510 --> 02:28:22,530
is across its chaos and order and it's

3970
02:28:21,090 --> 02:28:23,971
good and evil and we're stuck in the

3971
02:28:22,530 --> 02:28:25,260
middle between those two things it's a

3972
02:28:23,971 --> 02:28:28,050
very common theme by the way in

3973
02:28:25,260 --> 02:28:30,061
videogames exactly that chaos order good

3974
02:28:28,050 --> 02:28:31,800
evil it's that it's the basic plot of

3975
02:28:30,061 --> 02:28:34,290
endless video games and that's perhaps

3976
02:28:31,800 --> 02:28:36,570
because it's the basic plot those are

3977
02:28:34,290 --> 02:28:39,420
the things we have to contend with well

3978
02:28:36,570 --> 02:28:42,330
I had a vision once I shouldn't tell you

3979
02:28:39,420 --> 02:28:44,550
this but I will anyways I had a vision

3980
02:28:42,330 --> 02:28:47,730
once that that I went to heaven and I

3981
02:28:44,550 --> 02:28:52,141
was put in a in a Roman amphitheater

3982
02:28:47,730 --> 02:28:53,730
with Satan just like Thor encountering

3983
02:28:52,141 --> 02:28:56,280
the Hulk right that's coming up in that

3984
02:28:53,730 --> 02:28:57,540
new Avengers movie and so it was

3985
02:28:56,280 --> 02:28:59,011
a shark because I thought there was a

3986
02:28:57,540 --> 02:29:03,120
hell of a thing to happen in heaven and

3987
02:28:59,011 --> 02:29:05,370
so I had this battle and I won and at

3988
02:29:03,120 --> 02:29:09,300
the end I came up to God and said like

3989
02:29:05,370 --> 02:29:10,771
you know what's with the whole Roman

3990
02:29:09,300 --> 02:29:13,320
amphitheater thing there it seemed like

3991
02:29:10,771 --> 02:29:15,420
it over the top to me said why would you

3992
02:29:13,320 --> 02:29:17,641
put me in a ring with some one thing

3993
02:29:15,420 --> 02:29:20,940
like that and he said because I knew you

3994
02:29:17,641 --> 02:29:24,990
could win and you know I don't know what

3995
02:29:20,940 --> 02:29:26,340
to make of that one thing I should teach

3996
02:29:24,990 --> 02:29:29,420
you should make of it as I shouldn't

3997
02:29:26,340 --> 02:29:31,891
tell you but whatever but you know

3998
02:29:29,420 --> 02:29:34,920
there's something there's something to

3999
02:29:31,891 --> 02:29:36,360
that in my estimation it's like do you

4000
02:29:34,920 --> 02:29:38,971
protect the people you love or do you

4001
02:29:36,360 --> 02:29:41,130
try to make them strong so you think

4002
02:29:38,971 --> 02:29:43,230
it's that it's not that we have like

4003
02:29:41,130 --> 02:29:46,920
Satan to thank for making us substantial

4004
02:29:43,230 --> 02:29:48,061
it's that God gave us Satan in order to

4005
02:29:46,920 --> 02:29:49,920
make us substantial

4006
02:29:48,061 --> 02:29:52,710
well I'd hesitate to say that because

4007
02:29:49,920 --> 02:29:55,290
you know it's it's so cut and dried but

4008
02:29:52,710 --> 02:29:57,840
I would say that there's a that's a

4009
02:29:55,290 --> 02:30:01,500
strong underlying theme in the biblical

4010
02:29:57,840 --> 02:30:03,090
narrative yes now it's certainly not the

4011
02:30:01,500 --> 02:30:04,530
only scene it's not the only

4012
02:30:03,090 --> 02:30:06,570
interpretation by any stretch of the

4013
02:30:04,530 --> 02:30:07,500
imagination but there is something there

4014
02:30:06,570 --> 02:30:09,721
and there's something there you know at

4015
02:30:07,500 --> 02:30:12,391
the end we didn't talk about this God

4016
02:30:09,721 --> 02:30:14,550
puts up this flaming sword and these

4017
02:30:12,391 --> 02:30:18,840
cherubim to keep you away from the tree

4018
02:30:14,550 --> 02:30:20,700
of life it's like it's seem if paradise

4019
02:30:18,840 --> 02:30:23,761
and immortality are the promised land

4020
02:30:20,700 --> 02:30:25,290
and what's with the whole flaming angel

4021
02:30:23,761 --> 02:30:27,780
and sword thing we could have just had

4022
02:30:25,290 --> 02:30:30,240
the damn fruit five thousand years ago

4023
02:30:27,780 --> 02:30:32,400
and not bothered with the problem well

4024
02:30:30,240 --> 02:30:36,320
it seems to me that there's something

4025
02:30:32,400 --> 02:30:39,420
like I don't know what it is

4026
02:30:36,320 --> 02:30:41,400
consciousness through tragedy clarity

4027
02:30:39,420 --> 02:30:44,730
through suffering maybe something like

4028
02:30:41,400 --> 02:30:46,590
that or maybe the perfection that lurks

4029
02:30:44,730 --> 02:30:48,000
as a potential in the future is

4030
02:30:46,590 --> 02:30:50,311
something that has to be earned rather

4031
02:30:48,000 --> 02:30:52,920
than given maybe it has no value without

4032
02:30:50,311 --> 02:30:54,360
free choice maybe we have to distinguish

4033
02:30:52,920 --> 02:30:56,521
between good and evil now that we have

4034
02:30:54,360 --> 02:30:58,590
the capacity to actually apprehend them

4035
02:30:56,521 --> 02:31:00,300
maybe that's what life is about

4036
02:30:58,590 --> 02:31:01,771
maybe that's the separating of the wheat

4037
02:31:00,300 --> 02:31:03,690
from the chaff see that's the idea in

4038
02:31:01,771 --> 02:31:06,540
Revelation right because when Christ

4039
02:31:03,690 --> 02:31:08,700
comes back in the book of Revelation he

4040
02:31:06,540 --> 02:31:09,750
divides the Damned from the saved and

4041
02:31:08,700 --> 02:31:12,900
the same

4042
02:31:09,750 --> 02:31:14,550
the people who lived in logos roughly

4043
02:31:12,900 --> 02:31:16,560
speaking and and the Damned or those who

4044
02:31:14,550 --> 02:31:18,650
don't and so there's this idea that

4045
02:31:16,560 --> 02:31:20,940
there's this dynamic that underlies

4046
02:31:18,650 --> 02:31:24,960
experience that is in fact that's

4047
02:31:20,940 --> 02:31:30,060
sorting now I don't know what to make of

4048
02:31:24,960 --> 02:31:32,940
that at all but that's the story but

4049
02:31:30,060 --> 02:31:35,550
what I can make of that is that I I

4050
02:31:32,940 --> 02:31:38,250
can't put a lever underneath the

4051
02:31:35,550 --> 02:31:40,980
argument that I just made tonight about

4052
02:31:38,250 --> 02:31:43,970
the relationship between the development

4053
02:31:40,980 --> 02:31:47,340
of vision the snake the fruit nakedness

4054
02:31:43,970 --> 02:31:49,710
time the future work and most

4055
02:31:47,340 --> 02:31:53,210
importantly the emergence of evil that

4056
02:31:49,710 --> 02:31:57,570
seems to me to be I cannot find a way to

4057
02:31:53,210 --> 02:31:58,800
undermine that argument it seems I can't

4058
02:31:57,570 --> 02:32:00,510
break it and that's what I'm always

4059
02:31:58,800 --> 02:32:02,220
looking for when I'm trying to formulate

4060
02:32:00,510 --> 02:32:04,590
ideas I'm trying to look for something

4061
02:32:02,220 --> 02:32:06,780
that no matter how hard I try I cannot

4062
02:32:04,590 --> 02:32:09,780
break and I can't break that set of

4063
02:32:06,780 --> 02:32:12,210
ideas now what the full implication is

4064
02:32:09,780 --> 02:32:20,670
of that set of ideas god only knows

4065
02:32:12,210 --> 02:32:22,380
right but but I could say also

4066
02:32:20,670 --> 02:32:25,800
practically you know one of the things

4067
02:32:22,380 --> 02:32:27,720
that I've observed is that lies and

4068
02:32:25,800 --> 02:32:29,730
deception destroy people's lives and

4069
02:32:27,720 --> 02:32:34,100
when they start telling the truth and

4070
02:32:29,730 --> 02:32:35,610
acting it out things get a lot better

4071
02:32:34,100 --> 02:32:43,729
gotta stop

4072
02:32:35,610 --> 02:32:45,789
[Applause]

4073
02:32:43,729 --> 02:32:45,789
you
