2
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:25,080
thank you so I look today and these

3
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:28,640
lectures have now been watched by

4
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:37,710
they've been viewed a million times so

5
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:39,840
that's pretty amazing freely or they've

6
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:43,040
been they've been glanced at a million

7
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:45,899
times that's right that's also possible

8
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:50,820
all right so well let's get right into

9
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:53,730
it so last week I think was mostly

10
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,440
remarkable for the absolute dearth of

11
00:00:53,730 --> 00:01:00,329
content that was actually biblically

12
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:05,220
related so that was I'll just recap what

13
00:01:00,329 --> 00:01:07,020
I laid out and so that it sets the frame

14
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:14,280
properly for what we're going to discuss

15
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:18,030
tonight and I presented you with an

16
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:19,979
elaborated description of of this

17
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:22,640
diagram essentially which I spent quite

18
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:25,500
a lot of time formulating probably about

19
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:27,420
25 years ago I guess which kind of

20
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:31,259
accounts for its graphic primitiveness I

21
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:33,780
suppose I was really pushing the limits

22
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:38,400
of my 486 computer to produce that I can

23
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:40,500
tell you so and it's it's it's a it's a

24
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,820
description representation of the

25
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:46,439
archetypal circumstances of life and and

26
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:48,720
the archetypical circumstances are the

27
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:53,640
circumstances that are true under all

28
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:55,110
conditions for all time and so you can

29
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,030
think about them as descriptively

30
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:59,610
characteristic of the nature of human

31
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:04,770
experience that's not exactly the same

32
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:08,160
as the nature of reality but because you

33
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:10,080
can you can divide reality into its

34
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,569
subject of an object of elements and and

35
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,219
there's utility in doing that but

36
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:15,989
these sorts of representations don't

37
00:02:14,219 --> 00:02:22,920
play that game that they consider human

38
00:02:15,989 --> 00:02:25,560
experience as constituted constitutive

39
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:27,659
of reality and that's how we experience

40
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:30,209
it and so we'll just go with that the

41
00:02:27,659 --> 00:02:33,139
idea basically is is that we always

42
00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:38,099
exist inside a damaged structure and

43
00:02:33,139 --> 00:02:40,169
that structure is partly biological and

44
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:41,900
it's it's partly socio-cultural it's

45
00:02:40,169 --> 00:02:46,500
partly what's been handed to us by our

46
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:48,379
by our ancestors both practically in

47
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:51,989
terms of infrastructure but also

48
00:02:48,379 --> 00:02:55,379
psychologically in terms of the active

49
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:57,689
learned content of our of our psyches

50
00:02:55,379 --> 00:03:01,019
and so that would include for example

51
00:02:57,689 --> 00:03:03,090
our ability to utilize language and the

52
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:04,889
words that we use and the phrases that

53
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:06,180
we use and the mutual understanding that

54
00:03:04,889 --> 00:03:10,109
we develop as a consequence of

55
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:13,919
interacting with each other architect

56
00:03:10,109 --> 00:03:17,579
Lee speaking that structures always it's

57
00:03:13,919 --> 00:03:18,930
always dead and corrupt and the reason

58
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:20,729
it's dead is because it was made by

59
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:23,639
people who are dead and the reason it's

60
00:03:20,729 --> 00:03:26,099
corrupt is because things fall apart of

61
00:03:23,639 --> 00:03:28,699
their own accord and the fact that

62
00:03:26,099 --> 00:03:30,780
people don't aim properly let's say

63
00:03:28,699 --> 00:03:33,169
speeds along that process of

64
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:37,189
degeneration and so what that means and

65
00:03:33,169 --> 00:03:39,629
I think this is something worth knowing

66
00:03:37,189 --> 00:03:43,290
maybe I'll try standing back here and

67
00:03:39,629 --> 00:03:47,400
see if that problem goes away what that

68
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:51,150
means is that young people always have a

69
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:54,030
reason to be upset and cynical about the

70
00:03:51,150 --> 00:03:57,299
current state of affairs and and it's

71
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:59,159
that way forever and so it's useful I

72
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:00,750
think to consider such considerations

73
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:02,699
sort of such conceptualizations of the

74
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:04,500
pair of the as the patriarchy in that

75
00:04:02,699 --> 00:04:07,949
light because it's an archetypal truth

76
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:10,500
that the social structure is corrupt and

77
00:04:07,949 --> 00:04:11,549
incomplete and and what that means is

78
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:15,180
that it's something that you have to

79
00:04:11,549 --> 00:04:18,000
contend with every moment in some sense

80
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:21,810
of your life it's a it's a permanent

81
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,800
fact of existence and to be upset that

82
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:24,800
the

83
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:29,010
structures of social structures or even

84
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:33,030
the biological structures within which

85
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:35,250
we live are incomplete and imperfect is

86
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:36,720
to and to take that personally that

87
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:39,450
that's the worst part of it to take that

88
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,450
person out personally is a misreading of

89
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:44,610
the existential condition of humankind

90
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:46,950
because it's always the case that what

91
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:50,310
you have been given and what you live in

92
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:54,840
is degenerate and corrupt and in need of

93
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:57,720
repair and it's easier just to accept

94
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,100
that because there's also a positive

95
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,330
development and the pause development as

96
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:06,180
well you've been granted something

97
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:07,920
rather than nothing and maybe you

98
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:10,320
haven't been granted pure hell because

99
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:12,210
especially in a culture like ours where

100
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,310
many things actually function quite well

101
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:16,080
so there's room for gratitude there even

102
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:17,460
if it's a broken machine it's not one

103
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,490
that's completely devastated and it's

104
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:22,830
not absolutely hell-bent at every second

105
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:24,930
on your misery and destruction and it

106
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:26,970
easily could be because many societies

107
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:29,610
are like that and so the fact that we

108
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:32,550
happen to live in one that isn't corrupt

109
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:37,050
beyond imagining is something to be

110
00:05:32,550 --> 00:05:40,080
eternally grateful for well so we live

111
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:41,730
inside a damaged structure and we also

112
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:45,690
bear responsibility for that damage

113
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:49,590
because we don't do everything we can to

114
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:50,580
constantly repair it and you might say

115
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:52,470
well that's actually one of the

116
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:54,540
fundamental you know people say well

117
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:55,770
what's the meaning of life what they

118
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:57,060
really mean is what's the positive

119
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:58,620
meaning of life because as we've already

120
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:00,750
discussed the negative meanings of life

121
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:02,430
are more or less self-evident well the

122
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:05,910
positive meaning of life is to be found

123
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:08,610
in noting the state of lack of repair of

124
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:12,300
the of the walled city that you inhabit

125
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:14,910
and then sallying forth to do something

126
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:17,160
about that to repair the breaches and to

127
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:21,780
fix up the walls and to make the

128
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:26,450
structure that you inhabit as secure and

129
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:29,550
as productive as it possibly can be and

130
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:30,060
there's no shortage of opportunities to

131
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:33,450
do that

132
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:35,070
you can do that in your own mind you can

133
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:37,050
do that in your own room you can do that

134
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:37,780
in your own household in your local

135
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:40,000
community

136
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:42,280
you and maybe if you get good at doing

137
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,590
it at all those levels then you can

138
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:46,480
start to look beyond that and so there's

139
00:06:44,590 --> 00:06:48,070
challenges that's the thing that's kind

140
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,870
of interesting about this insufficient

141
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:52,180
structure is that it has a set of

142
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:54,070
challenges built into it because of its

143
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:57,910
insufficiency and perhaps even because

144
00:06:54,070 --> 00:07:00,130
of its corrupt nature that calls forth

145
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:02,139
the potential response from you of

146
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:04,750
heroic adventure and the heroic

147
00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:09,580
adventure is to man the barricades and

148
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:11,260
repair the city and you can always do

149
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:13,390
that it doesn't matter what's what your

150
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:15,760
personal circumstances are there's

151
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:18,070
always something that isn't right

152
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:20,380
near you isn't correct isn't laid out

153
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:22,750
properly that you could just fix if you

154
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:25,180
wanted to and one of the things that

155
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:30,340
we're going to talk about tonight is the

156
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:32,919
idea that if you adopt the attitude an

157
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:35,200
attitude that's like that that the rule

158
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:37,720
that you should play is to make things

159
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:40,300
better wherever you are however you can

160
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:42,070
that what would actually happen would be

161
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:44,350
that things would get better wherever

162
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:47,380
you are in all sorts of ways and that

163
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:50,560
we've really as a species you might say

164
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:53,770
or maybe even as singular individuals we

165
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,060
we've explored that rarely it isn't

166
00:07:53,770 --> 00:07:57,430
something that's put forth as a

167
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:59,919
proposition that often and it's quite

168
00:07:57,430 --> 00:08:01,360
surprising to me and you know I had an

169
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:04,060
interesting experience the other day I

170
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,380
went to the keg I go there because I

171
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,880
have food allergies and they're very

172
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:09,760
careful with people who have food

173
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:11,140
allergies and the waiter took me to the

174
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:14,050
table and he said that he had been

175
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:17,710
watching my lectures and that's a very

176
00:08:14,050 --> 00:08:19,330
common experience and he was happy about

177
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:21,130
that and he said that he had two

178
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:23,140
promotions at the keg in the last four

179
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:25,240
months because he'd been watching my

180
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:28,150
lectures and like I really found that an

181
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:29,800
affecting experience because you know

182
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:31,180
you might say well he's working as a

183
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:34,150
waiter at the keg and there's nothing

184
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:36,280
particularly heroic about that and and I

185
00:08:34,150 --> 00:08:38,349
disagree with that actually because I

186
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:40,150
don't care where you're located you can

187
00:08:38,349 --> 00:08:42,580
do a hell of a job and I mean that

188
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:44,320
literally at whatever job you have you

189
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:45,970
can you can take whatever job you have

190
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:49,209
and you can make it a real nice little

191
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:51,820
piece of absolute misery or you can do

192
00:08:49,209 --> 00:08:54,250
you can act like a civilized human being

193
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:56,320
and notice that no matter where you are

194
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:57,840
there's a there's a richness and a

195
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:01,150
complexity that's completely

196
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:02,800
inexhaustible right at hand and then you

197
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:06,220
can take that seriously and you can say

198
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:08,530
well I happen to be a waiter at the keg

199
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:10,660
and perhaps that's not what I expected

200
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:12,550
and he's a young guy and perhaps that

201
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:14,620
isn't where I want to end up but it's

202
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:17,020
not nothing that's a rich environment

203
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:18,670
and I can make it a lot better if I want

204
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:20,440
to I can get along properly with my

205
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:22,330
co-workers and not gossip behind their

206
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:24,760
back and I can treat my customers

207
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:27,430
properly and if an opportunity comes my

208
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:30,250
way I can take it and I can see what

209
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:31,900
happens and so he said that's what he

210
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:33,520
had started doing and that things were

211
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:35,890
working out much better for him he was

212
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:37,090
in a much better job than he was three

213
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:39,100
months ago in three months that's

214
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:41,290
nothing right I mean that's a nice

215
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:43,870
trajectory it's an uphill trajectory and

216
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:45,580
that's what you want really an uphill

217
00:09:43,870 --> 00:09:47,230
trajectory is actually even better than

218
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:49,270
being somewhere good as far as I'm

219
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:50,800
concerned because one of the things that

220
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:52,870
really makes your life meaningful is the

221
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,610
clear realization that you're headed

222
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:56,350
somewhere better than you are now and

223
00:09:54,610 --> 00:09:58,030
then it's even better if you also

224
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:59,860
understand that there's a direct causal

225
00:09:58,030 --> 00:10:01,900
relationship between the things that

226
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:04,120
you're doing and the steepness of that

227
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:05,920
incline and so I get a lot of letters

228
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:08,110
from people like that and they're Marse

229
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:10,330
most frequently young men although not

230
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:12,490
always and they say well you know I've

231
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:13,870
been listening to these lectures and I

232
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:16,030
decided that I'm going to try to take

233
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:19,210
responsibility for my life and so I'm

234
00:10:16,030 --> 00:10:21,040
I've started to stop doing all the

235
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:22,690
stupid things that I know that that are

236
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,550
stupid that I know I shouldn't be doing

237
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:25,960
and I've started doing some of the

238
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:27,220
things that aren't stupid that I know I

239
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:29,710
should be doing which seems pretty

240
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:32,020
obvious really if you think about it but

241
00:10:29,710 --> 00:10:33,700
it's obvious though it may be that isn't

242
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:35,530
necessarily what people do and then they

243
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:37,300
write and say you can't believe what

244
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:39,040
difference that makes and they're

245
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:40,420
thrilled about it and so I'm thrilled

246
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,940
about it when I get letters like that

247
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:45,910
because I really don't experience

248
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:48,040
anything as better than a letter like

249
00:10:45,910 --> 00:10:51,190
that or a message like that because it's

250
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:54,130
so good to see things that aren't so

251
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:55,900
good replaced by something better and I

252
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:57,850
really do think it's an open question I

253
00:10:55,900 --> 00:11:00,310
truly believe it's an open question to

254
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:02,260
what degree we could make things better

255
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:04,210
if that's what we actually aimed at

256
00:11:02,260 --> 00:11:05,470
doing you know in some of the stories

257
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:07,450
that we've we've come

258
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:09,460
already the story of Cain and Abel in

259
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:11,890
particular is really an analysis of that

260
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:14,590
problem which so remarkable it occurs so

261
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:18,430
so early in this document it's such a

262
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:20,200
such a foundational story and it

263
00:11:18,430 --> 00:11:21,610
basically says well there's two modes of

264
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:25,410
being in the world right there's one

265
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:29,860
where you adopt the responsibility for

266
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:31,660
living properly for being properly and

267
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:33,340
you make the sacrifices necessary for

268
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:35,950
doing that and then everything will

269
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:38,440
flourish properly and the other one is a

270
00:11:35,950 --> 00:11:41,320
pathway of resentment and bitterness and

271
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:43,900
rejection and murder and genocide and

272
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:48,130
that just seems exactly right to me and

273
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:49,930
so if the positive path beckons if you

274
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:52,750
can actually see what it is if you can

275
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:53,320
if you can lower yourself enough to see

276
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,510
what it is

277
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,950
young Carl Jung said once that modern

278
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:58,870
people didn't see God because they

279
00:11:56,950 --> 00:12:00,450
didn't look low enough so phrase I

280
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:02,620
really really like because people

281
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:04,780
denigrate the opportunities that are

282
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:06,670
right in front of them and there's no

283
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:09,040
reason to do that because what's right

284
00:12:06,670 --> 00:12:10,560
in front of you is the majesty of being

285
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,970
that's what's right in front of you it's

286
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,710
inexhaustibly complex and full of

287
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:16,870
potential and there's no reason to

288
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:19,330
assume that wherever you happen to be

289
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:21,550
isn't as good a starting place as

290
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:23,620
anywhere else now you know I know some

291
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:25,000
people have terrible terrible lives in

292
00:12:23,620 --> 00:12:27,610
situations that are absolutely

293
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,350
unbearable and but I also do know that

294
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:32,020
even situations like that can be made a

295
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:34,480
hell of a lot worse by the bad by by the

296
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:37,000
worst kind of attitude that's for sure

297
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,650
so so anyway so that's where you are

298
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:40,450
you're in a damaged structure you're a

299
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:43,660
damaged structure you're in a damaged

300
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:45,910
structure but you know at least it's got

301
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:47,770
some walls you know you're not being fed

302
00:12:45,910 --> 00:12:49,540
to the Lions on a regular basis so

303
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:53,040
that's a good thing and you can you can

304
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:55,690
emerge forward you know heroically

305
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:57,760
magically to confront the chaos that

306
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:59,470
constantly threatens the structure

307
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,390
within which you live and you can free

308
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:03,640
something as a consequence of that you

309
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:04,990
can learn something you can strengthen

310
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:08,140
yourself that's the other thing because

311
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:10,840
the way what you're actually made of in

312
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:12,730
many ways that what informs you what

313
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:14,320
you're made of is what you encounter

314
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:16,480
when you voluntarily encounter the

315
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,100
unknown and so the more you voluntarily

316
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,520
encounter the unknown the more you get

317
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:20,260
may

318
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:21,940
and the more you get made of the more

319
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:24,250
there is to you and then the more you're

320
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:26,830
good at encountering the unknown and

321
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:29,740
restructuring order and and calling

322
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:32,260
forth proper order out of the potential

323
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:34,600
of being and God you got to think why

324
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:36,580
wouldn't you do that since you can do

325
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,280
that and it's an endless mystery you

326
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:41,410
know I think part of it is that people

327
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:42,970
well it's also encapsulated to stump

328
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:44,620
some degree in the story of Adam and Eve

329
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:46,390
because what happens to Adam is when he

330
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:49,030
becomes self conscious right

331
00:13:46,390 --> 00:13:50,980
he becomes ashamed of himself and

332
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:52,630
regards himself as a lowly sort of

333
00:13:50,980 --> 00:13:54,130
creature and there's endless reasons why

334
00:13:52,630 --> 00:13:56,590
people would do that because of course

335
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:58,210
we're rife with imperfection and so he

336
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:59,980
hides from God and I think that's

337
00:13:58,210 --> 00:14:03,610
actually the answer to the conundrum

338
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:06,250
which is that people don't aspire to the

339
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:09,340
highest good because they're deeply

340
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:11,260
ashamed of themselves and their

341
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:13,750
weaknesses and their insufficiencies and

342
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:15,970
and so it's it's that's not the only

343
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:17,920
reason I mean there's the desire to

344
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:20,200
avoid responsibility and there's all the

345
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:23,080
negative motivations as well like

346
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:25,090
resentment and and and hatred and the

347
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:27,250
desire to make things worse I don't want

348
00:14:25,090 --> 00:14:29,890
to you know give us a give us too much

349
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:34,090
of a break but but it's something like

350
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:35,590
that but it's okay then to not be in a

351
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:37,420
very good place if what you're trying to

352
00:14:35,590 --> 00:14:38,980
do with that not very good place is make

353
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:40,180
it better and one of the things I really

354
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:43,030
have learned as a clinical psychologist

355
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:45,370
is that you just cannot believe how

356
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:46,810
powerful incremental progress is you

357
00:14:45,370 --> 00:14:48,970
could you can do the calculations like

358
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:50,920
it's like compound interest you know if

359
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:53,620
you make your life a tenth of a percent

360
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:55,630
better a week man in two or three years

361
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:58,360
you're in such a better place than you

362
00:14:55,630 --> 00:15:00,910
were that it isn't even like the same

363
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:02,140
domain and if you keep that up for ten

364
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:03,790
years or twenty years you know

365
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:05,170
especially if you're young and you start

366
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:07,660
early you start to straighten yourself

367
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:10,000
out and and fix the things that you can

368
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:12,760
fix you can transform your lives in ways

369
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:15,190
that are completely unimaginable and god

370
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:17,650
only knows what the upper limit of that

371
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:19,720
is in terms of human possibility because

372
00:15:17,650 --> 00:15:21,610
we are amazing creatures you know when

373
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:24,490
we really get our act together and stop

374
00:15:21,610 --> 00:15:27,520
running at 10% of our capacity you know

375
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:29,530
so so so that's what you do you've got

376
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:30,940
you know the fact that things aren't

377
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:32,410
exactly the way they should be at least

378
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:34,990
gives you something to do

379
00:15:32,410 --> 00:15:36,639
ooh you know and that's that's and and

380
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:38,170
and maybe something great to do because

381
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:40,690
there's no shortage of suffering in

382
00:15:38,170 --> 00:15:43,360
trouble that'd be sets the world that

383
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:46,839
you could conceivably ameliorate in some

384
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:48,550
way and the utility and meaning the

385
00:15:46,839 --> 00:15:51,310
utility of that and the intrinsic

386
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:54,399
meaning of that is self-evident so it

387
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:56,889
also makes me curious about nihilism for

388
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,660
example and despair because I mean I

389
00:15:56,889 --> 00:16:00,639
understand those emotions I understand

390
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:02,379
them deeply and the intellectual mindset

391
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,060
that goes along with it but they just

392
00:16:02,379 --> 00:16:06,040
seem beside the point to me in some

393
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:08,680
sense because there are so many things

394
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:10,660
that need doing that all you really have

395
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,800
to do is open your eyes and look at them

396
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:13,209
and then decide that you're actually

397
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:15,699
going to do something about them and you

398
00:16:13,209 --> 00:16:19,389
might think well what's within my scope

399
00:16:15,699 --> 00:16:21,220
of influence is so trivial that it's not

400
00:16:19,389 --> 00:16:22,899
worth doing it's like it won't stay

401
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:24,579
trivial for long if you do it

402
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:26,230
not at all and I don't think it's

403
00:16:24,579 --> 00:16:27,910
trivial to begin with I don't think that

404
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:30,970
any I really don't believe that anything

405
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:33,370
done right is trivial and my experience

406
00:16:30,970 --> 00:16:37,149
in my life has been that anything I

407
00:16:33,370 --> 00:16:39,040
actually did paid off it didn't pay off

408
00:16:37,149 --> 00:16:40,449
necessarily in the way that I expected

409
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:43,149
it to pay off that's a whole different

410
00:16:40,449 --> 00:16:45,130
story but if it was genuine commitment

411
00:16:43,149 --> 00:16:46,930
to do something even if it went sideways

412
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:48,100
and the outcome was really something

413
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:50,110
other than what I expected

414
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:54,430
the net consequence over time was

415
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:56,829
nothing but good so every new frontier

416
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:58,839
that can be conquered is an advance

417
00:16:56,829 --> 00:17:00,610
forward and there's no shortage of

418
00:16:58,839 --> 00:17:02,560
frontier because we're surrounded by the

419
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:05,319
unknown we're surrounded by our own

420
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:07,360
ignorance and we can continually move

421
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:10,539
into that domain into the domain of

422
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:13,270
chaos or we can restructure pathological

423
00:17:10,539 --> 00:17:15,939
order and that's that's the secret to

424
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:17,799
proper being and so then you encounter

425
00:17:15,939 --> 00:17:19,419
chaos that way you know and then you can

426
00:17:17,799 --> 00:17:22,120
regard yourself as the sort of entity

427
00:17:19,419 --> 00:17:25,329
that despite its insufficiency has the

428
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:26,770
capability to conquer chaos despite the

429
00:17:25,329 --> 00:17:29,049
danger of that that's the other thing

430
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:31,000
because the fact that you're fragile is

431
00:17:29,049 --> 00:17:32,650
actually a precondition for your heroism

432
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:34,059
because if you weren't fragile then

433
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:35,770
there'd be nothing heroic about doing

434
00:17:34,059 --> 00:17:37,840
something difficult right because if you

435
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:41,049
couldn't be hurt or damaged or defeated

436
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:43,270
or or end up in failure then where's the

437
00:17:41,049 --> 00:17:46,060
where's the moral courage in the

438
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:48,850
endeavor it has to be that the

439
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:50,800
agility is built into the courage and so

440
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:53,530
it's not it's not a reason not to engage

441
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:58,840
in it at all in fact quite the contrary

442
00:17:53,530 --> 00:18:00,400
and so well and so then you know what do

443
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:02,620
you do well you put the city back

444
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:04,780
together and maybe the way you want it

445
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:07,060
so that it's functional and efficient

446
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:10,180
and beautiful and so the people can

447
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:13,000
flourish there and and and flourish in a

448
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:16,630
manner that makes them like it makes

449
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:19,510
them what would you say that makes them

450
00:18:16,630 --> 00:18:22,270
feel that the unbearable catastrophe of

451
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:24,700
being is worth it for the experience

452
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:26,590
that's what you're aiming at and it's

453
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:29,470
not an impossibility it's not an

454
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:31,210
impossibility and then not only that not

455
00:18:29,470 --> 00:18:33,520
only do you repair the city when you do

456
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:35,740
that but you make yourself the sort of

457
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:38,410
thing that continually repairs the city

458
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:40,090
and that's even better that's the end

459
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:41,440
goal because it's not the repair of the

460
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:43,840
city that's the goal it's the

461
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,820
transformation of yourself into the

462
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:50,020
thing that continually repairs the city

463
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:53,290
and so there's just no reason for that

464
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:58,740
not to happen and the more it can happen

465
00:18:53,290 --> 00:19:01,090
the better well there's a there's an

466
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:03,130
undercurrent to this story and that is

467
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:05,950
also the story of the flood and that's

468
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:07,660
the fact that you know the city can

469
00:19:05,950 --> 00:19:09,190
become corrupt because people don't

470
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:11,020
engage in heroic endeavor or perhaps

471
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:13,120
because they engage in precisely the

472
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:15,400
opposite of that which is outright

473
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:17,530
destructive behavior and this is also

474
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:20,020
something that's worth considering too

475
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:25,440
because if you if you if you consider

476
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:28,030
your your own manner of being you know

477
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:30,700
you can say things to people like tell

478
00:19:28,030 --> 00:19:34,150
tell the truth and be good and those

479
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:36,010
aren't those are cliches obviously and

480
00:19:34,150 --> 00:19:38,760
so they lack power because they're

481
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:40,900
cliches but you can take them apart and

482
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:44,440
utilize them in a manner that stops

483
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:46,270
being a cliche and you do that by being

484
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:48,250
more humble about them I would say

485
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:49,570
because maybe you can't tell the truth

486
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:51,850
because you don't know what the truth is

487
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:53,440
but one thing you can do is you can stop

488
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:55,330
saying things that you know to be untrue

489
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,310
and you might say well how do I know

490
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:59,170
that they're untrue and the answer to

491
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:59,980
that is well you need a whole philosophy

492
00:19:59,170 --> 00:20:01,480
of truth

493
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:03,340
the elaboration of an entire philosophy

494
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:04,840
of truth to answer that question and so

495
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:06,669
we're not going to bother answering that

496
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:08,380
question because in some sense at the

497
00:20:06,669 --> 00:20:10,390
moment it's beside the point that isn't

498
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:11,950
the issue the issue is there are times

499
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:13,419
in your life where you know that the

500
00:20:11,950 --> 00:20:16,150
thing that you're saying is not true

501
00:20:13,419 --> 00:20:17,490
it's a deception it's a lie of some sort

502
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:19,780
and you're using it to manipulate

503
00:20:17,490 --> 00:20:21,730
yourself or another person or the world

504
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:23,230
and you're also possessed fully

505
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:25,030
possessed of the idea that you can get

506
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:27,429
away with it and there's a satanic

507
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:30,040
arrogance about that in fact that is the

508
00:20:27,429 --> 00:20:31,600
archetypal arrogance that's portrayed in

509
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:34,870
the mythological character of Satan

510
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:37,660
because Satan is precisely the archetype

511
00:20:34,870 --> 00:20:41,500
of the element of the mind that believes

512
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:43,240
that it can twist and and bend the

513
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:45,340
structure reality without paying the

514
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:46,660
price for that and you can't imagine

515
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:48,640
anything that's more arrogant than not

516
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:50,830
because really do you really think that

517
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:52,840
you can twist the structure of a reality

518
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:54,669
and that that's going to work out for

519
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:56,919
you without it snapping back it's so

520
00:20:54,669 --> 00:20:59,020
obvious that that can't work that that

521
00:20:56,919 --> 00:21:02,470
everyone knows it but anyways back to

522
00:20:59,020 --> 00:21:04,929
the initial point is that you know by

523
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:07,000
the rules of the game that you yourself

524
00:21:04,929 --> 00:21:09,580
are playing that some of the times

525
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:12,610
you're violating the rules of the game

526
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:15,790
that you're playing and the first issue

527
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:18,100
with regards to say stating the truth or

528
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:21,490
behaving in a responsible manner would

529
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:23,580
be merely stopped cheating at whatever

530
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:26,020
game it is that you've chosen to play

531
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:27,730
that's a good start and that'll

532
00:21:26,020 --> 00:21:29,110
straighten that will straighten out your

533
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:33,480
life it'll start in the straight and

534
00:21:29,110 --> 00:21:36,040
start to straighten out your life and so

535
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:38,140
well the flood what the hell does the

536
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:39,520
flood tie into this well you know we

537
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:41,140
live in a corrupt structure we're

538
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:42,700
corrupt as individuals we live in a

539
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:44,559
corrupt structure and part of that

540
00:21:42,700 --> 00:21:45,970
corruption has just happenstance it's

541
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:48,190
the way things fall apart but the other

542
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:50,490
part of it is that not only are we not

543
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:53,440
aiming up we're actually aiming down and

544
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:55,299
the flood story is a warning and it's a

545
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:59,230
very clear warning and the warning is if

546
00:21:55,299 --> 00:22:02,400
you aim down enough and then if enough

547
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:04,419
of you aim down at the same time

548
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:07,900
everything will degenerate into

549
00:22:04,419 --> 00:22:10,419
something that's indistinguishable from

550
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:11,919
the chaos from which things emerged at

551
00:22:10,419 --> 00:22:13,390
the beginning of time it's something

552
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:15,130
like that because the

553
00:22:13,390 --> 00:22:17,920
the cosmos that's presented in

554
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:19,840
mythological representations is chaos

555
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:21,250
versus order right the order is on top

556
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:23,170
you might say and the chaos is always

557
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:24,760
underneath and the chaos can break

558
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:26,170
through or the order can crumble and you

559
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:28,750
can fall into the chaos and that chaos

560
00:22:26,170 --> 00:22:32,380
is intermingle intermingled potential

561
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:34,990
and the way that you destroy the order

562
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:36,400
and let the chaos rise back up which is

563
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:40,809
exactly how its portrayed in the flood

564
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:42,280
story is by well by inhabiting the

565
00:22:40,809 --> 00:22:44,590
corpse of your father that's one

566
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:47,290
mythological motif and feeding on the

567
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:50,110
remains and with no gratitude and no

568
00:22:47,290 --> 00:22:53,559
attempt to replenish what it is that

569
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:56,650
you're taking from and the warning in

570
00:22:53,559 --> 00:22:58,150
the flood story is don't do that for

571
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:59,860
very long because things will happen

572
00:22:58,150 --> 00:23:02,080
that are so awful you cannot possibly

573
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:03,250
imagine it and that will happen to you

574
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,330
personally and it'll happen to your

575
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:05,620
family and it will happen to your

576
00:23:04,330 --> 00:23:07,270
community and it's happened to people

577
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:09,250
over and over throughout history and

578
00:23:07,270 --> 00:23:11,169
it's quite interesting you know it's

579
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:14,230
very soon after the story of Cain and

580
00:23:11,169 --> 00:23:15,640
Abel when you see evil enter the world

581
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:18,070
in the story of Adam and Eve

582
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:20,260
along with self-consciousness and evil

583
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:21,490
there is the ability that's the

584
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:23,410
knowledge of good and evil that's the

585
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:25,179
ability to hurt other people

586
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:27,429
self-consciously to know what you're

587
00:23:25,179 --> 00:23:29,080
doing and then of course instantly Cain

588
00:23:27,429 --> 00:23:31,660
takes that to the absolute extreme and

589
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:34,570
he uses that capacity to to destroy

590
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:37,540
really what he loves best he gets as

591
00:23:34,570 --> 00:23:39,309
close as a human being can to destroying

592
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:41,140
the divine ideal because of course his

593
00:23:39,309 --> 00:23:43,750
brother is able and Abel is favored by

594
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:45,549
God and Cain destroys them which Cain

595
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:47,590
tells God at the end of that episode

596
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:49,090
that his punishment is more than he can

597
00:23:47,590 --> 00:23:51,669
bear and I think the reason for that is

598
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:55,150
where are you once you destroy your own

599
00:23:51,669 --> 00:23:58,390
ideal what's left for you there's

600
00:23:55,150 --> 00:24:00,429
nowhere to go there's no up and when

601
00:23:58,390 --> 00:24:02,440
there's no up there's a lot of down and

602
00:24:00,429 --> 00:24:05,230
you know there's an idea that was put

603
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:07,960
forth very nicely in Milton's Paradise

604
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:10,090
Lost when he was describing from a

605
00:24:07,960 --> 00:24:14,650
psychological perspective essentially

606
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:16,240
what hell is and hell is you're in hell

607
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:18,580
to the degree that you're distant from

608
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:20,860
the good that that might be a good way

609
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:22,690
of thinking about it and if you destroy

610
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:24,760
your own ideal which you do with

611
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:27,010
jealousy and resentment and and the

612
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:29,680
desire to pull down people who you would

613
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:31,480
like to be let's say then you end up in

614
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:33,700
a situation that's indistinguishable

615
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:36,040
from hell and the way the story the

616
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:39,700
biblical story unfolds as well it's it's

617
00:24:36,040 --> 00:24:41,830
it's Cain and then it's the flood and so

618
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:44,110
Cain adopts this mode of being that's

619
00:24:41,830 --> 00:24:45,460
antithetical to being itself at least a

620
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:47,710
positive being itself he does it

621
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:50,560
voluntarily does it knowing full well

622
00:24:47,710 --> 00:24:52,450
what he's doing and the net consequence

623
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:55,150
of this that as it ripples through the

624
00:24:52,450 --> 00:24:57,070
entire social structure is that God

625
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:58,510
stands back and says this whole thing is

626
00:24:57,070 --> 00:25:01,360
God so bad the only thing we can do is

627
00:24:58,510 --> 00:25:03,370
is wipe it to the ground and that is

628
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:06,010
that is no joke

629
00:25:03,370 --> 00:25:07,060
that's exactly how things work and one

630
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:08,890
of the things that's extraordinarily

631
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:10,990
terrifying about that sequence of

632
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:13,900
stories and I believe this to be true I

633
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:16,210
think I realized this independently of

634
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:18,280
any of the analysis that I was doing of

635
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:20,050
mythological stories because I looked at

636
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:22,180
what happened in places like the Soviet

637
00:25:20,050 --> 00:25:24,480
Union and Mao's China and in Nazi

638
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:27,010
Germany and the most penetrating

639
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,290
observers of those societies the people

640
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:31,780
who were most interested in how it was

641
00:25:29,290 --> 00:25:35,410
that those absolute catastrophes came

642
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:36,940
about all said the same thing it was

643
00:25:35,410 --> 00:25:39,370
rooted in the degeneration of the

644
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:40,780
individuals who made up the society you

645
00:25:39,370 --> 00:25:42,400
know you hear what people will thought

646
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:44,410
were following orders it's like no that

647
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:46,600
that explanation doesn't hold water or

648
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:47,890
that you'd be punished if you resisted

649
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,210
well there is some truth in that but

650
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:50,800
nowhere near as much as people might

651
00:25:49,210 --> 00:25:53,080
think especially at the beginnings of

652
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:55,360
the process more it was that people

653
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:57,490
decided each and every one of them to

654
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:59,740
turn a blind eye to the catastrophes and

655
00:25:57,490 --> 00:26:01,330
to participate in the lies and that

656
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:03,880
warped the entire societies and they

657
00:26:01,330 --> 00:26:05,980
went as you know they they feared their

658
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:08,230
way downward to something as closely

659
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:10,150
approximating hell as you could hope to

660
00:26:08,230 --> 00:26:11,860
manage especially in places like Nazi

661
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:14,350
Germany and well in all three of those

662
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:16,600
places and in Mao is China and in the

663
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:18,310
Soviet Union and so the thing that's so

664
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,810
frightening about one of the things

665
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:21,940
that's so frightening about the stories

666
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:24,910
in Genesis is they say something very

667
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:27,280
clear which is that your moral

668
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:30,570
degeneration contributes in no small way

669
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:34,510
to the degeneration of the entire cosmos

670
00:26:30,570 --> 00:26:35,020
you say well I would like my life to be

671
00:26:34,510 --> 00:26:37,720
meaningful

672
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:39,220
people say that really would you really

673
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:40,990
you really would like your life to be

674
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:42,520
meaningful you think maybe people would

675
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:44,350
made a little nihilism to not have to

676
00:26:42,520 --> 00:26:46,300
face that particular realization and I

677
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:50,500
think people do that all the time it's a

678
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:54,100
terrible way to to to realize but we are

679
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:56,410
networked together in that that's the

680
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:58,240
price of or let's say that's the

681
00:26:56,410 --> 00:27:01,330
vulnerability that's associated with our

682
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:05,050
intense capacity to communicate and it

683
00:27:01,330 --> 00:27:07,059
is certainly possible that the ripples

684
00:27:05,050 --> 00:27:10,120
of our individual actions have

685
00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:12,250
consequences that are far beyond the

686
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:14,170
limits of our immediate consciousness

687
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:16,660
and I also think people know that too

688
00:27:14,170 --> 00:27:18,670
they know that in the way that people

689
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:21,190
know things when they don't want to know

690
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:22,929
them which means they know them embodied

691
00:27:21,190 --> 00:27:24,490
they can feel them they can sense them

692
00:27:22,929 --> 00:27:25,990
they have an emotional response to them

693
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:27,520
but there's no damn way they're going to

694
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:29,800
let them become articulate because they

695
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:31,390
don't want to know and when you're

696
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:33,130
feeling guilty and ashamed about the

697
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:34,750
things you've done or not done and I

698
00:27:33,130 --> 00:27:37,090
know that can get out of hand as well

699
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:39,040
it's often because there is a crooked

700
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:41,830
little part of you that's aiming at the

701
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:43,720
worst possible outcome you know one of

702
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:45,700
the things you said about the shadow you

703
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:47,620
know that young famous idea that

704
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:49,360
everyone has a dark side and that that

705
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:53,620
dark side needs to be incorporated and

706
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:54,490
made conscious young said the shadow of

707
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:56,860
the human being

708
00:27:54,490 --> 00:27:58,809
reaches all the way to hell and he

709
00:27:56,860 --> 00:28:00,220
actually that's the thing that's so

710
00:27:58,809 --> 00:28:02,140
interesting about interesting about

711
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:04,570
reading Carl Jung is he actually means

712
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:07,720
what he says it's not a metaphor it's

713
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:11,140
like the part of you that's twisted

714
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:13,840
against being is aligned with the part

715
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:15,910
of the cosmos let's say the conscious

716
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,470
cosmos that's aiming at making

717
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:20,170
everything as terrible as it can

718
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:22,120
possibly be and you know it's a terrible

719
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:23,710
shock to realize that it's partly why

720
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:25,960
people don't realize that it's it's

721
00:28:23,710 --> 00:28:28,420
something that people keep at an arm's

722
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:30,340
length it's it's the same as recognizing

723
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:31,960
yourself as a Nazi concentration camp

724
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:34,300
camp guard which is a very useful

725
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:36,970
exercise because there's absolutely no

726
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:40,570
reason why you couldn't have been or

727
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:43,300
still could be one so and if you think

728
00:28:40,570 --> 00:28:45,100
otherwise then all the more reason for

729
00:28:43,300 --> 00:28:47,320
assuming that you would be unable to

730
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:48,940
resist the temptation if it was in fact

731
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:52,090
offered to you and if you don't think

732
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:53,679
it's a temptation then the then there's

733
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:54,460
so much that you don't know about human

734
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:56,379
beings that

735
00:28:54,460 --> 00:28:57,999
you're not even in the game because if

736
00:28:56,379 --> 00:28:59,499
it wasn't a temptation then people

737
00:28:57,999 --> 00:29:01,480
bloody well wouldn't have done it and

738
00:28:59,499 --> 00:29:09,190
plenty of people did it and it's no

739
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:12,249
wonder so so things get serious in

740
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:15,009
Genesis very very rapidly and and the

741
00:29:12,249 --> 00:29:17,710
depth of the seriousness is ultimate

742
00:29:15,009 --> 00:29:25,059
archetypal that's it gets as serious as

743
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:28,450
it can get the story of Noah and the

744
00:29:25,059 --> 00:29:30,730
flood opens in a fragmentary manner and

745
00:29:28,450 --> 00:29:33,820
I believe that these passages are part

746
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:35,619
of a longer story that we only have bits

747
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:40,990
and pieces of and an also one that's

748
00:29:35,619 --> 00:29:43,570
fragmented in its in its it its parts of

749
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:45,549
more than one story and it starts like

750
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:47,019
this it came to pass when men began to

751
00:29:45,549 --> 00:29:49,059
multiply on the face of the earth and

752
00:29:47,019 --> 00:29:51,549
and and daughters were born unto them

753
00:29:49,059 --> 00:29:54,369
that the sons of God saw the daughters

754
00:29:51,549 --> 00:29:56,980
of men that they were fair and they took

755
00:29:54,369 --> 00:29:59,710
them wives of all which they chose now

756
00:29:56,980 --> 00:30:03,519
there's an idea there there's two ways

757
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:05,320
of looking at the past and you can kind

758
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:07,570
of see that in the political landscape

759
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:09,460
that we inhabit now on the more

760
00:30:07,570 --> 00:30:11,529
conservative end of the spectrum people

761
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:14,049
regard the past as the land of giants

762
00:30:11,529 --> 00:30:15,940
right there were the heroes of the past

763
00:30:14,049 --> 00:30:18,369
who established the current conditions

764
00:30:15,940 --> 00:30:22,029
that we exist in and then the people on

765
00:30:18,369 --> 00:30:23,950
the left are more concerned perhaps with

766
00:30:22,029 --> 00:30:25,779
the what would you call it with a

767
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:27,309
lineage of corruption that's come down

768
00:30:25,779 --> 00:30:29,679
through the centuries and both of those

769
00:30:27,309 --> 00:30:32,619
perspectives are accurate you can say

770
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:34,629
well there were there there were the

771
00:30:32,619 --> 00:30:36,159
great heroes of the past who established

772
00:30:34,629 --> 00:30:37,929
our modes of being you can think of them

773
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:39,549
as composite beings if you want that's

774
00:30:37,929 --> 00:30:41,649
fine that's a perfectly reasonable way

775
00:30:39,549 --> 00:30:44,350
of thinking about it and you can also

776
00:30:41,649 --> 00:30:45,820
think of the of the accumulation of

777
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:48,009
corruption and evil that's come along

778
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:49,749
the centuries as well and so you see

779
00:30:48,009 --> 00:30:52,570
both of those reflected in these initial

780
00:30:49,749 --> 00:30:54,249
few lines that the sons of gods so those

781
00:30:52,570 --> 00:30:55,509
are the hero's saw the daughters of men

782
00:30:54,249 --> 00:30:59,320
that they were fair and they took them

783
00:30:55,509 --> 00:31:04,429
wives of all of which they chose then

784
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:06,259
this statement comes in

785
00:31:04,429 --> 00:31:07,730
and somewhat of a non sequitur and the

786
00:31:06,259 --> 00:31:09,679
Lord said my spirit shall not always

787
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:11,929
strive with man for that he is also

788
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:14,299
flesh yet his days shall be a hundred

789
00:31:11,929 --> 00:31:16,279
and twenty years and I looked at a

790
00:31:14,299 --> 00:31:17,990
variety of interpretations of that line

791
00:31:16,279 --> 00:31:19,820
because it doesn't seem to follow so

792
00:31:17,990 --> 00:31:22,629
clearly from the previous line and

793
00:31:19,820 --> 00:31:26,240
exactly what it means isn't obvious but

794
00:31:22,629 --> 00:31:29,869
it seems to be the first line talks

795
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:32,179
about the heroes of the past and and the

796
00:31:29,869 --> 00:31:33,919
second line says wait a second there's

797
00:31:32,179 --> 00:31:36,559
something corrupt about the human mode

798
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:39,460
of being and one of the consequences of

799
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:42,289
that as far as God is concerned is that

800
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:45,559
there are conditions under which the

801
00:31:42,289 --> 00:31:48,200
divine Spirit will not strive with man

802
00:31:45,559 --> 00:31:52,429
what that means is there are conditions

803
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:54,379
under which let's say the I don't think

804
00:31:52,429 --> 00:31:56,389
there's any other way of putting it is

805
00:31:54,379 --> 00:31:58,669
the divine impulse towards the good will

806
00:31:56,389 --> 00:32:01,460
abandon you because of things that

807
00:31:58,669 --> 00:32:04,129
you've done and then the secondary

808
00:32:01,460 --> 00:32:06,259
consideration here is that perhaps

809
00:32:04,129 --> 00:32:08,179
because of the degeneration of people

810
00:32:06,259 --> 00:32:11,330
it's not so obvious here that our life

811
00:32:08,179 --> 00:32:13,159
spans are limited that the spirit that

812
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:15,049
inhabits us will only do so for a

813
00:32:13,159 --> 00:32:17,269
limited amount of time and that's

814
00:32:15,049 --> 00:32:19,580
tangled in a strange way in with the

815
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:21,919
idea of human moral culpability and

816
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:24,169
that's posed against the notion of the

817
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:26,119
Giants of the past and then it returns

818
00:32:24,169 --> 00:32:28,519
to the giant idea the narrative returns

819
00:32:26,119 --> 00:32:30,740
to the giant idea and reads there were

820
00:32:28,519 --> 00:32:32,450
giants in the earth in those days and

821
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:34,039
also after that when the sons of men

822
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:36,200
came in unto the daughters of men and

823
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:38,090
they bare children to them and the same

824
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:42,259
became mighty men which were of old men

825
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:45,669
of renown and that's the end of that

826
00:32:42,259 --> 00:32:49,309
sequence of fragments it's it's very

827
00:32:45,669 --> 00:32:52,340
broken but you can see a dual narrative

828
00:32:49,309 --> 00:32:55,700
underneath it and and one of the

829
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:58,669
narratives is that there's the kind of

830
00:32:55,700 --> 00:33:00,799
corruption despite the joy the nature of

831
00:32:58,669 --> 00:33:04,519
the Giants of the past there's the kind

832
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:07,940
of corruption lurking that would cause

833
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:11,419
God to with hold his grace and allow men

834
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:15,259
to deteriorate and and that sets the

835
00:33:11,419 --> 00:33:16,730
stage for Noah and the flood and God saw

836
00:33:15,259 --> 00:33:18,080
that the wickedness of man was great in

837
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:19,429
the earth and that the

838
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:21,070
and that every imagination of the

839
00:33:19,429 --> 00:33:27,110
thoughts of his heart was only evil

840
00:33:21,070 --> 00:33:28,429
continually you know one of the things I

841
00:33:27,110 --> 00:33:30,529
really didn't like about going to church

842
00:33:28,429 --> 00:33:32,090
when I was a kid I went to a pretty

843
00:33:30,529 --> 00:33:33,890
moderate church it was the United Church

844
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:39,260
which has hardly even become a church

845
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:40,220
now it's so moderate so to speak one of

846
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:44,289
the things I didn't like was the

847
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:47,539
constant harping by the Ministry on the

848
00:33:44,289 --> 00:33:49,669
sinful nature of human beings like it

849
00:33:47,539 --> 00:33:50,840
didn't speak to me properly partly

850
00:33:49,669 --> 00:33:55,269
because I really didn't understand what

851
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:59,799
it meant and partly because it seemed

852
00:33:55,269 --> 00:34:02,779
well sort of what would you say was

853
00:33:59,799 --> 00:34:04,399
self-flagellating in an unattractive way

854
00:34:02,779 --> 00:34:06,529
I don't know if there is an attractive

855
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:09,080
way to be self-flagellating but it was

856
00:34:06,529 --> 00:34:12,290
it was and there was something about it

857
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:14,899
there was also wrote and and faked that

858
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:16,849
I didn't like but you know in later

859
00:34:14,899 --> 00:34:18,800
years I thought about that more and I

860
00:34:16,849 --> 00:34:21,980
started to understand that there was

861
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:26,599
some real utility in asking people to

862
00:34:21,980 --> 00:34:28,849
keep the evil that they're doing clear

863
00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:31,129
and conscious in the forefront of their

864
00:34:28,849 --> 00:34:34,070
imagination I think I mentioned to you

865
00:34:31,129 --> 00:34:37,190
guys last week this little episode from

866
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:39,290
what we know of Mesopotamian culture

867
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:41,270
surrounding the emperor the new year's

868
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:43,879
festival they would take the emperor

869
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:47,750
outside of the walled city and strip him

870
00:34:43,879 --> 00:34:50,839
of his garb so that he was reduced to

871
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:53,270
just an ordinary man and then humiliate

872
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:56,230
him richly and then ask him how it was

873
00:34:53,270 --> 00:34:59,000
over the last year that he wasn't a

874
00:34:56,230 --> 00:35:00,890
spectacular embodiment of Marduk and

875
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:03,050
Marduk was the Mesopotamian deity who

876
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:04,430
made order out of chaos essentially and

877
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:07,099
the emperor was supposed to sit and

878
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:08,420
think okay well you know I'm Emperor and

879
00:35:07,099 --> 00:35:10,250
everything I should be doing a good job

880
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:12,920
maybe I should even be doing a great job

881
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:14,359
and probably I'm coming up short in a

882
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:15,770
bunch of ways and that actually happens

883
00:35:14,359 --> 00:35:18,220
to be important since I'm running the

884
00:35:15,770 --> 00:35:22,280
entire show I should be very very

885
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:24,740
cognizant of how I'm failing to live up

886
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:27,020
to the ideal and that is what that call

887
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:29,359
that constant clarion call that's

888
00:35:27,020 --> 00:35:31,160
degenerated I would say an institutional

889
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:31,700
Christianity that was actually the idea

890
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,319
was

891
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:36,109
look there's a bunch of ways that you're

892
00:35:33,319 --> 00:35:38,510
not being everything you could be and it

893
00:35:36,109 --> 00:35:40,400
is not supposed to be a whip to knock

894
00:35:38,510 --> 00:35:42,619
you down although maybe it's a whip to

895
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,119
knock down your pride the pride that

896
00:35:42,619 --> 00:35:46,970
stops you from being aware of your

897
00:35:44,119 --> 00:35:49,130
insufficiencies it's more like a call to

898
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:50,750
the opposite it's like well you should

899
00:35:49,130 --> 00:35:52,849
stop doing those things because you

900
00:35:50,750 --> 00:35:54,559
could be so much more than you are and

901
00:35:52,849 --> 00:35:56,329
that would be so much better for you and

902
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:58,460
everyone else that it's just it's just

903
00:35:56,329 --> 00:36:00,470
not good that you continue doing these

904
00:35:58,460 --> 00:36:04,339
things continue breaking your own rules

905
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:05,809
let's say because we could certainly as

906
00:36:04,339 --> 00:36:07,069
I said we can start this game by

907
00:36:05,809 --> 00:36:08,510
assuming that you should at least play

908
00:36:07,069 --> 00:36:11,960
the game that you're playing straight

909
00:36:08,510 --> 00:36:15,589
and so and it is the case that if you

910
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:18,049
watch yourself it's a terrifying thing

911
00:36:15,589 --> 00:36:21,290
to do but if you watch yourself you'll

912
00:36:18,049 --> 00:36:24,079
see you lie a lot like when I learned

913
00:36:21,290 --> 00:36:26,390
this to begin with I was in my 20s and I

914
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:29,390
was I'm a smart person and I was very

915
00:36:26,390 --> 00:36:32,359
proud of that because I was also a small

916
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:35,960
person I was moved ahead one year in

917
00:36:32,359 --> 00:36:37,940
school and I was a small person to begin

918
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:40,910
with and so I was a very small person in

919
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:42,799
my classes and also very mouthy which

920
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:45,470
might not come as much of a surprise and

921
00:36:42,799 --> 00:36:47,630
somewhat provocative and so you know and

922
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:49,010
I got pushed around a fair bit because P

923
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:50,480
everybody gets pushed around and my

924
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:52,040
weapon was to be mouthy and it was a

925
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:54,049
fairly effective weapon although it

926
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:56,359
tended to backfire because you know if

927
00:36:54,049 --> 00:36:59,089
you're really effectively mouthy with

928
00:36:56,359 --> 00:37:00,920
large obnoxious people then they tend to

929
00:36:59,089 --> 00:37:03,140
respond in a relatively negative

930
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:05,809
physical way and so that sort of thing

931
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:07,970
was happening to me a fair bit and but I

932
00:37:05,809 --> 00:37:11,599
was quite I was quite proud of the fact

933
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:17,089
that I was that I I was I had some

934
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:19,520
intellectual power and that it was then

935
00:37:17,089 --> 00:37:21,950
in my 20s when I learned about some of

936
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:24,170
the danger of that because I started to

937
00:37:21,950 --> 00:37:27,920
read partly Milton's Paradise Lost and I

938
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:29,660
started to understand the the danger of

939
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:31,010
the intellect and the danger of the

940
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:33,349
intellect as far as I can tell is that

941
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:35,180
it tends towards pride and arrogance and

942
00:37:33,349 --> 00:37:37,010
it also tends to fall in love with its

943
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:39,980
own productions and so that's actually

944
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:41,809
Lucifer in Paradise Lost absolu suffer

945
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:43,579
Lucifer is the intellect that falls in

946
00:37:41,809 --> 00:37:44,750
love with its own productions and then

947
00:37:43,579 --> 00:37:47,360
assumes that there's not

948
00:37:44,750 --> 00:37:49,460
outside of what it thinks that's the

949
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:51,470
totalitarian mentality right it's like

950
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:53,360
we have a total system and we know how

951
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:54,860
everything works and we're going to

952
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:56,480
implement it and that'll bring about

953
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:59,360
heaven on earth right that's that's a

954
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:01,970
that that's the totalitarian mindset and

955
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:06,740
that's associated with intellectual

956
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:08,870
arrogance and another at the same time

957
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:10,970
another thing what was happening to me

958
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:13,610
so I was noticing that I started to

959
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:14,870
understand what that meant and I also

960
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:17,240
started to understand that there was

961
00:38:14,870 --> 00:38:19,850
more to life than the intellect much

962
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:21,620
more if I smoke too much and I drank too

963
00:38:19,850 --> 00:38:23,780
much and I weighed like 130 pounds I

964
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:25,790
wasn't in good physical shape and like I

965
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:27,140
had a lot of things to do when I went to

966
00:38:25,790 --> 00:38:28,910
graduate school to put myself together

967
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:31,160
and at the same time I was trying to

968
00:38:28,910 --> 00:38:33,650
understand why things had gone so

969
00:38:31,160 --> 00:38:35,750
crazily wrong with the world its

970
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:37,520
encapsulation in the Cold War and what

971
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:39,380
role I might be playing in that if any

972
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:46,520
or what role any of us were playing in

973
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:49,340
that at the same time I was working out

974
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:53,810
of prison only a little bit I worked

975
00:38:49,340 --> 00:38:55,870
with this crazy psychologist he he is to

976
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:58,640
put jokes on his multiple-choice tests

977
00:38:55,870 --> 00:39:01,130
he was a really eccentric guy but I

978
00:38:58,640 --> 00:39:03,050
really liked his courses he and he

979
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:05,300
taught a course on creativity and he was

980
00:39:03,050 --> 00:39:07,160
also a prison psychologist and he was an

981
00:39:05,300 --> 00:39:08,510
eccentric guy and he for some reason

982
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:10,790
like me and maybe because I was

983
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:11,990
eccentric too and he invited me to go

984
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:13,700
out to the Edmonton maximum-security

985
00:39:11,990 --> 00:39:15,530
prison with him a couple of times which

986
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:17,090
I did and that was a very interesting

987
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:23,480
experience because I was trying to

988
00:39:17,090 --> 00:39:26,660
figure out what role each individual's

989
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:29,870
behavior bore to the pathology of the

990
00:39:26,660 --> 00:39:33,740
group was something like that and I went

991
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:35,360
out there and I met a little guy smaller

992
00:39:33,740 --> 00:39:38,650
than me I was a little bigger by then

993
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:41,060
and he was a pretty innocuous guy and

994
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:43,580
what had happened was I was out in this

995
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:45,200
gymnasium it looks like a high school

996
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:47,900
the prison which is really quite telling

997
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:49,310
in my estimation but and there were all

998
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:50,510
these like monsters in there

999
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:52,070
weightlifting and like they were

1000
00:39:50,510 --> 00:39:53,240
monsters I remember one guy who was

1001
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:54,890
tattooed everywhere and he had like a

1002
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:56,240
huge scar running down the middle of his

1003
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:57,280
chest it looked like someone had to hit

1004
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:59,650
him with an axe and

1005
00:39:57,280 --> 00:40:01,390
you know and and I was in there I had

1006
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:03,010
this weird cape that I used to wear that

1007
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:07,810
I bought in Portugal and some boots that

1008
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:10,120
went along with it and yeah I was like

1009
00:40:07,810 --> 00:40:11,500
an 1890s Sherlock Holmes cape and it was

1010
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:13,510
really like it was from the 1890s

1011
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:15,880
because this little village was up on a

1012
00:40:13,510 --> 00:40:17,290
hill it was a walled city on a hill and

1013
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:19,420
they sold these things and I don't think

1014
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:20,860
they changed the style since 1890 and so

1015
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:22,780
I thought they were really cool and so I

1016
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:29,830
was wearing that which wasn't perhaps

1017
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:31,120
the most conservative garb to dawn if

1018
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:32,710
you're going to wear if you're going to

1019
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:35,380
go to a maximum-security prison so

1020
00:40:32,710 --> 00:40:38,470
anyways I was in the gymnasium and the

1021
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:40,510
car the psychologist left and god only

1022
00:40:38,470 --> 00:40:42,820
knows I mean that's what he was like and

1023
00:40:40,510 --> 00:40:44,770
all these guys came or all these guys

1024
00:40:42,820 --> 00:40:46,960
came around me you know and they were

1025
00:40:44,770 --> 00:40:52,000
offering to trade their prison clothes

1026
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:53,470
for my tape and was it was like I was

1027
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:55,630
being made an offer I couldn't refuse

1028
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:56,860
you know and so I didn't I didn't really

1029
00:40:55,630 --> 00:40:58,900
know what to do and then this little guy

1030
00:40:56,860 --> 00:41:01,210
said something like that the

1031
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:03,400
psychologist sent me to come and take

1032
00:41:01,210 --> 00:41:06,490
you away or something like that and so I

1033
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:09,280
thought well better this little guy

1034
00:41:06,490 --> 00:41:13,030
banned all these monsters so we went

1035
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:14,890
outside the gym through some doors like

1036
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:17,560
school doors went outside the gym into

1037
00:41:14,890 --> 00:41:18,970
the exercise yard I guess and we were

1038
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:19,960
wandering along and he was talking to me

1039
00:41:18,970 --> 00:41:22,180
and he seemed like a kind of an

1040
00:41:19,960 --> 00:41:23,620
innocuous guy and then the psychologist

1041
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:26,260
showed up at the door and motioned us

1042
00:41:23,620 --> 00:41:28,840
back and so which was kind of a relief

1043
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:30,160
and so I went into his office and he

1044
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:31,750
said you know that guy that you walked

1045
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:35,890
out in the yard with and I said yeah he

1046
00:41:31,750 --> 00:41:37,390
said he he took two cops one night and

1047
00:41:35,890 --> 00:41:39,190
he had them kneel down and while they

1048
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:41,500
were begging for their lives he shot

1049
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:43,650
them both in the back of the head and I

1050
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:48,010
thought hmm

1051
00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:50,100
that's see the thing that was so

1052
00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:52,180
interesting was that he was so innocuous

1053
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:53,680
right because what you'd hope is that

1054
00:41:52,180 --> 00:41:56,680
someone like that would be very much

1055
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:58,450
unlike you let's say and certainly

1056
00:41:56,680 --> 00:42:00,280
wouldn't be like someone innocuous that

1057
00:41:58,450 --> 00:42:01,960
you'd met what you'd want is that the

1058
00:42:00,280 --> 00:42:03,850
guy would be like you know half were

1059
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:05,170
wolf and half vampire so you could just

1060
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:07,360
tell right away that he was a

1061
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:10,400
cold-blooded killer but no he was this

1062
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:12,079
sort of ineffectual little guy who

1063
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,940
was certainly not ineffectual if you

1064
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:17,480
gave him a revolver in the upper hand

1065
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:19,730
and so so that made me think that made

1066
00:42:17,480 --> 00:42:22,010
me think a lot about the relationship

1067
00:42:19,730 --> 00:42:23,539
between being innocuous and and being

1068
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:25,279
dangerous and then another thing

1069
00:42:23,539 --> 00:42:28,069
happened I met another guy out there and

1070
00:42:25,279 --> 00:42:30,529
then a week or two later I heard that he

1071
00:42:28,069 --> 00:42:34,130
and a friend of his had held another guy

1072
00:42:30,529 --> 00:42:37,880
down and pulverized his left leg with a

1073
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:39,200
lead pipe like just pulverized it and

1074
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:41,000
the reason for that was that they

1075
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:44,660
thought that he was a snitch and maybe

1076
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:46,460
he was and at that time I did something

1077
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:47,839
different instead of being shocked and

1078
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:51,170
horrified by that although I certainly

1079
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:52,490
was I thought how in the world could you

1080
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:54,920
do that because I didn't think I could

1081
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:56,480
do that I didn't think that I thought

1082
00:42:54,920 --> 00:43:00,140
that there was a qualitative distinction

1083
00:42:56,480 --> 00:43:02,450
between me and those people and so I

1084
00:43:00,140 --> 00:43:05,779
spent about two weeks trying to see if I

1085
00:43:02,450 --> 00:43:07,609
could figure out under what conditions I

1086
00:43:05,779 --> 00:43:09,380
could do that like what kind of

1087
00:43:07,609 --> 00:43:11,210
psychological transformation I would

1088
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:13,579
have to undergo to be able to do that

1089
00:43:11,210 --> 00:43:15,799
and so that was a meditative exercise

1090
00:43:13,579 --> 00:43:18,529
let's say and it only took about ten

1091
00:43:15,799 --> 00:43:20,089
days for me to realize that not only

1092
00:43:18,529 --> 00:43:21,380
could I do that it would be a hell of a

1093
00:43:20,089 --> 00:43:23,240
lot easier than I thought it would be

1094
00:43:21,380 --> 00:43:25,039
and that's sort of where that wall

1095
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:27,200
between me and what being described as

1096
00:43:25,039 --> 00:43:30,079
the shadow started to fall apart and

1097
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:32,480
that also was very useful because I

1098
00:43:30,079 --> 00:43:34,400
started to wreck I started to treat

1099
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:36,049
myself as somewhat different entity

1100
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:37,579
because I hadn't been aware up to that

1101
00:43:36,049 --> 00:43:39,770
point you know because I thought I was a

1102
00:43:37,579 --> 00:43:41,630
good guy and there's no reason for me to

1103
00:43:39,770 --> 00:43:42,770
think that because you're not a good guy

1104
00:43:41,630 --> 00:43:44,000
unless you've really made a bloody

1105
00:43:42,770 --> 00:43:46,490
effort to be a good guy

1106
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:48,890
you're just not it's not easy and so

1107
00:43:46,490 --> 00:43:51,109
you're probably a moderately bad guy and

1108
00:43:48,890 --> 00:43:53,690
that's a long ways from being an

1109
00:43:51,109 --> 00:43:55,549
absolutely horrible guy but it's also a

1110
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:57,200
long ways from being a good guy and so

1111
00:43:55,549 --> 00:43:58,880
but I had a little more respect for

1112
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:02,150
myself after that because I also

1113
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:05,390
understood that there was a monstrous

1114
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:08,779
element to the human psyche that that

1115
00:44:05,390 --> 00:44:10,579
you needed to respect and that was part

1116
00:44:08,779 --> 00:44:12,500
of you that you should regard yourself

1117
00:44:10,579 --> 00:44:14,569
in some sense as a loaded weapon it's

1118
00:44:12,500 --> 00:44:16,069
very useful around children to regard

1119
00:44:14,569 --> 00:44:17,510
yourself as a loaded weapon because

1120
00:44:16,069 --> 00:44:20,869
around children you are a loaded weapon

1121
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:22,309
and the terrible experiences that many

1122
00:44:20,869 --> 00:44:24,940
children have with their parents are

1123
00:44:22,309 --> 00:44:24,940
testament to that

1124
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:31,750
anyways about the same time and and I

1125
00:44:30,190 --> 00:44:34,450
don't exactly know how these things were

1126
00:44:31,750 --> 00:44:38,290
causally related I guess it was because

1127
00:44:34,450 --> 00:44:40,360
I was trying to figure out who I was and

1128
00:44:38,290 --> 00:44:42,490
how that could be fixed something like

1129
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:46,060
that I started to pay very careful

1130
00:44:42,490 --> 00:44:47,590
attention to what I was saying I don't

1131
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:49,330
know if that happened voluntarily or

1132
00:44:47,590 --> 00:44:51,880
involuntarily but I could feel a sort of

1133
00:44:49,330 --> 00:44:53,290
split developing in my psyche and the

1134
00:44:51,880 --> 00:44:54,910
split and I've actually had students

1135
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:57,880
tell me the same thing that has happened

1136
00:44:54,910 --> 00:44:59,740
to them after they've listened to some

1137
00:44:57,880 --> 00:45:03,580
of the material that that I've been

1138
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:07,960
describing to all of you but it's split

1139
00:45:03,580 --> 00:45:10,870
into two let's say and one part was the

1140
00:45:07,960 --> 00:45:14,440
let's say the old me that was talking a

1141
00:45:10,870 --> 00:45:16,750
lot and that liked to argue and that

1142
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:19,510
liked ideas and there was another part

1143
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:22,690
that was watching that part like just

1144
00:45:19,510 --> 00:45:25,180
with its eyes open and neutrally judging

1145
00:45:22,690 --> 00:45:27,310
and the part that was neutrally judging

1146
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:31,030
was watching the part that was talking

1147
00:45:27,310 --> 00:45:33,160
and going that isn't your idea you don't

1148
00:45:31,030 --> 00:45:35,230
really believe that you don't really

1149
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:38,050
know what you're talking about that

1150
00:45:35,230 --> 00:45:39,550
isn't true and I thought that's really

1151
00:45:38,050 --> 00:45:41,380
interesting so now and that was

1152
00:45:39,550 --> 00:45:42,970
happening to like 95% of what I was

1153
00:45:41,380 --> 00:45:44,470
saying and so then I didn't really know

1154
00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:47,110
what to do I thought okay this is

1155
00:45:44,470 --> 00:45:48,640
strange so maybe I've fragmented and

1156
00:45:47,110 --> 00:45:50,590
that's just not a good thing at all I

1157
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:52,390
mean it wasn't like I was hearing voices

1158
00:45:50,590 --> 00:45:56,680
or anything like that I mean it wasn't

1159
00:45:52,390 --> 00:45:59,620
like that it was it was well people have

1160
00:45:56,680 --> 00:46:01,930
multiple parts so then I had this weird

1161
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:04,840
conundrum is like well which of those

1162
00:46:01,930 --> 00:46:07,900
two things are me is it the part that's

1163
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:10,930
listening and saying no that's rubbish

1164
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:12,670
that's a lie that's you're doing that to

1165
00:46:10,930 --> 00:46:15,580
impress people you're just trying to win

1166
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:17,310
the argument you know without me or was

1167
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:20,590
the part that was going about my normal

1168
00:46:17,310 --> 00:46:22,330
verbal business me and I didn't know but

1169
00:46:20,590 --> 00:46:25,030
I decided I would go with the critic and

1170
00:46:22,330 --> 00:46:28,150
then what I'd tried to do what I learned

1171
00:46:25,030 --> 00:46:32,110
to do I think was to stop saying things

1172
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:33,520
that made me weak and now that I mean

1173
00:46:32,110 --> 00:46:36,700
I'm still trying to do that because I'm

1174
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:38,559
always feeling when I talk

1175
00:46:36,700 --> 00:46:41,049
whether or not the words that I'm saying

1176
00:46:38,559 --> 00:46:43,900
are either making me align or making me

1177
00:46:41,049 --> 00:46:46,059
come apart and I think the alignment I

1178
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:47,200
really do think the alignment is I think

1179
00:46:46,059 --> 00:46:48,640
alignment is the right way of

1180
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:51,609
conceptualizing it because I think if

1181
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:55,290
you say things that are as true as you

1182
00:46:51,609 --> 00:46:57,970
can say them let's say then they come up

1183
00:46:55,290 --> 00:46:59,470
they come out of the depths inside of

1184
00:46:57,970 --> 00:47:01,510
you because we don't know where thoughts

1185
00:46:59,470 --> 00:47:03,460
come from we don't know how far down

1186
00:47:01,510 --> 00:47:05,430
into your sub structure the thoughts

1187
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:07,630
emerge we don't know what processes of

1188
00:47:05,430 --> 00:47:09,730
physiological alignment are necessary

1189
00:47:07,630 --> 00:47:11,859
for you to speak from the core of your

1190
00:47:09,730 --> 00:47:13,210
being we don't understand any of that we

1191
00:47:11,859 --> 00:47:14,680
don't even conceptualize that but I

1192
00:47:13,210 --> 00:47:16,180
believe that you can feel that and I

1193
00:47:14,680 --> 00:47:17,440
learned some of that from reading Carl

1194
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:20,349
Rogers by the way who's a great

1195
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:22,540
clinician because he talked about mental

1196
00:47:20,349 --> 00:47:26,380
health in part as a coherence between

1197
00:47:22,540 --> 00:47:27,760
the spiritual or the or the abstract and

1198
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:30,460
the physical that the two things were

1199
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:32,619
aligned and and there's a lot of idea of

1200
00:47:30,460 --> 00:47:35,049
alignment in psychoanalytic and clinical

1201
00:47:32,619 --> 00:47:38,619
thinking but anyways I decided that I

1202
00:47:35,049 --> 00:47:40,569
would start practicing not saying things

1203
00:47:38,619 --> 00:47:42,549
that would make me weak and what

1204
00:47:40,569 --> 00:47:44,950
happened was that I had to stop saying

1205
00:47:42,549 --> 00:47:48,040
almost everything that I was saying I

1206
00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:50,260
would say 95% of it as a hell of a shark

1207
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:52,059
to wake up and I mean this was over a

1208
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:54,309
few months but the hell of a shark to

1209
00:47:52,059 --> 00:47:58,540
wake up and realize that you're mostly

1210
00:47:54,309 --> 00:47:59,770
dead would it's a shock you know and you

1211
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:01,690
might think well do you really want all

1212
00:47:59,770 --> 00:48:03,970
of that to burn off well there's nothing

1213
00:48:01,690 --> 00:48:09,069
left but a little ha sleight of you it's

1214
00:48:03,970 --> 00:48:10,540
like well if that 5% is solid then maybe

1215
00:48:09,069 --> 00:48:14,650
that's exactly what you want to have

1216
00:48:10,540 --> 00:48:16,540
happened also I told you that story is

1217
00:48:14,650 --> 00:48:17,980
an elaboration of this line and God saw

1218
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:20,559
that the wickedness of man was great in

1219
00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:21,940
the earth and that every imagination of

1220
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:22,809
the thoughts of his heart was only evil

1221
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:26,530
continually

1222
00:48:22,809 --> 00:48:29,589
to question worth asking just exactly

1223
00:48:26,530 --> 00:48:31,510
what are your motives well you know

1224
00:48:29,589 --> 00:48:33,549
maybe they're purer than mine were and

1225
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:35,589
it's certainly possible I don't think

1226
00:48:33,549 --> 00:48:37,839
that I'm naturally a particularly good

1227
00:48:35,589 --> 00:48:40,420
person I think I have to work at it very

1228
00:48:37,839 --> 00:48:44,410
very hard and I don't necessarily think

1229
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:46,450
that everyone is like that but some

1230
00:48:44,410 --> 00:48:49,109
people are worse than that

1231
00:48:46,450 --> 00:48:52,630
and everyone's like that to some degree

1232
00:48:49,109 --> 00:48:54,810
so it's worth thinking about just how

1233
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:56,650
much trouble are you trying to cause you

1234
00:48:54,810 --> 00:48:57,849
know and the other thing you might think

1235
00:48:56,650 --> 00:48:59,829
about is that if you're not doing

1236
00:48:57,849 --> 00:49:01,930
something important with your life by

1237
00:48:59,829 --> 00:49:03,160
your own definition because that's the

1238
00:49:01,930 --> 00:49:05,250
game that we're playing you get to

1239
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:07,839
define the terms at least initially

1240
00:49:05,250 --> 00:49:08,829
maybe you're prone to cause trouble just

1241
00:49:07,839 --> 00:49:11,650
because you don't have anything better

1242
00:49:08,829 --> 00:49:14,109
to do because at least its trouble is

1243
00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:15,339
more interesting than boring you know

1244
00:49:14,109 --> 00:49:16,990
that's something you learn if you read

1245
00:49:15,339 --> 00:49:19,180
Dostoyevsky does he ask you knew that

1246
00:49:16,990 --> 00:49:20,260
extraordinarily well and so if you're

1247
00:49:19,180 --> 00:49:21,880
not doing something if you're not

1248
00:49:20,260 --> 00:49:24,010
pushing yourself to the limits of your

1249
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:27,970
capacity then you have plenty of left

1250
00:49:24,010 --> 00:49:30,369
over what would you say willpower

1251
00:49:27,970 --> 00:49:34,300
energy and resources to devote to

1252
00:49:30,369 --> 00:49:36,310
causing interesting trouble and so also

1253
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:38,500
I would say this is also an archetypal

1254
00:49:36,310 --> 00:49:39,820
scenario God saw that the wickedness of

1255
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:41,680
man was great in the earth and that

1256
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:44,650
every imagination of the thoughts of his

1257
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:48,329
heart was only evil continually that's

1258
00:49:44,650 --> 00:49:50,109
something to meditate on and it's not

1259
00:49:48,329 --> 00:49:52,480
self-destructive because what it is is

1260
00:49:50,109 --> 00:49:53,920
an attempt to it's like the diagnosis of

1261
00:49:52,480 --> 00:49:56,530
an illness it's like if that does happen

1262
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:58,359
to be the case for you or to some degree

1263
00:49:56,530 --> 00:50:01,300
maybe it's only 10% of you or something

1264
00:49:58,359 --> 00:50:02,800
or maybe it's 90% well then coming to

1265
00:50:01,300 --> 00:50:05,530
terms of that is excellent because then

1266
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:08,530
maybe you can stop doing it and what

1267
00:50:05,530 --> 00:50:10,240
would be the downside to that you'd have

1268
00:50:08,530 --> 00:50:11,530
to give up your resentment obviously in

1269
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:13,210
your hatred and all of that and that's

1270
00:50:11,530 --> 00:50:15,490
really annoying because those emotions

1271
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:18,069
are very they're easy to engage in and

1272
00:50:15,490 --> 00:50:19,540
they're and they're engaging and they

1273
00:50:18,069 --> 00:50:22,210
have this feeling of self-righteousness

1274
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:25,329
with them and that goes along with them

1275
00:50:22,210 --> 00:50:27,460
but you're not doing this in order to

1276
00:50:25,329 --> 00:50:28,900
put yourself down you're doing this in

1277
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:30,910
order to separate the wheat from the

1278
00:50:28,900 --> 00:50:34,410
chaff and to leave everything that you

1279
00:50:30,910 --> 00:50:34,410
don't have to be behind

1280
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:43,020
and it repented the Lord that he had

1281
00:50:41,430 --> 00:50:45,180
made man on the earth and it grieved him

1282
00:50:43,020 --> 00:50:47,069
at his heart and the Lord said I will

1283
00:50:45,180 --> 00:50:49,619
destroy man whom I have created from the

1284
00:50:47,069 --> 00:50:50,790
face of the earth both man and beast and

1285
00:50:49,619 --> 00:50:53,010
the creeping thing and the fowls of the

1286
00:50:50,790 --> 00:50:53,480
air for it repentance me that I've made

1287
00:50:53,010 --> 00:50:56,040
them

1288
00:50:53,480 --> 00:50:58,680
what's the idea well the idea is that

1289
00:50:56,040 --> 00:51:01,170
the cosmos that God created had become

1290
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:03,180
corrupt and that's a funny thing because

1291
00:51:01,170 --> 00:51:05,270
you know this is the other thing about

1292
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:08,369
Genesis that always hits me is that

1293
00:51:05,270 --> 00:51:09,960
that's also true I told you that the

1294
00:51:08,369 --> 00:51:12,599
Mesopotamians believe that human beings

1295
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:15,030
were made out of the blood of King knew

1296
00:51:12,599 --> 00:51:17,700
who was the worst monster monster that

1297
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:20,069
the dragon of chaos could imagine that's

1298
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:21,990
a pretty harsh diagnosis but but the

1299
00:51:20,069 --> 00:51:24,240
reason the Mesopotamians believe that is

1300
00:51:21,990 --> 00:51:27,119
because they knew as did the authors of

1301
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:30,839
genesis that human beings are the only

1302
00:51:27,119 --> 00:51:33,150
creatures in the cosmos let's say the

1303
00:51:30,839 --> 00:51:36,000
cosmos of being who are actually capable

1304
00:51:33,150 --> 00:51:39,480
of deceit conscious deceit and

1305
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:41,490
malevolence and the question is to what

1306
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:44,250
degree does the expression of that

1307
00:51:41,490 --> 00:51:46,680
conscious deceit and malevolence corrupt

1308
00:51:44,250 --> 00:51:50,880
things so badly that it would be better

1309
00:51:46,680 --> 00:51:54,630
that they didn't exist at all well you

1310
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:56,000
see stories there's a story associated

1311
00:51:54,630 --> 00:51:57,720
with this in the epic of gilgamesh

1312
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:00,000
associated with the flood that has

1313
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:01,440
exactly the same underlying narrative

1314
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,970
structure in fact some people think the

1315
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:06,809
story of Noah was derived from it where

1316
00:52:02,970 --> 00:52:10,140
the gods who created repented of their

1317
00:52:06,809 --> 00:52:11,700
creation and determined that erasing it

1318
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:13,470
would be better than allowing it to

1319
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:15,450
propagate and you see the same thing in

1320
00:52:13,470 --> 00:52:18,930
the Mesopotamian creation myth you knew

1321
00:52:15,450 --> 00:52:21,809
mulisch because the early gods so

1322
00:52:18,930 --> 00:52:24,089
they're representatives of the Giants of

1323
00:52:21,809 --> 00:52:27,569
humanity I would say make so much noise

1324
00:52:24,089 --> 00:52:29,790
and are so careless that the original

1325
00:52:27,569 --> 00:52:32,130
creator God timeout and and her consort

1326
00:52:29,790 --> 00:52:39,569
time app decides to wipe them from the

1327
00:52:32,130 --> 00:52:41,790
face of the earth and so when you read

1328
00:52:39,569 --> 00:52:44,250
something like this if you read it from

1329
00:52:41,790 --> 00:52:47,210
an informed historical perspective it

1330
00:52:44,250 --> 00:52:50,970
starts to have a depth that makes it

1331
00:52:47,210 --> 00:52:52,260
transcend this sort of archaic and fairy

1332
00:52:50,970 --> 00:52:55,650
tale like

1333
00:52:52,260 --> 00:52:57,450
element of the story it's like I've read

1334
00:52:55,650 --> 00:52:59,760
some very terrible things about what

1335
00:52:57,450 --> 00:53:01,700
happened in Nazi Germany and and what

1336
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:04,110
happened when the Japanese invaded China

1337
00:53:01,700 --> 00:53:08,310
and just what happened generally in the

1338
00:53:04,110 --> 00:53:11,160
history of mankind and things can get so

1339
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:13,470
bad that it takes the imagination of a

1340
00:53:11,160 --> 00:53:18,150
very bad person to conceptualize them

1341
00:53:13,470 --> 00:53:19,530
and when they get that bad this is the

1342
00:53:18,150 --> 00:53:21,450
only kind of language that works to

1343
00:53:19,530 --> 00:53:23,910
describe them you know that's another

1344
00:53:21,450 --> 00:53:26,610
thing that I've discovered working with

1345
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:30,600
my clinical clients is that when their

1346
00:53:26,610 --> 00:53:33,060
lives are really not going well you know

1347
00:53:30,600 --> 00:53:35,640
when they're close to suicide or when

1348
00:53:33,060 --> 00:53:37,200
they're close to homicide or when there

1349
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:39,000
are things going on in the family that

1350
00:53:37,200 --> 00:53:40,740
are so corrupt and terrible that they

1351
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,540
reach back generations and they're aimed

1352
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:45,510
at nothing but misery and destruction

1353
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:48,210
the only language that suffices

1354
00:53:45,510 --> 00:53:49,500
has a religious tone because there's

1355
00:53:48,210 --> 00:53:51,570
nothing else that's available to

1356
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:53,700
describe what's happening with the

1357
00:53:51,570 --> 00:53:55,290
proper level of seriousness and it might

1358
00:53:53,700 --> 00:53:57,810
be that you've never encountered a

1359
00:53:55,290 --> 00:53:59,310
situation that required that level of

1360
00:53:57,810 --> 00:54:02,840
seriousness but that doesn't mean that

1361
00:53:59,310 --> 00:54:05,910
those situations don't exist they exist

1362
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:08,520
you generally do everything you can to

1363
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:10,350
avoid being ensconced in them but they

1364
00:54:08,520 --> 00:54:11,970
certainly do exist and the probability

1365
00:54:10,350 --> 00:54:13,920
that you'll encounter a situation like

1366
00:54:11,970 --> 00:54:16,050
that or two at some point in your life

1367
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:18,330
is extraordinarily high you'll tangle

1368
00:54:16,050 --> 00:54:21,360
with someone who's malevolent right to

1369
00:54:18,330 --> 00:54:24,120
the core and maybe it'll be you that is

1370
00:54:21,360 --> 00:54:25,820
and that'll be a big shock and then

1371
00:54:24,120 --> 00:54:28,290
these sorts of things these sorts of

1372
00:54:25,820 --> 00:54:31,740
poetic descriptors start to become much

1373
00:54:28,290 --> 00:54:34,680
more real but Noah found grace in the

1374
00:54:31,740 --> 00:54:37,950
eyes of the Lord these are the

1375
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:40,590
generations of Noah Noah was a just man

1376
00:54:37,950 --> 00:54:42,690
and perfect in his generations and Noah

1377
00:54:40,590 --> 00:54:44,730
walked with God that's an interesting

1378
00:54:42,690 --> 00:54:47,580
line because if you remember back in the

1379
00:54:44,730 --> 00:54:50,490
story of Adam and Eve what happens to

1380
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:51,870
Adam once he eats the fruit of the tree

1381
00:54:50,490 --> 00:54:54,000
of the knowledge of good and evil and

1382
00:54:51,870 --> 00:54:55,920
wakes up the scales fall from his eyes

1383
00:54:54,000 --> 00:54:57,480
become self-conscious develops the

1384
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:59,340
knowledge of good and evil is he won't

1385
00:54:57,480 --> 00:55:03,150
walk with God when God calls him in the

1386
00:54:59,340 --> 00:55:05,280
garden and so Noah is Adam without the

1387
00:55:03,150 --> 00:55:05,790
fall essentially and there's something

1388
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:12,240
that knows

1389
00:55:05,790 --> 00:55:14,550
right that motivates God to spare him or

1390
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:16,260
maybe to show him a pathway through the

1391
00:55:14,550 --> 00:55:18,630
emergent chaos something like that and

1392
00:55:16,260 --> 00:55:21,180
that's worth thinking about a lot

1393
00:55:18,630 --> 00:55:23,610
because there will be situations in your

1394
00:55:21,180 --> 00:55:26,220
life where what you face is the emergent

1395
00:55:23,610 --> 00:55:28,800
chaos and maybe that'll be some terrible

1396
00:55:26,220 --> 00:55:30,330
catastrophe inside your family or maybe

1397
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:34,080
it'll be something that's occurring on a

1398
00:55:30,330 --> 00:55:36,210
much broader social level but the chaos

1399
00:55:34,080 --> 00:55:37,800
is coming and what you're going to want

1400
00:55:36,210 --> 00:55:39,930
to know unless you want to be a denizen

1401
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:41,220
of the chaos or even a contributor to it

1402
00:55:39,930 --> 00:55:42,540
and perhaps that is what you want

1403
00:55:41,220 --> 00:55:47,430
because many people under those

1404
00:55:42,540 --> 00:55:52,860
circumstances choose that what you want

1405
00:55:47,430 --> 00:55:57,780
is to know how you build an ark and get

1406
00:55:52,860 --> 00:55:59,460
through it that's what you if you're if

1407
00:55:57,780 --> 00:56:02,300
you're interested in life if you're

1408
00:55:59,460 --> 00:56:05,310
interested in proper being and you're

1409
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:07,080
disinclined to produce any more

1410
00:56:05,310 --> 00:56:09,120
suffering than necessary then you want

1411
00:56:07,080 --> 00:56:11,280
to know how to conduct yourself when the

1412
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:14,970
catastrophe comes so that you have a

1413
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:18,840
reasonable possibility of of moving

1414
00:56:14,970 --> 00:56:23,640
through it and starting anew so when

1415
00:56:18,840 --> 00:56:25,200
when this old story says well God's not

1416
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:27,360
happy he's going to wipe everything out

1417
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:33,090
it's like well you might want to take

1418
00:56:27,360 --> 00:56:34,980
that seriously and then when it says but

1419
00:56:33,090 --> 00:56:36,480
there's one person who had a mode of

1420
00:56:34,980 --> 00:56:38,160
being that protected him from that

1421
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:39,990
that's also something you might want to

1422
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:41,670
take seriously because you might want to

1423
00:56:39,990 --> 00:56:43,980
know what that mode of being is because

1424
00:56:41,670 --> 00:56:45,540
you might need to use it and so these

1425
00:56:43,980 --> 00:56:47,970
sorts of things are practical in the

1426
00:56:45,540 --> 00:56:49,770
deepest possible sense they're real in

1427
00:56:47,970 --> 00:56:53,130
the deepest possible sense and practical

1428
00:56:49,770 --> 00:56:56,430
in the deepest possible sense so Noah

1429
00:56:53,130 --> 00:57:00,100
walked with God now I'm going to switch

1430
00:56:56,430 --> 00:57:02,440
way ahead here because

1431
00:57:00,100 --> 00:57:06,100
you know they said at the beginning of

1432
00:57:02,440 --> 00:57:08,050
the lecture series that the Bible is a

1433
00:57:06,100 --> 00:57:11,620
hyperlinked text and everything refers

1434
00:57:08,050 --> 00:57:13,510
to everything else and so there's

1435
00:57:11,620 --> 00:57:15,400
utility in reading it in linear order

1436
00:57:13,510 --> 00:57:18,490
but it's not a linear document it's a

1437
00:57:15,400 --> 00:57:21,790
document that that you can move through

1438
00:57:18,490 --> 00:57:24,250
in an infinite number of there's an

1439
00:57:21,790 --> 00:57:26,800
infinite number of pathways that you can

1440
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:29,950
use to walk through it and all of the

1441
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:33,040
document expands upon and refers to all

1442
00:57:29,950 --> 00:57:34,600
of the rest of the document and so I'm

1443
00:57:33,040 --> 00:57:36,250
going to switch to the sermon on the

1444
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:39,070
mount which i think is probably the key

1445
00:57:36,250 --> 00:57:40,720
document in the New Testament and I'm

1446
00:57:39,070 --> 00:57:44,350
going to switch to it because I think

1447
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:47,980
it's the closest thing we have to a

1448
00:57:44,350 --> 00:57:50,380
fully articulated description of what it

1449
00:57:47,980 --> 00:57:52,710
would mean to walk with God so that

1450
00:57:50,380 --> 00:57:56,880
you're in the ark when the flood comes

1451
00:57:52,710 --> 00:57:59,620
it's the it's the most fully articulated

1452
00:57:56,880 --> 00:58:01,990
realization of that idea that that leaps

1453
00:57:59,620 --> 00:58:03,490
out of the metaphorical because if I say

1454
00:58:01,990 --> 00:58:05,410
well you should conduct yourself like

1455
00:58:03,490 --> 00:58:08,010
Noah and walk with God and build an ark

1456
00:58:05,410 --> 00:58:11,020
obviously those are poetic and

1457
00:58:08,010 --> 00:58:12,940
metaphorical suggestions and it's not

1458
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:15,430
that easy to bring them into practice

1459
00:58:12,940 --> 00:58:17,020
right it's the distance there's a big

1460
00:58:15,430 --> 00:58:18,910
distance between you and the archetype

1461
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:21,520
it isn't obvious how to manifest it in

1462
00:58:18,910 --> 00:58:22,930
your own life and what has to happen is

1463
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:25,920
the archetype has to be differentiated

1464
00:58:22,930 --> 00:58:28,510
and articulated so that it becomes

1465
00:58:25,920 --> 00:58:29,920
sufficiently practical and personal so

1466
00:58:28,510 --> 00:58:31,360
that you can actually implement it so

1467
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:32,170
I'm going to take apart some of the

1468
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:34,840
Sermon on the Mount

1469
00:58:32,170 --> 00:58:36,190
it starts in Matthew five and I'm not

1470
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:38,020
going to talk about Matthew five I'm

1471
00:58:36,190 --> 00:58:42,340
going to talk about the end of Matthew

1472
00:58:38,020 --> 00:58:43,900
six and most of Matthew seven consider

1473
00:58:42,340 --> 00:58:47,410
the lilies of the field how they grow

1474
00:58:43,900 --> 00:58:51,280
they toil not neither do they spin and

1475
00:58:47,410 --> 00:58:53,050
yet I say unto you that even Solomon in

1476
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:57,430
all his glory was not arrayed like one

1477
00:58:53,050 --> 00:58:59,710
of these wherefore if God so clothes the

1478
00:58:57,430 --> 00:59:01,630
grass of the field which today is and

1479
00:58:59,710 --> 00:59:04,480
tomorrow is cast into the oven shall he

1480
00:59:01,630 --> 00:59:06,490
not much more clothe you O ye of little

1481
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:08,620
faith therefore take no Thought saying

1482
00:59:06,490 --> 00:59:12,370
what shall we eat or what shall we drink

1483
00:59:08,620 --> 00:59:13,870
or wherewithal shall we be clothed those

1484
00:59:12,370 --> 00:59:18,000
are famous lines and that's our

1485
00:59:13,870 --> 00:59:20,020
Christ the hippie right it's like hey

1486
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:23,550
let it all hang out

1487
00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:26,980
that's an old phrase do your thing and

1488
00:59:23,550 --> 00:59:28,630
everything will come to you and these

1489
00:59:26,980 --> 00:59:32,860
lines have been interpreted in that

1490
00:59:28,630 --> 00:59:36,490
manner many times but that's seriously

1491
00:59:32,860 --> 00:59:39,220
not the proper interpretation because

1492
00:59:36,490 --> 00:59:45,130
there's a kicker with this injunction

1493
00:59:39,220 --> 00:59:47,200
and the kicker is this for your heavenly

1494
00:59:45,130 --> 00:59:50,140
Father knows that you have need of all

1495
00:59:47,200 --> 00:59:51,970
these things but seek ye first the

1496
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:53,560
kingdom of God and His righteousness and

1497
00:59:51,970 --> 00:59:55,480
all these things shall be added unto you

1498
00:59:53,560 --> 00:59:58,810
that's a lot different than the hippie

1499
00:59:55,480 --> 01:00:01,150
thing right because there's a very very

1500
00:59:58,810 --> 01:00:02,830
very interesting idea here it's it's

1501
01:00:01,150 --> 01:00:06,550
certainly one of the most profound ideas

1502
01:00:02,830 --> 01:00:09,670
that I've ever encountered and the idea

1503
01:00:06,550 --> 01:00:12,760
is this is that if you configure your

1504
01:00:09,670 --> 01:00:15,400
life so that what you are genuinely

1505
01:00:12,760 --> 01:00:20,980
doing is aiming at the highest possible

1506
01:00:15,400 --> 01:00:24,130
good then the things that you need to to

1507
01:00:20,980 --> 01:00:27,750
survive and to thrive on a day to day

1508
01:00:24,130 --> 01:00:30,820
basis will deliver themselves to you

1509
01:00:27,750 --> 01:00:32,740
that's a hypothesis and it's not some

1510
01:00:30,820 --> 01:00:34,810
simple hypothesis right because it what

1511
01:00:32,740 --> 01:00:36,190
it basically says is if you dare to do

1512
01:00:34,810 --> 01:00:38,470
the most difficult thing that you can

1513
01:00:36,190 --> 01:00:40,480
conceptualize your life will work out

1514
01:00:38,470 --> 01:00:42,790
better than it will if you do anything

1515
01:00:40,480 --> 01:00:44,890
else well how are you going to find out

1516
01:00:42,790 --> 01:00:46,150
if that's true well it's a Kierkegaard

1517
01:00:44,890 --> 01:00:47,260
ian's leap of faith there's no way

1518
01:00:46,150 --> 01:00:49,930
you're going to find out whether or not

1519
01:00:47,260 --> 01:00:52,900
that's true unless you do it so no one

1520
01:00:49,930 --> 01:00:54,550
no one can tell you either because just

1521
01:00:52,900 --> 01:00:56,890
because it works for someone else I mean

1522
01:00:54,550 --> 01:00:58,480
that's interesting and all that but it's

1523
01:00:56,890 --> 01:01:00,910
no proof that it'll work for you you

1524
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:03,790
have to be all-in in this game and so

1525
01:01:00,910 --> 01:01:05,410
the idea is seek ye first the kingdom of

1526
01:01:03,790 --> 01:01:08,490
God and His righteousness it's like

1527
01:01:05,410 --> 01:01:11,530
that's actually a fairly important

1528
01:01:08,490 --> 01:01:13,150
caution when you're talking about not

1529
01:01:11,530 --> 01:01:14,200
having to pay attention to what you're

1530
01:01:13,150 --> 01:01:16,840
going to eat or what you're going to

1531
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:18,310
wear it's like what it's essentially

1532
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:20,290
saying is that those problems are

1533
01:01:18,310 --> 01:01:22,180
trivial in comparison and the

1534
01:01:20,290 --> 01:01:24,520
probability is that if you manifest

1535
01:01:22,180 --> 01:01:26,950
yourself properly in the world that

1536
01:01:24,520 --> 01:01:28,750
those things will come your way

1537
01:01:26,950 --> 01:01:30,460
is extraordinarily high and I believe I

1538
01:01:28,750 --> 01:01:33,130
believe that that's exactly right

1539
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:37,599
I mean I've watched people operate in

1540
01:01:33,130 --> 01:01:39,730
the world and I would say that there is

1541
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:41,650
no more effective way of operating in

1542
01:01:39,730 --> 01:01:43,990
the world than to conceptualize the

1543
01:01:41,650 --> 01:01:47,609
highest good that you can and then

1544
01:01:43,990 --> 01:01:51,280
strive to attain it there's no more

1545
01:01:47,609 --> 01:01:53,589
practical pathway to the kind of success

1546
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:57,930
that you could have if you actually knew

1547
01:01:53,589 --> 01:02:01,800
what success was and so that's what this

1548
01:01:57,930 --> 01:02:06,640
that's what this sermon is attempting to

1549
01:02:01,800 --> 01:02:08,380
to posit it's like in in the story of

1550
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:10,329
Pinocchio you know what happens at the

1551
01:02:08,380 --> 01:02:13,030
beginning of the story of Pinocchio is

1552
01:02:10,329 --> 01:02:14,290
that Geppetto wishes on a star we talked

1553
01:02:13,030 --> 01:02:17,470
about that a little bit and so what you

1554
01:02:14,290 --> 01:02:19,270
pedo does is align himself with the

1555
01:02:17,470 --> 01:02:21,790
metaphorical manifestation of the

1556
01:02:19,270 --> 01:02:25,240
highest good he can conceptualize and

1557
01:02:21,790 --> 01:02:29,349
say he says he makes he makes a

1558
01:02:25,240 --> 01:02:31,359
commitment let's say he aims at the star

1559
01:02:29,349 --> 01:02:34,200
and for him the star is the possibility

1560
01:02:31,359 --> 01:02:36,700
that he can take his creation a puppet

1561
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:39,400
right whose strings are being pulled by

1562
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:42,960
unseen forces and have it transformed

1563
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:46,060
into something that's economist and real

1564
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:47,589
well that's a hell of an ambition you

1565
01:02:46,060 --> 01:02:50,290
know and we're wise enough to put that

1566
01:02:47,589 --> 01:02:52,540
in the children's movie but too foolish

1567
01:02:50,290 --> 01:02:54,819
to understand what it means it's such an

1568
01:02:52,540 --> 01:02:56,710
interesting juxtaposition that that we

1569
01:02:54,819 --> 01:02:58,630
can both know that and not know it at

1570
01:02:56,710 --> 01:03:00,579
the same time you can go to the movie

1571
01:02:58,630 --> 01:03:01,810
you can watch it and it makes sense but

1572
01:03:00,579 --> 01:03:03,310
that doesn't mean that you can go home

1573
01:03:01,810 --> 01:03:05,650
and think well I know what that meant

1574
01:03:03,310 --> 01:03:07,119
well people are complicated right we

1575
01:03:05,650 --> 01:03:08,410
exist at different levels and all the

1576
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:11,290
levels don't communicate with one

1577
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:14,349
another but but the movie is a

1578
01:03:11,290 --> 01:03:16,329
hypothesis and the hypothesis is there's

1579
01:03:14,349 --> 01:03:20,530
no better pathway to self-realization

1580
01:03:16,329 --> 01:03:22,300
and the annulment of being than to posit

1581
01:03:20,530 --> 01:03:24,910
the highest good that you can conceive

1582
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:26,770
of and commit yourself to it and then

1583
01:03:24,910 --> 01:03:29,170
you might also ask yourself and this is

1584
01:03:26,770 --> 01:03:31,569
definitely worth asking is do you really

1585
01:03:29,170 --> 01:03:33,069
have anything better to do and if you

1586
01:03:31,569 --> 01:03:37,750
don't well why would you do anything

1587
01:03:33,069 --> 01:03:39,099
else therefore take no thought for the

1588
01:03:37,750 --> 01:03:40,960
morrow for the morrow shall take thought

1589
01:03:39,099 --> 01:03:44,620
for the things of itself sufficient

1590
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:45,850
unto the day is the evil thereof I spend

1591
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:47,440
a long time trying to figure out without

1592
01:03:45,850 --> 01:03:54,880
man to because it's another one of those

1593
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:56,680
lines that can easily be read as program

1594
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:58,180
offer and anti amped you know you

1595
01:03:56,680 --> 01:04:00,190
remember the old fable of the

1596
01:03:58,180 --> 01:04:04,870
grasshopper in the end maybe not I'm not

1597
01:04:00,190 --> 01:04:07,030
going to tell it but that works in the

1598
01:04:04,870 --> 01:04:08,260
grasshopper fiddles and the ant has a

1599
01:04:07,030 --> 01:04:10,780
pretty good time in the winter and the

1600
01:04:08,260 --> 01:04:12,820
grasshopper dies and so this is like a

1601
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:14,590
pro grasshopper line but it's not

1602
01:04:12,820 --> 01:04:19,290
because it says something else it says

1603
01:04:14,590 --> 01:04:21,880
that if you orient yourself properly and

1604
01:04:19,290 --> 01:04:25,540
then pay attention to what you do every

1605
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:27,400
day that works and I actually think that

1606
01:04:25,540 --> 01:04:28,690
that's in accordance with what we have

1607
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:30,630
come to understand about human

1608
01:04:28,690 --> 01:04:34,990
perception because what happens is that

1609
01:04:30,630 --> 01:04:37,960
the world shifts itself around your aim

1610
01:04:34,990 --> 01:04:39,400
is you're a creature that has a name you

1611
01:04:37,960 --> 01:04:41,200
have to have a name in order to do

1612
01:04:39,400 --> 01:04:43,990
something you're an aiming creature you

1613
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:46,660
look at a point and you move towards it

1614
01:04:43,990 --> 01:04:48,130
it's built right into you and so you

1615
01:04:46,660 --> 01:04:50,740
have a name well let's say your aim is

1616
01:04:48,130 --> 01:04:53,160
the highest possible aim well then so

1617
01:04:50,740 --> 01:04:55,300
that sets up the world around you it

1618
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:57,310
organizes all of your perceptions it

1619
01:04:55,300 --> 01:04:58,930
organizes what you see and you don't see

1620
01:04:57,310 --> 01:05:01,360
it organizes your emotions and your

1621
01:04:58,930 --> 01:05:03,340
motivations so you organize yourself

1622
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:05,920
around that aim and then what happens is

1623
01:05:03,340 --> 01:05:08,470
the day manifests itself as a set of

1624
01:05:05,920 --> 01:05:10,930
challenges and problems and if you solve

1625
01:05:08,470 --> 01:05:12,700
them properly then you stay on the

1626
01:05:10,930 --> 01:05:14,740
pathway towards that ape and you can

1627
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:16,210
concentrate on the on the ate on the day

1628
01:05:14,740 --> 01:05:18,580
and so that way you get to have your

1629
01:05:16,210 --> 01:05:20,770
cake and eat it too because you can you

1630
01:05:18,580 --> 01:05:24,840
can point into the distance the far

1631
01:05:20,770 --> 01:05:28,120
distance and you can live in the day and

1632
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:30,100
it seems to me that that's that makes

1633
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:31,840
every moment of the day super charged

1634
01:05:30,100 --> 01:05:33,760
with meaning that that's how because if

1635
01:05:31,840 --> 01:05:35,950
everything that you're doing every day

1636
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:38,020
is related to the highest possible aim

1637
01:05:35,950 --> 01:05:39,730
that you can conceptualize well that's

1638
01:05:38,020 --> 01:05:42,040
the very definition of the meaning that

1639
01:05:39,730 --> 01:05:44,470
would sustain you in your life well then

1640
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:46,150
the issue is well back to Noah well all

1641
01:05:44,470 --> 01:05:47,230
hell is about to break loose and chaos

1642
01:05:46,150 --> 01:05:49,300
is coming it's like when that's

1643
01:05:47,230 --> 01:05:50,770
happening in your life you might want to

1644
01:05:49,300 --> 01:05:53,440
be doing something that you regard is

1645
01:05:50,770 --> 01:05:54,690
truly worthwhile because that's what

1646
01:05:53,440 --> 01:05:58,839
will keep you afloat

1647
01:05:54,690 --> 01:06:01,079
when when everything is flooded and you

1648
01:05:58,839 --> 01:06:04,599
don't want to wait until the flood comes

1649
01:06:01,079 --> 01:06:06,460
to start doing that because if your arks

1650
01:06:04,599 --> 01:06:09,130
half built and you don't know how to

1651
01:06:06,460 --> 01:06:17,470
captain it the probability is very high

1652
01:06:09,130 --> 01:06:19,239
that that you'll drown take therefore no

1653
01:06:17,470 --> 01:06:20,769
thought for the morale but for the

1654
01:06:19,239 --> 01:06:23,470
morale shall take thought for the things

1655
01:06:20,769 --> 01:06:27,670
of itself sufficient unto the day is the

1656
01:06:23,470 --> 01:06:34,420
evil thereof that's not a particularly

1657
01:06:27,670 --> 01:06:36,789
optimistic formulation judge not that ye

1658
01:06:34,420 --> 01:06:38,559
be not judged for with what judgment you

1659
01:06:36,789 --> 01:06:40,210
judge you shall be judged and with what

1660
01:06:38,559 --> 01:06:47,259
measure you mete it shall be measured to

1661
01:06:40,210 --> 01:06:48,789
you again it's a sensible piece of it's

1662
01:06:47,259 --> 01:06:50,170
a sensible description I wouldn't call

1663
01:06:48,789 --> 01:06:51,789
it a piece of advice because I don't

1664
01:06:50,170 --> 01:06:53,049
think that any of this is advice it's a

1665
01:06:51,789 --> 01:06:55,720
description of the structure of reality

1666
01:06:53,049 --> 01:06:58,150
that's not the same as advice and it

1667
01:06:55,720 --> 01:07:00,489
basically says that you'll be held

1668
01:06:58,150 --> 01:07:04,239
accountable by the rules of the game

1669
01:07:00,489 --> 01:07:06,309
that you choose to play and that I also

1670
01:07:04,239 --> 01:07:07,839
think is perfectly in keeping with what

1671
01:07:06,309 --> 01:07:11,380
we understand about human psychology

1672
01:07:07,839 --> 01:07:13,059
because you you are playing you have to

1673
01:07:11,380 --> 01:07:14,650
play a game that other people will allow

1674
01:07:13,059 --> 01:07:15,759
you to play and that will cooperate with

1675
01:07:14,650 --> 01:07:17,109
you while you're playing and it will

1676
01:07:15,759 --> 01:07:19,720
compete with you while you're playing it

1677
01:07:17,109 --> 01:07:21,190
but you have a fair bit of flexibility

1678
01:07:19,720 --> 01:07:22,660
in setting up the parameters of the game

1679
01:07:21,190 --> 01:07:24,130
but you don't have any choice about

1680
01:07:22,660 --> 01:07:27,339
whether or not you're going to be in a

1681
01:07:24,130 --> 01:07:29,109
game you're in a game and you're going

1682
01:07:27,339 --> 01:07:30,849
to be held accountable by the rules of

1683
01:07:29,109 --> 01:07:34,420
the game because that's how the game

1684
01:07:30,849 --> 01:07:38,019
works and so you might want to pick a

1685
01:07:34,420 --> 01:07:42,279
game by whose rules you would be willing

1686
01:07:38,019 --> 01:07:43,779
to be held accountable and why beholdest

1687
01:07:42,279 --> 01:07:46,029
thou the mote that is in thy brother's

1688
01:07:43,779 --> 01:07:49,329
eye but considerest not the beam that is

1689
01:07:46,029 --> 01:07:51,249
in thine own eye or how will you say to

1690
01:07:49,329 --> 01:07:53,170
thy brother let me pull out the mote out

1691
01:07:51,249 --> 01:07:55,239
of thine eye and behold a beam is in

1692
01:07:53,170 --> 01:07:58,420
thine own eye well you might be

1693
01:07:55,239 --> 01:08:02,440
wondering what a beam is and a mote is a

1694
01:07:58,420 --> 01:08:04,839
dust speck and a beam is a very large

1695
01:08:02,440 --> 01:08:07,869
piece of lumber

1696
01:08:04,839 --> 01:08:10,839
and so the issue is not so much the

1697
01:08:07,869 --> 01:08:13,569
blindness of others even though there's

1698
01:08:10,839 --> 01:08:18,549
as much blindness among others as there

1699
01:08:13,569 --> 01:08:20,799
is as there is for you but that issue

1700
01:08:18,549 --> 01:08:23,109
here the advice here the description

1701
01:08:20,799 --> 01:08:24,520
here is you should be concerned about

1702
01:08:23,109 --> 01:08:27,159
what's interfering with your own vision

1703
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:29,469
first and you should leave other people

1704
01:08:27,159 --> 01:08:31,630
the hell alone in relationship to that

1705
01:08:29,469 --> 01:08:33,969
and so if your mode of being in the

1706
01:08:31,630 --> 01:08:38,230
world is if you would just act better

1707
01:08:33,969 --> 01:08:40,330
things would improve for me or if you

1708
01:08:38,230 --> 01:08:42,909
identify the evil and the catastrophe is

1709
01:08:40,330 --> 01:08:44,409
something that's outside that someone

1710
01:08:42,909 --> 01:08:46,179
else needs to fix or that someone's

1711
01:08:44,409 --> 01:08:56,290
response someone else is responsible for

1712
01:08:46,179 --> 01:08:59,199
then then you're not going to fix that

1713
01:08:56,290 --> 01:09:00,849
and you're going to remain blind to the

1714
01:08:59,199 --> 01:09:03,489
things that you're doing and not doing

1715
01:09:00,849 --> 01:09:05,739
that make things not go well and so it's

1716
01:09:03,489 --> 01:09:07,750
just better to think all right I'm

1717
01:09:05,739 --> 01:09:10,210
probably blind in many many ways

1718
01:09:07,750 --> 01:09:12,099
and maybe there are some ways that I

1719
01:09:10,210 --> 01:09:13,659
could rectify that because it's highly

1720
01:09:12,099 --> 01:09:15,849
probable that you're blind in all sorts

1721
01:09:13,659 --> 01:09:19,060
of ways I mean it's in fact it's

1722
01:09:15,849 --> 01:09:22,869
virtually certain and so it's just more

1723
01:09:19,060 --> 01:09:24,730
useful to think how is it that I'm wrong

1724
01:09:22,869 --> 01:09:26,710
in this situation I'll tell you

1725
01:09:24,730 --> 01:09:28,569
something that I learned to do when I

1726
01:09:26,710 --> 01:09:31,900
was arguing with my wife which happened

1727
01:09:28,569 --> 01:09:33,520
quite frequently because when you

1728
01:09:31,900 --> 01:09:34,960
actually communicate with people you

1729
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:36,969
find out that there's many things that

1730
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:38,440
you don't agree on and that's because

1731
01:09:36,969 --> 01:09:40,480
you're actually different creatures and

1732
01:09:38,440 --> 01:09:41,949
so if you're actually going to have a

1733
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:44,409
truthful conversation then you're going

1734
01:09:41,949 --> 01:09:46,150
to find out that you don't see things

1735
01:09:44,409 --> 01:09:48,069
the same way and then you can either

1736
01:09:46,150 --> 01:09:50,469
pretend that that's not the case and

1737
01:09:48,069 --> 01:09:55,030
gloss over it and then end up in a 30

1738
01:09:50,469 --> 01:09:56,860
year silent war or you can or you can

1739
01:09:55,030 --> 01:09:58,119
have the damn fight when you need to

1740
01:09:56,860 --> 01:10:01,719
have it and see if you could straighten

1741
01:09:58,119 --> 01:10:03,310
it out so now and then we'd get in a

1742
01:10:01,719 --> 01:10:06,219
situation where we were at loggerheads

1743
01:10:03,310 --> 01:10:09,489
we couldn't move and you know it would

1744
01:10:06,219 --> 01:10:11,920
spiral up into hate speech let's say cuz

1745
01:10:09,489 --> 01:10:13,389
yeah everyone laughs because they know

1746
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:16,659
they manifest plenty of hate speech

1747
01:10:13,389 --> 01:10:18,550
towards those they loved so one of the

1748
01:10:16,659 --> 01:10:22,300
things we learned to do was when we

1749
01:10:18,550 --> 01:10:24,909
hit an impasse was to separate and to go

1750
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:28,989
our own ways and to go sit and think

1751
01:10:24,909 --> 01:10:30,460
okay look we're at this unpleasant

1752
01:10:28,989 --> 01:10:33,579
situation can't figure out how to move

1753
01:10:30,460 --> 01:10:37,809
forward I'd always think of course it's

1754
01:10:33,579 --> 01:10:41,860
her fault obviously it's her fault least

1755
01:10:37,809 --> 01:10:44,679
95 percent but maybe there was something

1756
01:10:41,860 --> 01:10:47,880
I did that contributed like five percent

1757
01:10:44,679 --> 01:10:51,760
to it and so I would sit and think and

1758
01:10:47,880 --> 01:10:53,110
ask myself a question which was is there

1759
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:55,380
anything I did in the last six months

1760
01:10:53,110 --> 01:10:58,570
that increased the probability that this

1761
01:10:55,380 --> 01:11:00,520
impasse would manifest itself and I'll

1762
01:10:58,570 --> 01:11:01,929
tell you you have no idea how fast your

1763
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:04,030
mind will generate an answer to a

1764
01:11:01,929 --> 01:11:05,980
question like that because there's

1765
01:11:04,030 --> 01:11:08,230
undoubtedly some idiotic thing that you

1766
01:11:05,980 --> 01:11:09,670
did that you know that you remember that

1767
01:11:08,230 --> 01:11:11,199
increase the probability that you're

1768
01:11:09,670 --> 01:11:12,790
going to have your hands around the

1769
01:11:11,199 --> 01:11:15,909
throat of the person that you love and

1770
01:11:12,790 --> 01:11:17,889
then you can go tell them that and then

1771
01:11:15,909 --> 01:11:19,840
you can have a conversation especially

1772
01:11:17,889 --> 01:11:22,360
if they do the same thing say look you

1773
01:11:19,840 --> 01:11:25,239
know here's how I'm an idiot in this

1774
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:27,400
situation now the person says well yeah

1775
01:11:25,239 --> 01:11:28,869
here's how I'm an idiot and then you're

1776
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:32,559
two idiots and then maybe you can have a

1777
01:11:28,869 --> 01:11:34,690
conversation so thou hypocrite first

1778
01:11:32,559 --> 01:11:36,489
cast out the beam of light out of thine

1779
01:11:34,690 --> 01:11:38,710
own eye and then shalt thou see clearly

1780
01:11:36,489 --> 01:11:43,119
to cast out the mote of thy brother's

1781
01:11:38,710 --> 01:11:45,040
eye that's a hard argue with that ask

1782
01:11:43,119 --> 01:11:46,510
and it shall be given you seek and ye

1783
01:11:45,040 --> 01:11:48,190
shall find knock and it shall be opened

1784
01:11:46,510 --> 01:11:50,530
unto you for every one that asketh

1785
01:11:48,190 --> 01:11:52,389
receiveth and he that seeketh findeth

1786
01:11:50,530 --> 01:11:55,570
and to him that knocketh it shall be

1787
01:11:52,389 --> 01:11:59,110
opened have some pretty optimistic again

1788
01:11:55,570 --> 01:12:00,579
but but again I think it's a description

1789
01:11:59,110 --> 01:12:05,760
of the structure of the existential

1790
01:12:00,579 --> 01:12:05,760
reality and and but by by which I mean

1791
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:10,510
when I'm in my clinical practice and I

1792
01:12:08,980 --> 01:12:13,179
observe and this is also the case with

1793
01:12:10,510 --> 01:12:15,159
my students is let's say people's lives

1794
01:12:13,179 --> 01:12:18,820
aren't what they would like them to be

1795
01:12:15,159 --> 01:12:21,010
and so then you ask why well forget

1796
01:12:18,820 --> 01:12:23,260
about tragedy in catastrophe because

1797
01:12:21,010 --> 01:12:25,239
that's self-evident and we're not going

1798
01:12:23,260 --> 01:12:27,280
to discuss that although the degree to

1799
01:12:25,239 --> 01:12:30,340
which you bring about your own tragedy

1800
01:12:27,280 --> 01:12:32,180
is always indeterminate but I would

1801
01:12:30,340 --> 01:12:34,430
never say that every terror

1802
01:12:32,180 --> 01:12:37,160
thing that is visited on a person is

1803
01:12:34,430 --> 01:12:39,140
something they deserved I think that

1804
01:12:37,160 --> 01:12:41,300
that's a very dangerous presupposition

1805
01:12:39,140 --> 01:12:48,200
especially because everyone gets sick

1806
01:12:41,300 --> 01:12:49,400
and everyone dies but one of the main

1807
01:12:48,200 --> 01:12:50,810
reasons that people don't get what they

1808
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:54,230
want is because they don't actually

1809
01:12:50,810 --> 01:12:55,790
figure out what it is and the

1810
01:12:54,230 --> 01:12:57,380
probability that you're going to get

1811
01:12:55,790 --> 01:12:58,760
what would be good for you let's say

1812
01:12:57,380 --> 01:13:00,770
which would even be better than what you

1813
01:12:58,760 --> 01:13:03,200
want right because you know you might be

1814
01:13:00,770 --> 01:13:04,880
what wrong about what you want easily

1815
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:08,600
but maybe you could get what would

1816
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:12,620
really be good for you well why don't

1817
01:13:08,600 --> 01:13:16,100
you well because you don't try you don't

1818
01:13:12,620 --> 01:13:18,770
think okay here's what I would like if I

1819
01:13:16,100 --> 01:13:21,080
could have it and I don't mean I don't

1820
01:13:18,770 --> 01:13:23,600
mean in a way that you manipulate the

1821
01:13:21,080 --> 01:13:25,670
world to force it to deliver you goods

1822
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:27,970
for status or something like that that

1823
01:13:25,670 --> 01:13:29,870
isn't what I mean I mean something like

1824
01:13:27,970 --> 01:13:31,160
imagine that you are taking care of

1825
01:13:29,870 --> 01:13:33,440
yourself like you were someone you

1826
01:13:31,160 --> 01:13:35,600
actually cared for and then you thought

1827
01:13:33,440 --> 01:13:37,550
okay I'm caring for this person I would

1828
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:38,120
like things to go as well for them as

1829
01:13:37,550 --> 01:13:40,250
possible

1830
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:43,040
what would their life have to be like in

1831
01:13:40,250 --> 01:13:44,570
order for that to be the case what

1832
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:46,070
people don't do that they don't sit down

1833
01:13:44,570 --> 01:13:47,780
and think all right you know let's let's

1834
01:13:46,070 --> 01:13:50,720
figure it out you've got a life that's

1835
01:13:47,780 --> 01:13:53,080
hard obviously it's like three years

1836
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:55,730
from now you can have what you need

1837
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:57,710
you've got to be careful about it you

1838
01:13:55,730 --> 01:13:59,870
can't have everything you can have what

1839
01:13:57,710 --> 01:14:01,400
would be good for you but you have to

1840
01:13:59,870 --> 01:14:04,760
figure out what it is and then you have

1841
01:14:01,400 --> 01:14:06,530
to aim at it well my experience with

1842
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:08,180
people as being is if they figure out

1843
01:14:06,530 --> 01:14:10,640
what it is that would be good for them

1844
01:14:08,180 --> 01:14:12,890
and then they aim at it then they get it

1845
01:14:10,640 --> 01:14:18,800
and it's strange because they don't

1846
01:14:12,890 --> 01:14:20,540
necessarily an idea about what would be

1847
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:22,100
good for you and then you take ten steps

1848
01:14:20,540 --> 01:14:23,780
towards that and you find out that your

1849
01:14:22,100 --> 01:14:25,610
formulation was a bit off and so you

1850
01:14:23,780 --> 01:14:27,620
have to reformulate your goal you know

1851
01:14:25,610 --> 01:14:30,350
you're kind of going like this as you

1852
01:14:27,620 --> 01:14:32,210
move towards the goal but a huge part of

1853
01:14:30,350 --> 01:14:35,000
the reason that people fail is because

1854
01:14:32,210 --> 01:14:37,970
they don't ever set up the criteria for

1855
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:39,710
success and so since success is a very

1856
01:14:37,970 --> 01:14:41,150
narrow line and very unlikely the

1857
01:14:39,710 --> 01:14:45,020
probability that you're going to stumble

1858
01:14:41,150 --> 01:14:45,989
on it randomly is zero and so there's a

1859
01:14:45,020 --> 01:14:48,989
proposition here in

1860
01:14:45,989 --> 01:14:53,550
proposition is if you actually want

1861
01:14:48,989 --> 01:14:55,559
something you can have it now the

1862
01:14:53,550 --> 01:14:59,280
question then would be well what do you

1863
01:14:55,559 --> 01:15:02,400
mean by actually want an answer is that

1864
01:14:59,280 --> 01:15:05,670
you reorient your life in every possible

1865
01:15:02,400 --> 01:15:08,550
way to make the probability that that

1866
01:15:05,670 --> 01:15:10,409
will occur as certain as possible and

1867
01:15:08,550 --> 01:15:13,590
that's a sacrificial idea right it's

1868
01:15:10,409 --> 01:15:16,679
like you don't get everything obviously

1869
01:15:13,590 --> 01:15:19,260
you obviously but maybe you can have

1870
01:15:16,679 --> 01:15:23,510
what you need and maybe all you have to

1871
01:15:19,260 --> 01:15:28,110
do to get it is ask but asking isn't a

1872
01:15:23,510 --> 01:15:30,150
whim or today's wish it's like you have

1873
01:15:28,110 --> 01:15:32,190
to be deadly serious about it you have

1874
01:15:30,150 --> 01:15:34,559
to think okay like I'm taking stock of

1875
01:15:32,190 --> 01:15:36,269
myself and if I was going to live

1876
01:15:34,559 --> 01:15:39,900
properly in the world and I was going to

1877
01:15:36,269 --> 01:15:42,900
set myself up such that being would

1878
01:15:39,900 --> 01:15:45,630
justify itself in my estimation and I

1879
01:15:42,900 --> 01:15:48,539
don't mean as a harsh judge exactly what

1880
01:15:45,630 --> 01:15:51,809
is it that I would aim at well one of

1881
01:15:48,539 --> 01:15:56,369
the things I found is that in in tests

1882
01:15:51,809 --> 01:16:00,300
of this theory let's say you could try

1883
01:15:56,369 --> 01:16:02,789
this this is a form of Prayer knocking

1884
01:16:00,300 --> 01:16:07,739
sit on your bed one day and ask yourself

1885
01:16:02,789 --> 01:16:09,690
ah what's what remarkably stupid things

1886
01:16:07,739 --> 01:16:12,780
am i doing on a regular basis to

1887
01:16:09,690 --> 01:16:14,639
absolutely screw up my life and if you

1888
01:16:12,780 --> 01:16:15,840
actually asked that question but you

1889
01:16:14,639 --> 01:16:17,249
have to want to know the answer right

1890
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:18,929
because that's actually what asking the

1891
01:16:17,249 --> 01:16:20,999
question means it doesn't mean just

1892
01:16:18,929 --> 01:16:23,489
mouthing the words it means you have to

1893
01:16:20,999 --> 01:16:24,900
decide that you want to know you'll

1894
01:16:23,489 --> 01:16:29,969
figure that's out so fast it'll make

1895
01:16:24,900 --> 01:16:31,530
your hair curl you'll you it's as if you

1896
01:16:29,969 --> 01:16:33,179
thought about this he thought you know

1897
01:16:31,530 --> 01:16:34,949
he thought that people had two poles of

1898
01:16:33,179 --> 01:16:37,139
consciousness and one was the individual

1899
01:16:34,949 --> 01:16:38,400
consciousness that we each identify with

1900
01:16:37,139 --> 01:16:40,769
in the other was something he called the

1901
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:42,840
self and the self is the you might think

1902
01:16:40,769 --> 01:16:45,360
about it as the divine within that's

1903
01:16:42,840 --> 01:16:46,949
close enough approximation and to the

1904
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:49,230
universal part of your consciousness

1905
01:16:46,949 --> 01:16:51,360
it's your conscience that's another way

1906
01:16:49,230 --> 01:16:53,070
of thinking about it whatever your

1907
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:55,019
conscience is but it's something that

1908
01:16:53,070 --> 01:16:57,840
you can consult it's like the Socratic

1909
01:16:55,019 --> 01:16:59,080
Damon Socrates said that the thing that

1910
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:01,750
made him different than every

1911
01:16:59,080 --> 01:17:05,380
in Greece was that he consulted his

1912
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:07,240
Damon his genius he asked himself how it

1913
01:17:05,380 --> 01:17:08,830
was that he should conduct himself in

1914
01:17:07,240 --> 01:17:11,350
the world and then he did that

1915
01:17:08,830 --> 01:17:13,360
whatever it was he didn't try to force a

1916
01:17:11,350 --> 01:17:16,480
solution you know he didn't try to force

1917
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:18,610
a solution selfishly he asked I'm going

1918
01:17:16,480 --> 01:17:20,170
to manifest myself in the best possible

1919
01:17:18,610 --> 01:17:23,560
manner in the world I would like to do

1920
01:17:20,170 --> 01:17:26,080
that what would that be well you're

1921
01:17:23,560 --> 01:17:29,010
perfectly capable of thinking god only

1922
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:32,410
knows how you're perfectly capable of

1923
01:17:29,010 --> 01:17:34,690
men speeds of imagination and and dream

1924
01:17:32,410 --> 01:17:36,250
and fantasies god only knows how you do

1925
01:17:34,690 --> 01:17:37,720
all of that what would happen if you

1926
01:17:36,250 --> 01:17:40,240
consulted yourself about the best

1927
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:42,130
possible outcome for you you might get

1928
01:17:40,240 --> 01:17:50,740
an answer well that's what this

1929
01:17:42,130 --> 01:17:52,990
proposition is or what man is there of

1930
01:17:50,740 --> 01:17:54,700
you whom if his son asks for bread we'll

1931
01:17:52,990 --> 01:17:57,520
give him a stone or if he asks for a

1932
01:17:54,700 --> 01:17:59,620
fish will give him a serpent if ye then

1933
01:17:57,520 --> 01:18:01,450
being evil know how to give good gifts

1934
01:17:59,620 --> 01:18:03,400
unto your children how much more shall

1935
01:18:01,450 --> 01:18:06,970
your father which is in heaven give good

1936
01:18:03,400 --> 01:18:08,560
things to them that ask him well this is

1937
01:18:06,970 --> 01:18:12,360
a question about the fundamental nature

1938
01:18:08,560 --> 01:18:15,940
of being I suppose and one of the

1939
01:18:12,360 --> 01:18:19,120
hypotheses in the New Testament which is

1940
01:18:15,940 --> 01:18:20,500
different to different hypotheses in

1941
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:26,170
some sense than the one that structures

1942
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:29,950
the Old Testament is that faith makes

1943
01:18:26,170 --> 01:18:31,870
being good it's a very interesting

1944
01:18:29,950 --> 01:18:34,270
proposition and so the notion would be

1945
01:18:31,870 --> 01:18:37,540
and it's an action-oriented issue as

1946
01:18:34,270 --> 01:18:39,730
well you act out the proposition that if

1947
01:18:37,540 --> 01:18:41,730
you act properly in the world that being

1948
01:18:39,730 --> 01:18:44,620
will reveal itself to you as benevolent

1949
01:18:41,730 --> 01:18:47,110
but you will not know you'll never know

1950
01:18:44,620 --> 01:18:50,860
unless you do it so this is a call to

1951
01:18:47,110 --> 01:18:53,290
that act out the proposition that if you

1952
01:18:50,860 --> 01:18:55,650
act properly that being itself is

1953
01:18:53,290 --> 01:18:55,650
benevolent

1954
01:19:01,420 --> 01:19:05,730
no reason to assume the contrary I mean

1955
01:19:03,850 --> 01:19:08,290
to assume the contrary would be to be as

1956
01:19:05,730 --> 01:19:09,699
cynical and bitter as possible and it's

1957
01:19:08,290 --> 01:19:11,530
not like we don't have reason for that

1958
01:19:09,699 --> 01:19:16,030
it's not like I don't understand why

1959
01:19:11,530 --> 01:19:18,820
that happens to people therefore all

1960
01:19:16,030 --> 01:19:21,489
things whatsoever you would that men

1961
01:19:18,820 --> 01:19:23,830
should do to you do you even so to them

1962
01:19:21,489 --> 01:19:26,530
for this is the law and the prophets

1963
01:19:23,830 --> 01:19:29,110
and that's a reciprocity issue right

1964
01:19:26,530 --> 01:19:30,460
it's like well imagine what would be

1965
01:19:29,110 --> 01:19:32,110
this is another thing I learned from

1966
01:19:30,460 --> 01:19:34,630
Jung because as Jung reversed this

1967
01:19:32,110 --> 01:19:36,850
because this is often read it's it's the

1968
01:19:34,630 --> 01:19:38,770
golden rule it's often read as be nice

1969
01:19:36,850 --> 01:19:40,449
to it be nice to other people it's like

1970
01:19:38,770 --> 01:19:42,550
that is not what this rule means it

1971
01:19:40,449 --> 01:19:46,480
doesn't mean that even a little bit it

1972
01:19:42,550 --> 01:19:48,340
means something like and we'll reverse

1973
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:49,690
it so that will concentrate on you

1974
01:19:48,340 --> 01:19:52,890
rather than the other person to begin

1975
01:19:49,690 --> 01:19:52,890
with it means something like

1976
01:19:53,640 --> 01:19:59,050
conceptualize how things could be great

1977
01:19:56,469 --> 01:20:01,660
if they were great for you if you were

1978
01:19:59,050 --> 01:20:04,810
taking care of yourself and then work to

1979
01:20:01,660 --> 01:20:06,340
make that the case for everyone else you

1980
01:20:04,810 --> 01:20:09,190
know you see that in Buddhism because

1981
01:20:06,340 --> 01:20:12,670
Buddha reached Nirvana right that's the

1982
01:20:09,190 --> 01:20:15,280
theory and then he was tempted with the

1983
01:20:12,670 --> 01:20:17,850
offer to stay there and he rejected that

1984
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:20,530
offer and came back to the profane world

1985
01:20:17,850 --> 01:20:23,590
because he felt that the attainment of

1986
01:20:20,530 --> 01:20:26,170
Nirvana was insufficient unless everyone

1987
01:20:23,590 --> 01:20:30,100
attained it simultaneously and so it's

1988
01:20:26,170 --> 01:20:32,679
something like that but it's treat

1989
01:20:30,100 --> 01:20:36,600
yourself properly that's a hard thing to

1990
01:20:32,679 --> 01:20:42,340
do because you're a fallen shameful

1991
01:20:36,600 --> 01:20:45,190
cowardly deceitful malevolent mortal

1992
01:20:42,340 --> 01:20:46,750
creature and so it's not easy and you

1993
01:20:45,190 --> 01:20:50,590
know it and it's not easy to treat

1994
01:20:46,750 --> 01:20:52,420
something like that properly and and it

1995
01:20:50,590 --> 01:20:53,770
isn't obvious that people treat

1996
01:20:52,420 --> 01:20:55,090
themselves better than they treat other

1997
01:20:53,770 --> 01:20:56,650
people I don't think that's obvious at

1998
01:20:55,090 --> 01:20:58,330
all but maybe you could start with

1999
01:20:56,650 --> 01:21:00,690
yourself and think okay I'm going to

2000
01:20:58,330 --> 01:21:03,160
take care of myself as if I have value

2001
01:21:00,690 --> 01:21:04,900
what would that look like and then I'm

2002
01:21:03,160 --> 01:21:08,260
going to work to extend that courtesy to

2003
01:21:04,900 --> 01:21:11,230
everyone else and that's well the

2004
01:21:08,260 --> 01:21:14,980
hypothesis here is that if you take all

2005
01:21:11,230 --> 01:21:18,330
of the moral wisdom that mankind has

2006
01:21:14,980 --> 01:21:21,580
generated over its millennia of struggle

2007
01:21:18,330 --> 01:21:25,170
evolved and then manifested metaphors

2008
01:21:21,580 --> 01:21:27,720
story and then codified into law

2009
01:21:25,170 --> 01:21:30,100
articulated law and you pick one

2010
01:21:27,720 --> 01:21:36,760
principle that dominated all of that

2011
01:21:30,100 --> 01:21:38,170
this would be the principle and it's

2012
01:21:36,760 --> 01:21:41,110
interesting too because it's the law and

2013
01:21:38,170 --> 01:21:42,790
the prophets and the law is the rules

2014
01:21:41,110 --> 01:21:44,920
but the prophets are the process by

2015
01:21:42,790 --> 01:21:46,780
which the rules are being updated right

2016
01:21:44,920 --> 01:21:49,000
and so the prophets are superordinate in

2017
01:21:46,780 --> 01:21:50,590
some sense to the law and the

2018
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:53,290
proposition that's set forth in this

2019
01:21:50,590 --> 01:21:56,290
particular statement is that this maxim

2020
01:21:53,290 --> 01:21:58,510
which is optimize your own mode of being

2021
01:21:56,290 --> 01:22:01,180
and then work to do the same for

2022
01:21:58,510 --> 01:22:02,800
everyone around you is not only the

2023
01:22:01,180 --> 01:22:04,300
thing that's at the core of the law but

2024
01:22:02,800 --> 01:22:09,820
it's at the core of the process that

2025
01:22:04,300 --> 01:22:13,360
generates and updates the law to hell of

2026
01:22:09,820 --> 01:22:15,310
a thing for someone to say enter ye in

2027
01:22:13,360 --> 01:22:16,989
at the narrow gate because that's what

2028
01:22:15,310 --> 01:22:18,820
Strait means enter ye and at the

2029
01:22:16,989 --> 01:22:20,140
straight gate for wide is the gate and

2030
01:22:18,820 --> 01:22:22,000
broad is the way that leadeth to

2031
01:22:20,140 --> 01:22:24,370
destruction well who in the world could

2032
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:25,690
possibly argue with that everyone in the

2033
01:22:24,370 --> 01:22:27,760
right mind knows that there's a million

2034
01:22:25,690 --> 01:22:29,560
ways of doing things wrong and one way

2035
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:32,350
if you're lucky to do things right and

2036
01:22:29,560 --> 01:22:34,720
so the notion that it's a very very

2037
01:22:32,350 --> 01:22:36,760
narrow pathway that you tread upon if

2038
01:22:34,720 --> 01:22:40,870
you're doing things right that's that's

2039
01:22:36,760 --> 01:22:42,370
wisdom that's the line between chaos and

2040
01:22:40,870 --> 01:22:44,590
order that you're supposed to be on

2041
01:22:42,370 --> 01:22:45,970
constantly right it's a very very thin

2042
01:22:44,590 --> 01:22:47,950
line because if you're a little bit too

2043
01:22:45,970 --> 01:22:49,390
far in one direction then it's too much

2044
01:22:47,950 --> 01:22:50,560
chaos and if you're a little too far in

2045
01:22:49,390 --> 01:22:52,540
the other direction then it's too much

2046
01:22:50,560 --> 01:22:54,220
order and both of those aren't good it

2047
01:22:52,540 --> 01:22:56,800
has did the balance have to be exactly

2048
01:22:54,220 --> 01:22:58,239
right and you can feel that and I truly

2049
01:22:56,800 --> 01:23:00,280
believe you can feel that and I think

2050
01:22:58,239 --> 01:23:02,290
it's your deepest instinct it's your

2051
01:23:00,280 --> 01:23:04,270
deepest instinct and I mean that I mean

2052
01:23:02,290 --> 01:23:06,489
that biologically I don't mean that

2053
01:23:04,270 --> 01:23:09,460
metaphorically I think that your psyche

2054
01:23:06,489 --> 01:23:12,400
is arranged to exist in a cosmos that's

2055
01:23:09,460 --> 01:23:13,570
composed of chaos and order I think

2056
01:23:12,400 --> 01:23:15,880
that's why you have the hemispheric

2057
01:23:13,570 --> 01:23:18,910
structure that you have this is deeper

2058
01:23:15,880 --> 01:23:21,310
than metaphor and then when you feel as

2059
01:23:18,910 --> 01:23:23,980
if you're meaningfully engaged in the

2060
01:23:21,310 --> 01:23:27,040
world when the terror of your mortality

2061
01:23:23,980 --> 01:23:28,570
strips away and you're engaged and it's

2062
01:23:27,040 --> 01:23:30,480
timeless

2063
01:23:28,570 --> 01:23:33,010
that's the deepest instinct you have

2064
01:23:30,480 --> 01:23:35,320
telling you that you're in the right

2065
01:23:33,010 --> 01:23:37,840
place at the right time and then what

2066
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:39,880
you do is practice being there practice

2067
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:42,099
being there and that's that that narrow

2068
01:23:39,880 --> 01:23:43,690
spot is so difficult to find you wander

2069
01:23:42,099 --> 01:23:45,429
around it maybe if you're lucky you can

2070
01:23:43,690 --> 01:23:46,179
watch you can watch this as an

2071
01:23:45,429 --> 01:23:48,520
experiment

2072
01:23:46,179 --> 01:23:50,079
watch yourself for two weeks like you

2073
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:51,880
don't know who you are because you don't

2074
01:23:50,079 --> 01:23:53,199
so watch yourself for two weeks and

2075
01:23:51,880 --> 01:23:55,750
notice there's going to be times when

2076
01:23:53,199 --> 01:23:58,150
things are proper their raid properly

2077
01:23:55,750 --> 01:23:59,409
for you yeah it's not easy to notice

2078
01:23:58,150 --> 01:24:01,000
because when they're arrayed like that

2079
01:23:59,409 --> 01:24:03,400
you're so engaged you don't exactly

2080
01:24:01,000 --> 01:24:05,650
notice you know but you'll see oh I'm in

2081
01:24:03,400 --> 01:24:08,860
the right place it's like okay how did I

2082
01:24:05,650 --> 01:24:10,630
get here what am i doing right you know

2083
01:24:08,860 --> 01:24:12,369
how is it that this could happen more

2084
01:24:10,630 --> 01:24:13,750
often I'd like this to happen more often

2085
01:24:12,369 --> 01:24:15,610
how would I have to conduct myself in

2086
01:24:13,750 --> 01:24:17,380
order for that to happen more often and

2087
01:24:15,610 --> 01:24:19,599
then you practice that and then maybe

2088
01:24:17,380 --> 01:24:21,639
instead of ten minutes a month or ten

2089
01:24:19,599 --> 01:24:23,199
minutes a week it's like 15 minutes a

2090
01:24:21,639 --> 01:24:24,520
day and then it's half an hour a day and

2091
01:24:23,199 --> 01:24:26,560
then it's an hour a day and then it's

2092
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:28,480
four hours a day and maybe if you if

2093
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:30,599
you're extraordinarily careful then you

2094
01:24:28,480 --> 01:24:35,619
get to a point where you're like that a

2095
01:24:30,599 --> 01:24:37,389
good proportion of the time because

2096
01:24:35,619 --> 01:24:39,099
Strait is the gate and narrow is the way

2097
01:24:37,389 --> 01:24:44,349
which leadeth unto life and few there be

2098
01:24:39,099 --> 01:24:45,610
that find it beware of false prophets

2099
01:24:44,349 --> 01:24:47,730
which come to you in sheep's clothing

2100
01:24:45,610 --> 01:24:50,020
but inwardly they are ravening wolves

2101
01:24:47,730 --> 01:24:51,790
that's particularly good advice for

2102
01:24:50,020 --> 01:24:56,369
today's political situation I can tell

2103
01:24:51,790 --> 01:24:58,960
you you shall know them by their fruits

2104
01:24:56,369 --> 01:25:02,320
do men gather grapes of thorns or figs

2105
01:24:58,960 --> 01:25:03,909
of thistles even so every good tree

2106
01:25:02,320 --> 01:25:08,230
bringeth forth good fruit but a corrupt

2107
01:25:03,909 --> 01:25:10,210
tree bringeth forth evil fruit well

2108
01:25:08,230 --> 01:25:12,250
that's what I learned from studying the

2109
01:25:10,210 --> 01:25:14,770
history of totalitarianism in the 20th

2110
01:25:12,250 --> 01:25:19,889
century is that a corrupt tree brings

2111
01:25:14,770 --> 01:25:25,270
forth evil fruit and that's for sure and

2112
01:25:19,889 --> 01:25:26,170
so funny you know people who think when

2113
01:25:25,270 --> 01:25:28,090
they're thinking about the relationship

2114
01:25:26,170 --> 01:25:31,239
with divinity or the relationship with

2115
01:25:28,090 --> 01:25:32,949
God they think it's a primitive and

2116
01:25:31,239 --> 01:25:34,510
childish way of thinking what if a

2117
01:25:32,949 --> 01:25:36,639
miracle just manifests why can't a

2118
01:25:34,510 --> 01:25:38,469
miracle just manifest itself and I would

2119
01:25:36,639 --> 01:25:39,849
be convinced and the funny thing is is

2120
01:25:38,469 --> 01:25:41,829
first of all actually you wouldn't be if

2121
01:25:39,849 --> 01:25:42,640
a miracle actually happened you would

2122
01:25:41,829 --> 01:25:44,890
actually forget about

2123
01:25:42,640 --> 01:25:46,300
about six months that's I mean you'd

2124
01:25:44,890 --> 01:25:47,800
think that's not true but it's true you

2125
01:25:46,300 --> 01:25:50,020
would actually forget about it because

2126
01:25:47,800 --> 01:25:51,490
that's what people are like but there

2127
01:25:50,020 --> 01:25:53,500
are negative miracles that are happening

2128
01:25:51,490 --> 01:25:55,390
all the time which actually lend some

2129
01:25:53,500 --> 01:25:57,100
credence to my supposition and we don't

2130
01:25:55,390 --> 01:25:58,690
pay any attention to that if we can't

2131
01:25:57,100 --> 01:26:00,700
learn from what happened in the 20th

2132
01:25:58,690 --> 01:26:03,580
century then we are absolutely incapable

2133
01:26:00,700 --> 01:26:05,890
of learning because what happened in the

2134
01:26:03,580 --> 01:26:08,260
20th century was as bitter a set of

2135
01:26:05,890 --> 01:26:11,200
lessons as you could possibly imagine

2136
01:26:08,260 --> 01:26:13,930
and its associated precisely with this a

2137
01:26:11,200 --> 01:26:15,730
corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit a

2138
01:26:13,930 --> 01:26:17,620
good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit

2139
01:26:15,730 --> 01:26:23,800
neither can a corrupt tree bring forth

2140
01:26:17,620 --> 01:26:26,740
good fruit every tree that bringeth

2141
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:28,660
forth that bringeth not forth good few

2142
01:26:26,740 --> 01:26:30,820
fruit is hewn down and cast into the

2143
01:26:28,660 --> 01:26:34,000
fire well that's a flood motif right

2144
01:26:30,820 --> 01:26:35,890
there it's like we're constantly the

2145
01:26:34,000 --> 01:26:38,620
archetype of the tree that's the

2146
01:26:35,890 --> 01:26:44,620
archetype of being it's the archetype of

2147
01:26:38,620 --> 01:26:47,770
the self often what's the warning here

2148
01:26:44,620 --> 01:26:49,930
that if you're mostly deadwood you're

2149
01:26:47,770 --> 01:26:52,060
going to get you're going to burn up and

2150
01:26:49,930 --> 01:26:54,280
you can think about that metaphysically

2151
01:26:52,060 --> 01:26:55,870
you can you can project that into

2152
01:26:54,280 --> 01:26:57,970
eternity and you can think about that as

2153
01:26:55,870 --> 01:26:59,920
a form of Hell and the funny thing is is

2154
01:26:57,970 --> 01:27:03,280
that when that's happening to you in

2155
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:05,260
real time it is like an eternity in hell

2156
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:06,940
it's a perfectly reasonable way of

2157
01:27:05,260 --> 01:27:08,710
thinking about it but you can strip the

2158
01:27:06,940 --> 01:27:11,860
metaphysical elements off and you can

2159
01:27:08,710 --> 01:27:14,230
say well if you're mostly dead wood then

2160
01:27:11,860 --> 01:27:16,450
a spark will light you on fire and

2161
01:27:14,230 --> 01:27:19,210
that's also very much worth thinking

2162
01:27:16,450 --> 01:27:21,820
about wherefore by their fruits shall

2163
01:27:19,210 --> 01:27:24,970
you know them not everyone that saith

2164
01:27:21,820 --> 01:27:26,500
unto me Lord shall enter the kingdom of

2165
01:27:24,970 --> 01:27:28,920
heaven but he that doeth the will of my

2166
01:27:26,500 --> 01:27:32,650
father which is in heaven

2167
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:35,740
that's an interesting line I think I

2168
01:27:32,650 --> 01:27:37,480
mean one of the proper critiques of

2169
01:27:35,740 --> 01:27:38,800
traditional Christianity maybe this is

2170
01:27:37,480 --> 01:27:42,340
the sort of critique that Nietzsche put

2171
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:44,830
forth was that Christianity had

2172
01:27:42,340 --> 01:27:46,600
degenerated in its moral mission Jung

2173
01:27:44,830 --> 01:27:47,740
was a little bit more sympathetic and

2174
01:27:46,600 --> 01:27:50,110
I'll tell you why in a minute but

2175
01:27:47,740 --> 01:27:53,890
Nietzsche's idea was that Christianity

2176
01:27:50,110 --> 01:27:55,850
had lost its way when it generated the

2177
01:27:53,890 --> 01:27:59,840
presupposition that human

2178
01:27:55,850 --> 01:28:02,540
nnedi was saved in some final sense by

2179
01:27:59,840 --> 01:28:05,300
the sacrifice of Christ it meant that

2180
01:28:02,540 --> 01:28:09,440
the work was already done and that and

2181
01:28:05,300 --> 01:28:12,050
I'm I'm being I'm being harsh in my

2182
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:15,320
judgment for the purpose of rhetorical

2183
01:28:12,050 --> 01:28:17,480
simplification but the idea was that if

2184
01:28:15,320 --> 01:28:20,540
you just professed faith that that had

2185
01:28:17,480 --> 01:28:23,900
already occurred then you were granted

2186
01:28:20,540 --> 01:28:25,730
eternal salvation it's like well it's

2187
01:28:23,900 --> 01:28:26,630
not so straightforward and I think that

2188
01:28:25,730 --> 01:28:31,190
that's what this line actually

2189
01:28:26,630 --> 01:28:34,040
represents it says how you enter into

2190
01:28:31,190 --> 01:28:37,010
the kingdom of heaven and and again you

2191
01:28:34,040 --> 01:28:38,390
can think about that under the aspect of

2192
01:28:37,010 --> 01:28:40,640
eternity or you can think about it as a

2193
01:28:38,390 --> 01:28:46,040
psychological statement and the answer

2194
01:28:40,640 --> 01:28:48,800
is quite straightforward is that you do

2195
01:28:46,040 --> 01:28:51,380
what Noah did to make him immune from

2196
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:54,100
the flood and that's to walk with God

2197
01:28:51,380 --> 01:28:56,930
and that's what this sermon is about

2198
01:28:54,100 --> 01:29:01,090
it's laying out the practical elements

2199
01:28:56,930 --> 01:29:04,330
of that and the practical elements are

2200
01:29:01,090 --> 01:29:08,690
aimed at the highest possible good and

2201
01:29:04,330 --> 01:29:11,000
play that out in the world and then you

2202
01:29:08,690 --> 01:29:12,610
may have the opportunity to inhabit the

2203
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:17,060
highest possible good that you're

2204
01:29:12,610 --> 01:29:18,680
positing into existence perhaps not but

2205
01:29:17,060 --> 01:29:20,450
you can't think of any more practical

2206
01:29:18,680 --> 01:29:22,070
way of going about that I mean if you

2207
01:29:20,450 --> 01:29:23,300
build a house then maybe you can live in

2208
01:29:22,070 --> 01:29:24,500
it if you don't build a house you're not

2209
01:29:23,300 --> 01:29:26,240
going to be able to live in it if you

2210
01:29:24,500 --> 01:29:28,130
build a good house then you'll be able

2211
01:29:26,240 --> 01:29:29,510
to live in a good house and if you build

2212
01:29:28,130 --> 01:29:31,880
a perfect house then maybe you can live

2213
01:29:29,510 --> 01:29:33,590
in a perfect house but if you just say

2214
01:29:31,880 --> 01:29:36,440
that the house has already been built

2215
01:29:33,590 --> 01:29:38,690
for you and that you can just say that

2216
01:29:36,440 --> 01:29:40,760
the house is being built for you well

2217
01:29:38,690 --> 01:29:42,290
then the probability that you're going

2218
01:29:40,760 --> 01:29:44,540
to be able to live where you need to

2219
01:29:42,290 --> 01:29:45,470
live is there's no probability that

2220
01:29:44,540 --> 01:29:47,750
you're going to be able to live where

2221
01:29:45,470 --> 01:29:49,610
you need to live many will say to me in

2222
01:29:47,750 --> 01:29:51,530
that day that's the Judgment Day Lord

2223
01:29:49,610 --> 01:29:53,390
have we not prophesied in thy name and

2224
01:29:51,530 --> 01:29:55,220
in thy name of cast out devils and in

2225
01:29:53,390 --> 01:29:57,530
thy name done many wonderful works and

2226
01:29:55,220 --> 01:30:01,220
then I will profess unto them I never

2227
01:29:57,530 --> 01:30:03,580
knew you depart from me you that work

2228
01:30:01,220 --> 01:30:08,450
iniquity

2229
01:30:03,580 --> 01:30:09,920
see that's Judgment Day you know that's

2230
01:30:08,450 --> 01:30:11,330
an archetypal idea

2231
01:30:09,920 --> 01:30:14,420
and partly it's archetypal because

2232
01:30:11,330 --> 01:30:17,660
everyday is Judgment Day and the part of

2233
01:30:14,420 --> 01:30:19,730
you that the part of you that's

2234
01:30:17,660 --> 01:30:22,850
equivalent to the logo say the part of

2235
01:30:19,730 --> 01:30:26,290
you that's your own ideal sits in

2236
01:30:22,850 --> 01:30:28,880
eternal judgment on your iniquity and

2237
01:30:26,290 --> 01:30:32,210
that's the con that's the source of

2238
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:36,380
guilt and shame and and and withdrawal

2239
01:30:32,210 --> 01:30:41,290
and then resentment and then murderous

2240
01:30:36,380 --> 01:30:44,090
'no sand then genocide it's because you

2241
01:30:41,290 --> 01:30:45,710
can intuit the ideal and the problem

2242
01:30:44,090 --> 01:30:48,890
with intuiting the ideal is that an

2243
01:30:45,710 --> 01:30:50,239
ideal is always a judge there's no

2244
01:30:48,890 --> 01:30:52,190
difference between an ideal and the

2245
01:30:50,239 --> 01:30:53,929
judge and so you're eternally judged by

2246
01:30:52,190 --> 01:30:55,429
your own ideal if you have no idea well

2247
01:30:53,929 --> 01:30:57,230
then you've got no direction and no

2248
01:30:55,429 --> 01:31:00,110
meaning in your life and then of course

2249
01:30:57,230 --> 01:31:02,630
the more extremely ideal the harsher the

2250
01:31:00,110 --> 01:31:04,760
judge that's actually why young young

2251
01:31:02,630 --> 01:31:06,650
was very curious about why the book of

2252
01:31:04,760 --> 01:31:08,900
Revelation was tacked on to the Bible to

2253
01:31:06,650 --> 01:31:12,440
the book of Revelation that's a very

2254
01:31:08,900 --> 01:31:14,480
weird book and you know in in in the

2255
01:31:12,440 --> 01:31:18,020
Gospels Christ is I would say perhaps

2256
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:20,179
primarily merciful there's a maybe a war

2257
01:31:18,020 --> 01:31:22,340
in his character between truth and mercy

2258
01:31:20,179 --> 01:31:25,130
but it's one of the two perhaps mercy

2259
01:31:22,340 --> 01:31:27,410
and Jung's observation was the gospel

2260
01:31:25,130 --> 01:31:28,880
Christ was too merciful and that's why

2261
01:31:27,410 --> 01:31:31,489
the book of Revelation was tapped on

2262
01:31:28,880 --> 01:31:33,860
tacked onto the New Testament because in

2263
01:31:31,489 --> 01:31:36,140
the book of Revelation Christ who's the

2264
01:31:33,860 --> 01:31:38,449
ideal who's above the pyramid right the

2265
01:31:36,140 --> 01:31:41,719
transcendent ideal is nothing but a

2266
01:31:38,449 --> 01:31:43,850
judge and everyone fails and of course

2267
01:31:41,719 --> 01:31:46,070
the ultimate ideal is the ultimate judge

2268
01:31:43,850 --> 01:31:47,239
and so that's the archetypal reality

2269
01:31:46,070 --> 01:31:48,920
there and you can say well I don't want

2270
01:31:47,239 --> 01:31:51,080
to be judged and so I'll dispense with

2271
01:31:48,920 --> 01:31:53,090
the ideal but then you're Cain because

2272
01:31:51,080 --> 01:31:55,370
Cain is exactly the person who dispenses

2273
01:31:53,090 --> 01:31:57,620
with the ideal and so there's no

2274
01:31:55,370 --> 01:31:59,989
escaping from it there's no escaping

2275
01:31:57,620 --> 01:32:04,070
from eternal judgment that's the

2276
01:31:59,989 --> 01:32:05,510
archetypal story you know people put a

2277
01:32:04,070 --> 01:32:08,000
lot of work into these representations

2278
01:32:05,510 --> 01:32:09,650
you know and there's thousands of them

2279
01:32:08,000 --> 01:32:13,010
they weren't messing around

2280
01:32:09,650 --> 01:32:14,420
these are serious pieces of work you

2281
01:32:13,010 --> 01:32:16,340
know we don't understand them but that

2282
01:32:14,420 --> 01:32:17,780
doesn't mean that the people who created

2283
01:32:16,340 --> 01:32:20,000
them didn't know what they were doing

2284
01:32:17,780 --> 01:32:21,620
these were geniuses who created these

2285
01:32:20,000 --> 01:32:23,750
pieces of work it's not like they

2286
01:32:21,620 --> 01:32:26,240
understood in an articulated manner

2287
01:32:23,750 --> 01:32:27,980
what they were trying to represent but

2288
01:32:26,240 --> 01:32:29,960
what they were representing were the the

2289
01:32:27,980 --> 01:32:31,460
metaphor is at the core of our culture

2290
01:32:29,960 --> 01:32:33,830
to the degree that our culture is

2291
01:32:31,460 --> 01:32:37,180
functional and good these are the

2292
01:32:33,830 --> 01:32:39,650
metaphors upon which it's founded and

2293
01:32:37,180 --> 01:32:41,930
they're not for the faint of heart you

2294
01:32:39,650 --> 01:32:43,460
know you say religion is the opiate of

2295
01:32:41,930 --> 01:32:46,010
the masses it's like yeah then how do

2296
01:32:43,460 --> 01:32:47,840
you explain this exactly you know

2297
01:32:46,010 --> 01:32:51,550
because if it was opiates you're after

2298
01:32:47,840 --> 01:32:51,550
you might just get rid of that panel

2299
01:32:53,710 --> 01:32:57,620
especially when the other thing that's

2300
01:32:56,030 --> 01:32:59,750
so interesting about the proposition if

2301
01:32:57,620 --> 01:33:02,810
you look at revelations in Revelation

2302
01:32:59,750 --> 01:33:05,330
and you look at the judgment almost

2303
01:33:02,810 --> 01:33:08,090
everyone ends up on the right side of

2304
01:33:05,330 --> 01:33:09,680
this panel so if you are just conjuring

2305
01:33:08,090 --> 01:33:12,310
up some sort of pathetic wish

2306
01:33:09,680 --> 01:33:16,520
fulfillment why in the world would you

2307
01:33:12,310 --> 01:33:17,810
tilt the scales in that manner you think

2308
01:33:16,520 --> 01:33:19,370
that's supposed to make people feel good

2309
01:33:17,810 --> 01:33:20,960
I don't think so

2310
01:33:19,370 --> 01:33:23,570
there's almost nothing about this

2311
01:33:20,960 --> 01:33:25,970
picture that should make people feel

2312
01:33:23,570 --> 01:33:27,800
good it should if you understand it

2313
01:33:25,970 --> 01:33:29,690
properly it should terrify you to the

2314
01:33:27,800 --> 01:33:33,740
depths of your soul that's what the

2315
01:33:29,690 --> 01:33:35,360
picture is for therefore whoever heareth

2316
01:33:33,740 --> 01:33:37,310
these sayings of mine and doeth them I

2317
01:33:35,360 --> 01:33:39,380
will liken him unto a wise man which

2318
01:33:37,310 --> 01:33:41,930
built his house upon a rock and the rain

2319
01:33:39,380 --> 01:33:43,760
descended and the winds blew and the

2320
01:33:41,930 --> 01:33:46,340
floods came and beat upon the house and

2321
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:50,780
it fell not for it was founded upon a

2322
01:33:46,340 --> 01:33:52,130
rock and every one that heareth these

2323
01:33:50,780 --> 01:33:53,990
sayings of mine and doeth them not shall

2324
01:33:52,130 --> 01:33:55,880
be likened unto a foolish man which

2325
01:33:53,990 --> 01:33:57,470
built his house upon the sand and the

2326
01:33:55,880 --> 01:34:00,110
rain descended and the floods came and

2327
01:33:57,470 --> 01:34:04,310
the winds blew had beat upon that house

2328
01:34:00,110 --> 01:34:09,530
and it oh I made a mistake and it fell

2329
01:34:04,310 --> 01:34:11,360
for it was founded upon the sand and it

2330
01:34:09,530 --> 01:34:14,420
came to pass this is a very interesting

2331
01:34:11,360 --> 01:34:18,200
line I really I really you know now and

2332
01:34:14,420 --> 01:34:19,940
then you run across lines in this

2333
01:34:18,200 --> 01:34:21,650
particularly happens in biblical

2334
01:34:19,940 --> 01:34:24,620
settings you run across lines that you

2335
01:34:21,650 --> 01:34:27,110
cannot believe actually exist you cannot

2336
01:34:24,620 --> 01:34:29,120
imagine how someone could have imagined

2337
01:34:27,110 --> 01:34:30,620
up and conjured up the line and these

2338
01:34:29,120 --> 01:34:32,480
two lines are like that as far as I'm

2339
01:34:30,620 --> 01:34:34,340
concerned and it came to pass when Jesus

2340
01:34:32,480 --> 01:34:36,410
had ended these sayings that people were

2341
01:34:34,340 --> 01:34:37,630
astonished at his doctrine for he taught

2342
01:34:36,410 --> 01:34:39,550
them as one having a

2343
01:34:37,630 --> 01:34:41,889
authority and not as the scribes and

2344
01:34:39,550 --> 01:34:42,969
that's something so interesting you know

2345
01:34:41,889 --> 01:34:44,800
because that was another thing that

2346
01:34:42,969 --> 01:34:46,659
really I didn't really appreciate about

2347
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:49,360
the churches that I attended to and that

2348
01:34:46,659 --> 01:34:52,389
would be that the lessons were taught by

2349
01:34:49,360 --> 01:34:55,000
scribes and the words were mouthed but

2350
01:34:52,389 --> 01:34:58,330
there was no power in them there was no

2351
01:34:55,000 --> 01:35:00,190
meaning in them it was it was as if well

2352
01:34:58,330 --> 01:35:01,480
it was like when I was 20 years old and

2353
01:35:00,190 --> 01:35:02,949
I was saying all these things I didn't

2354
01:35:01,480 --> 01:35:05,710
mean you know they were words that

2355
01:35:02,949 --> 01:35:07,719
sounded good they were like like gilded

2356
01:35:05,710 --> 01:35:09,219
cloth I suppose that you can that you

2357
01:35:07,719 --> 01:35:11,469
can wrap around yourself but there's no

2358
01:35:09,219 --> 01:35:13,270
substance to them and there's a big

2359
01:35:11,469 --> 01:35:15,070
difference between listening to

2360
01:35:13,270 --> 01:35:17,560
something that has substance and

2361
01:35:15,070 --> 01:35:19,690
listening to something that is spoken

2362
01:35:17,560 --> 01:35:22,750
because it sounds like it should sound

2363
01:35:19,690 --> 01:35:25,139
good and this line says that whoever

2364
01:35:22,750 --> 01:35:28,630
spoke the lines that we just described

2365
01:35:25,139 --> 01:35:30,639
was someone who sounded like he knew

2366
01:35:28,630 --> 01:35:32,949
what he was talking about and not

2367
01:35:30,639 --> 01:35:35,500
someone who was just repeating something

2368
01:35:32,949 --> 01:35:37,210
for the sake of sounding good and it

2369
01:35:35,500 --> 01:35:41,909
certainly seems to me that the lines

2370
01:35:37,210 --> 01:35:49,810
that we just reviewed have the awesome

2371
01:35:41,909 --> 01:35:51,489
impact of authority back to Noah but

2372
01:35:49,810 --> 01:35:54,100
Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord

2373
01:35:51,489 --> 01:35:56,020
these are the generations of Noah Noah

2374
01:35:54,100 --> 01:35:58,030
was a just man and perfect in his

2375
01:35:56,020 --> 01:36:00,310
generations and Noah walked with God and

2376
01:35:58,030 --> 01:36:01,420
Noah begat three sons Shem ham and

2377
01:36:00,310 --> 01:36:03,969
Japheth

2378
01:36:01,420 --> 01:36:05,679
the earth was also corrupt before God

2379
01:36:03,969 --> 01:36:09,159
and the earth was full of violence

2380
01:36:05,679 --> 01:36:12,070
filled with violence any of you see the

2381
01:36:09,159 --> 01:36:18,300
new NRA ad you might want to look that

2382
01:36:12,070 --> 01:36:20,080
up I would say that's the most shocking

2383
01:36:18,300 --> 01:36:22,210
manifestation of political polarization

2384
01:36:20,080 --> 01:36:24,610
in the United States that I've yet seen

2385
01:36:22,210 --> 01:36:27,100
most of it I've seen on the left/right

2386
01:36:24,610 --> 01:36:30,489
the real what shocked me mostly has been

2387
01:36:27,100 --> 01:36:33,250
on the left but the new NRA ad that's a

2388
01:36:30,489 --> 01:36:35,830
whole new thing so it's this attractive

2389
01:36:33,250 --> 01:36:37,540
woman and doing a voiceover she kind of

2390
01:36:35,830 --> 01:36:39,310
looks like Demi Moore well she's kind of

2391
01:36:37,540 --> 01:36:41,860
tough looking I guess Demi Moore could

2392
01:36:39,310 --> 01:36:46,060
look tough now and then and she has

2393
01:36:41,860 --> 01:36:49,000
contempt on her face and that's a

2394
01:36:46,060 --> 01:36:51,520
dangerous thing and in the background

2395
01:36:49,000 --> 01:36:54,460
there's nothing but images of

2396
01:36:51,520 --> 01:37:00,060
anteye far is and Berkeley riots and

2397
01:36:54,460 --> 01:37:03,100
fire and protest and she's describing

2398
01:37:00,060 --> 01:37:05,410
that as a conspiracy essentially a

2399
01:37:03,100 --> 01:37:06,970
conspiracy that involves the

2400
01:37:05,410 --> 01:37:12,310
intellectual elite including Hollywood

2401
01:37:06,970 --> 01:37:16,390
which is named by name the accusation is

2402
01:37:12,310 --> 01:37:20,470
is that there's a cabal of corrupt

2403
01:37:16,390 --> 01:37:21,580
intellectuals let's say who are bringing

2404
01:37:20,470 --> 01:37:24,100
the country to its knees

2405
01:37:21,580 --> 01:37:28,210
and that it's time to get your goddamn

2406
01:37:24,100 --> 01:37:33,580
guns and so look up that and see what

2407
01:37:28,210 --> 01:37:35,290
you think because there's lots of people

2408
01:37:33,580 --> 01:37:36,580
who would be perfectly happy if that was

2409
01:37:35,290 --> 01:37:39,070
the direction in which you were headed

2410
01:37:36,580 --> 01:37:40,900
and one of the things that I'm hoping is

2411
01:37:39,070 --> 01:37:43,390
that we might be able to talk our way

2412
01:37:40,900 --> 01:37:47,380
through it but we're in a situation

2413
01:37:43,390 --> 01:37:52,840
where every act of idiot individual

2414
01:37:47,380 --> 01:37:55,120
idiocy will push us one iota closer to

2415
01:37:52,840 --> 01:37:57,190
the brink and that'll make the 15

2416
01:37:55,120 --> 01:37:59,470
percent of the population or 30 percent

2417
01:37:57,190 --> 01:38:01,710
of the population who would love to see

2418
01:37:59,470 --> 01:38:05,880
everything degenerate into chaos

2419
01:38:01,710 --> 01:38:08,200
perfectly happy because that's their aim

2420
01:38:05,880 --> 01:38:09,760
the earth also was corrupt before God

2421
01:38:08,200 --> 01:38:11,350
and the earth was filled with violence

2422
01:38:09,760 --> 01:38:13,360
and God looked upon the earth and behold

2423
01:38:11,350 --> 01:38:15,340
it was corrupt for all flesh is

2424
01:38:13,360 --> 01:38:17,500
corrupted his way upon the earth and

2425
01:38:15,340 --> 01:38:19,480
Noah said and God said unto Noah the end

2426
01:38:17,500 --> 01:38:20,980
of all flesh has come before me for the

2427
01:38:19,480 --> 01:38:22,570
earth is filled with violence through

2428
01:38:20,980 --> 01:38:26,290
them and behold I will destroy them with

2429
01:38:22,570 --> 01:38:29,800
the earth make the an ark of gopher wood

2430
01:38:26,290 --> 01:38:31,330
rooms shalt thou make in the Ark from

2431
01:38:29,800 --> 01:38:33,520
that shalt pitch it within and without

2432
01:38:31,330 --> 01:38:35,260
with pitch and this is the fashion which

2433
01:38:33,520 --> 01:38:37,210
thou shalt make of it the length of the

2434
01:38:35,260 --> 01:38:38,800
ark shall be 300 cubits the breadth of

2435
01:38:37,210 --> 01:38:41,530
it 50 cubits in the height of it 30

2436
01:38:38,800 --> 01:38:43,300
cubits a window shalt thou make to the

2437
01:38:41,530 --> 01:38:45,070
ark and in a cubit shalt thou finish it

2438
01:38:43,300 --> 01:38:46,510
above and the door of the ark shalt thou

2439
01:38:45,070 --> 01:38:48,250
set in the side thereof with lower

2440
01:38:46,510 --> 01:38:53,200
second and third stories shalt thou make

2441
01:38:48,250 --> 01:38:54,820
it and behold I even I do bring a flood

2442
01:38:53,200 --> 01:38:57,220
of waters upon the earth to destroy all

2443
01:38:54,820 --> 01:38:59,140
flesh wherein is the breath of life from

2444
01:38:57,220 --> 01:39:02,050
under heaven and everything that is in

2445
01:38:59,140 --> 01:39:04,210
the earth shall die but with thee I will

2446
01:39:02,050 --> 01:39:05,050
establish my covenant and thou shalt

2447
01:39:04,210 --> 01:39:06,820
come into the are

2448
01:39:05,050 --> 01:39:09,310
thou and thy sons and thy wife and thy

2449
01:39:06,820 --> 01:39:11,200
sons wives with thee that's a fairly

2450
01:39:09,310 --> 01:39:14,110
optimistic twist on the story because

2451
01:39:11,200 --> 01:39:15,850
not only is it Noah but he gets to save

2452
01:39:14,110 --> 01:39:17,650
his whole family and down a couple of

2453
01:39:15,850 --> 01:39:20,830
generations and so that's a good thing

2454
01:39:17,650 --> 01:39:25,960
to think about it's like as things know

2455
01:39:20,830 --> 01:39:29,470
I had this client and she had a very

2456
01:39:25,960 --> 01:39:31,510
hard upbringing I would say not a lot of

2457
01:39:29,470 --> 01:39:34,150
encouragement to say the least let's say

2458
01:39:31,510 --> 01:39:37,090
a fair bit of discouraged meant and she

2459
01:39:34,150 --> 01:39:40,420
had a son and what was really

2460
01:39:37,090 --> 01:39:42,550
interesting about her in relationship to

2461
01:39:40,420 --> 01:39:44,590
her son is that all the things that she

2462
01:39:42,550 --> 01:39:47,110
could have learned to do to him

2463
01:39:44,590 --> 01:39:49,450
given her extensive experience with

2464
01:39:47,110 --> 01:39:51,010
being made as miserable as possible by

2465
01:39:49,450 --> 01:39:51,910
someone who was hell-bent on bringing

2466
01:39:51,010 --> 01:39:54,520
her to her knees

2467
01:39:51,910 --> 01:39:57,070
she refused to do to her son right she

2468
01:39:54,520 --> 01:39:59,170
learned the opposite lesson from all her

2469
01:39:57,070 --> 01:40:01,120
misery and torment which was not to move

2470
01:39:59,170 --> 01:40:03,310
that forward down the generations and so

2471
01:40:01,120 --> 01:40:05,790
the idea here is that if you walk

2472
01:40:03,310 --> 01:40:09,460
properly a name properly and act

2473
01:40:05,790 --> 01:40:11,140
properly if you walk with God in this

2474
01:40:09,460 --> 01:40:13,090
manner that we've been discussing is

2475
01:40:11,140 --> 01:40:14,890
that perhaps that isn't only good for

2476
01:40:13,090 --> 01:40:17,200
you perhaps it's also the thing that

2477
01:40:14,890 --> 01:40:19,060
will save your family and then by

2478
01:40:17,200 --> 01:40:20,620
implication perhaps saves Society

2479
01:40:19,060 --> 01:40:22,810
because that's exactly what happens with

2480
01:40:20,620 --> 01:40:24,700
Noah right first it's him and then it's

2481
01:40:22,810 --> 01:40:28,360
his family but everything else goes and

2482
01:40:24,700 --> 01:40:30,370
so by saving himself by acting properly

2483
01:40:28,360 --> 01:40:33,940
and by saving his family he actually

2484
01:40:30,370 --> 01:40:35,290
saves the world it's interesting you

2485
01:40:33,940 --> 01:40:38,770
know it's like the most profound people

2486
01:40:35,290 --> 01:40:40,630
that I've read who've meditated deeply

2487
01:40:38,770 --> 01:40:42,370
on the problem say of totalitarian

2488
01:40:40,630 --> 01:40:44,140
catastrophe and I would put Alexander

2489
01:40:42,370 --> 01:40:48,400
Solzhenitsyn at the top of that list

2490
01:40:44,140 --> 01:40:52,000
you know the his entire corpus three

2491
01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:55,870
volumes 700 pages long each in tiny type

2492
01:40:52,000 --> 01:41:01,690
is a long scream about the absolute

2493
01:40:55,870 --> 01:41:04,570
necessity of individual the absolute

2494
01:41:01,690 --> 01:41:07,690
necessity of individual honesty and

2495
01:41:04,570 --> 01:41:10,240
ethical behavior as the only bulwark

2496
01:41:07,690 --> 01:41:13,480
against totalitarian catastrophe and

2497
01:41:10,240 --> 01:41:16,030
that and I've read many writers who've

2498
01:41:13,480 --> 01:41:19,000
attempted to diagnose the problems of

2499
01:41:16,030 --> 01:41:22,390
the 20th century and I think

2500
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:24,700
elgyn Edson he came to the same

2501
01:41:22,390 --> 01:41:27,310
conclusions that Viktor Frankl came to

2502
01:41:24,700 --> 01:41:29,680
as a consequence of his experiences in

2503
01:41:27,310 --> 01:41:31,770
the Nazi concentration camps and Frankel

2504
01:41:29,680 --> 01:41:33,670
I am also an admirer of Franco but

2505
01:41:31,770 --> 01:41:36,220
Solzhenitsyn takes it to an entire

2506
01:41:33,670 --> 01:41:39,340
different level of profundity and makes

2507
01:41:36,220 --> 01:41:41,980
an extraordinarily strong case that not

2508
01:41:39,340 --> 01:41:44,170
only do societies deteriorate because

2509
01:41:41,980 --> 01:41:46,150
the people within the societies become

2510
01:41:44,170 --> 01:41:48,400
individually corrupt but that the only

2511
01:41:46,150 --> 01:41:50,170
way to stave that off is for the

2512
01:41:48,400 --> 01:41:52,240
individuals within that society to

2513
01:41:50,170 --> 01:41:54,100
reject that corruption in the in the

2514
01:41:52,240 --> 01:41:56,380
confines of their own personal lives and

2515
01:41:54,100 --> 01:41:59,200
he tells endless stories of people that

2516
01:41:56,380 --> 01:42:01,000
he met in the gulag and in the work

2517
01:41:59,200 --> 01:42:02,710
camps in the death camps in the Soviet

2518
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:04,720
Union of people and this is what he

2519
01:42:02,710 --> 01:42:08,230
learned of people who were so incredibly

2520
01:42:04,720 --> 01:42:11,110
tough that even under conditions the

2521
01:42:08,230 --> 01:42:13,150
most possible extreme conditions there

2522
01:42:11,110 --> 01:42:14,860
wasn't a chance that they were going to

2523
01:42:13,150 --> 01:42:16,990
step off that straight and narrow line

2524
01:42:14,860 --> 01:42:21,250
there was nothing the authorities could

2525
01:42:16,990 --> 01:42:23,080
do to move them and just watching that

2526
01:42:21,250 --> 01:42:24,400
was enough to transform Solzhenitsyn

2527
01:42:23,080 --> 01:42:26,980
because of course one of the things he

2528
01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:29,670
wondered was after spending a good

2529
01:42:26,980 --> 01:42:32,400
amount of time in the work camps was

2530
01:42:29,670 --> 01:42:35,230
well just exactly how did I get here and

2531
01:42:32,400 --> 01:42:36,520
it wasn't well it was Hitler's fault and

2532
01:42:35,230 --> 01:42:38,710
it was Stalin's fault although it was

2533
01:42:36,520 --> 01:42:40,720
definitely the fault of both of them for

2534
01:42:38,710 --> 01:42:42,760
Solzhenitsyn it was well it was also his

2535
01:42:40,720 --> 01:42:46,990
fault because he was playing the same

2536
01:42:42,760 --> 01:42:48,520
game he just wasn't as good at it and of

2537
01:42:46,990 --> 01:42:50,500
every living thing of all flesh two of

2538
01:42:48,520 --> 01:42:51,880
every sort shall thou bring into the ark

2539
01:42:50,500 --> 01:42:55,870
to keep them alive with thee they shall

2540
01:42:51,880 --> 01:42:57,430
be male and female and so there's

2541
01:42:55,870 --> 01:43:01,330
another message in this story which is

2542
01:42:57,430 --> 01:43:03,780
that it isn't only Noah and his family

2543
01:43:01,330 --> 01:43:07,000
and human society that's dependent on

2544
01:43:03,780 --> 01:43:12,310
Noah's appropriate actions in the world

2545
01:43:07,000 --> 01:43:15,550
it's the entire living planet and in an

2546
01:43:12,310 --> 01:43:19,810
era of excessive and extreme and

2547
01:43:15,550 --> 01:43:22,600
genuinely disingenuous environmental

2548
01:43:19,810 --> 01:43:27,780
catastrophe Singh that's something to

2549
01:43:22,600 --> 01:43:27,780
consider very seriously think

2550
01:43:30,599 --> 01:43:35,559
perhaps there's nothing better that you

2551
01:43:32,800 --> 01:43:37,449
can do for everything all things

2552
01:43:35,559 --> 01:43:38,889
considered including those things that

2553
01:43:37,449 --> 01:43:41,679
are outside the confines of human

2554
01:43:38,889 --> 01:43:44,530
society than to get your act together

2555
01:43:41,679 --> 01:43:47,409
and align yourself properly along all of

2556
01:43:44,530 --> 01:43:50,979
the dimensions of your being from from

2557
01:43:47,409 --> 01:43:52,959
from the tiniest microcosm to the to the

2558
01:43:50,979 --> 01:43:56,829
ultimate macrocosm and that's the way

2559
01:43:52,959 --> 01:44:01,090
that all of being is redeemed that's

2560
01:43:56,829 --> 01:44:03,699
what the story suggests and we read it

2561
01:44:01,090 --> 01:44:05,919
you know a cynical modern people we read

2562
01:44:03,699 --> 01:44:08,199
it as if it was written by primitive

2563
01:44:05,919 --> 01:44:09,999
people who thought that it was really

2564
01:44:08,199 --> 01:44:12,340
the case that someone could build a boat

2565
01:44:09,999 --> 01:44:15,659
and put two of every kind into it and

2566
01:44:12,340 --> 01:44:15,659
thereby saved the world

2567
01:44:16,289 --> 01:44:21,119
it's embarrassing to see things

2568
01:44:18,780 --> 01:44:23,219
interpreted in a manner that shallow

2569
01:44:21,119 --> 01:44:25,809
especially by people who don't have

2570
01:44:23,219 --> 01:44:27,519
ignorant as a justification you know

2571
01:44:25,809 --> 01:44:29,380
these stories have to appeal to everyone

2572
01:44:27,519 --> 01:44:31,780
right and there's lots of people in the

2573
01:44:29,380 --> 01:44:33,729
world who aren't very bright and so they

2574
01:44:31,780 --> 01:44:35,469
tend to take things concretely like a

2575
01:44:33,729 --> 01:44:37,149
child would take things concretely if

2576
01:44:35,469 --> 01:44:39,429
you read them a story and this story can

2577
01:44:37,149 --> 01:44:40,840
be taken concretely but it has to be

2578
01:44:39,429 --> 01:44:41,949
because these stories have to be for

2579
01:44:40,840 --> 01:44:43,829
everyone but if you're sophisticated

2580
01:44:41,949 --> 01:44:46,360
that doesn't mean that you should

2581
01:44:43,829 --> 01:44:48,099
dismiss it as if it's written for a

2582
01:44:46,360 --> 01:44:49,989
child it's maybe you have the obligation

2583
01:44:48,099 --> 01:44:51,280
to look a bit deeper and think for a

2584
01:44:49,989 --> 01:44:53,110
moment that it wouldn't been conserved

2585
01:44:51,280 --> 01:44:54,909
for these many thousands of years if

2586
01:44:53,110 --> 01:44:57,159
there wasn't something more to it than a

2587
01:44:54,909 --> 01:45:00,939
casual intellectual dismissal would

2588
01:44:57,159 --> 01:45:02,739
indicate and take thou on to the of all

2589
01:45:00,939 --> 01:45:04,479
food that is eaten and thou shalt gather

2590
01:45:02,739 --> 01:45:07,030
it to thee and shall be food for the end

2591
01:45:04,479 --> 01:45:12,039
for them thus did Noah according to all

2592
01:45:07,030 --> 01:45:13,840
that God commanded him so did he and the

2593
01:45:12,039 --> 01:45:15,760
Lord said unto Noah come thou and all

2594
01:45:13,840 --> 01:45:17,019
thy house into the ark for the I have

2595
01:45:15,760 --> 01:45:19,860
seen righteous before me in this

2596
01:45:17,019 --> 01:45:22,179
generation of every clean beast thou

2597
01:45:19,860 --> 01:45:23,590
shalt take to thee by sevens the male

2598
01:45:22,179 --> 01:45:25,689
and his female and a beasts that are

2599
01:45:23,590 --> 01:45:28,059
clean but not clean by two the male and

2600
01:45:25,689 --> 01:45:29,679
his female of follows also of the air by

2601
01:45:28,059 --> 01:45:31,869
sevens the male and the female to keep

2602
01:45:29,679 --> 01:45:34,899
seed alive upon the face of all the

2603
01:45:31,869 --> 01:45:37,269
earth for yet seven days I will cause it

2604
01:45:34,899 --> 01:45:38,649
to rain upon the earth forty days and

2605
01:45:37,269 --> 01:45:40,419
forty nights and every living substance

2606
01:45:38,649 --> 01:45:42,309
that I've made will I destroy from off

2607
01:45:40,419 --> 01:45:43,840
the face of the earth and Noah did

2608
01:45:42,309 --> 01:45:47,380
according unto all depth

2609
01:45:43,840 --> 01:45:49,330
lord commanded him and though it was 600

2610
01:45:47,380 --> 01:45:50,070
years old when the flood of waters was

2611
01:45:49,330 --> 01:45:52,420
upon the earth

2612
01:45:50,070 --> 01:45:54,040
and Noah went in and his sons and his

2613
01:45:52,420 --> 01:45:55,690
wife and his sons wives with him into

2614
01:45:54,040 --> 01:45:57,849
the ark because of the waters of the

2615
01:45:55,690 --> 01:45:59,320
flood of clean beasts and the beasts

2616
01:45:57,849 --> 01:46:00,639
that are not clean enough follows and of

2617
01:45:59,320 --> 01:46:03,340
everything that creepeth upon the earth

2618
01:46:00,639 --> 01:46:05,170
they went in 2 and 2 unto Noah into the

2619
01:46:03,340 --> 01:46:07,449
ark the male and the female as God had

2620
01:46:05,170 --> 01:46:09,610
commanded Noah and it came to pass after

2621
01:46:07,449 --> 01:46:12,639
seven days that the waters of the flood

2622
01:46:09,610 --> 01:46:14,139
were upon the earth in the six hundredth

2623
01:46:12,639 --> 01:46:16,150
year of Noah's life in the second month

2624
01:46:14,139 --> 01:46:18,190
the seventeenth day of the month the

2625
01:46:16,150 --> 01:46:20,860
same day were all the Fountains of the

2626
01:46:18,190 --> 01:46:22,659
great deep broken up and the windows of

2627
01:46:20,860 --> 01:46:24,489
heaven were opened and the rain was upon

2628
01:46:22,659 --> 01:46:27,489
the earth forty days and forty nights

2629
01:46:24,489 --> 01:46:29,139
and the self-same day entered Noah and

2630
01:46:27,489 --> 01:46:32,139
Shem and ham and Japheth

2631
01:46:29,139 --> 01:46:36,010
sons of Noah and Noah's wife and 3 wives

2632
01:46:32,139 --> 01:46:37,750
of his sons with them into the ark today

2633
01:46:36,010 --> 01:46:39,130
and every beast after his kind and all

2634
01:46:37,750 --> 01:46:40,630
of the cattle after their kind and every

2635
01:46:39,130 --> 01:46:42,520
creeping thing that creepeth upon the

2636
01:46:40,630 --> 01:46:44,380
earth after his kind and every fowl

2637
01:46:42,520 --> 01:46:46,330
after his kind every bird of every sort

2638
01:46:44,380 --> 01:46:48,849
and they went into Noah unto Noah into

2639
01:46:46,330 --> 01:46:55,929
the ark two and two of all flesh wherein

2640
01:46:48,849 --> 01:46:59,310
is the breath of life that makes know

2641
01:46:55,929 --> 01:47:05,679
where they ultimate Shepherd right

2642
01:46:59,310 --> 01:47:10,300
Shepherd of all things tender of the

2643
01:47:05,679 --> 01:47:13,239
garden and Shepherd of all things that's

2644
01:47:10,300 --> 01:47:14,710
a hell of a roll and maybe that's the

2645
01:47:13,239 --> 01:47:18,820
one that keeps you afloat during the

2646
01:47:14,710 --> 01:47:20,500
flood and they that went in went in male

2647
01:47:18,820 --> 01:47:21,880
and female of all flesh as God had

2648
01:47:20,500 --> 01:47:23,650
commanded him and the Lord showed him in

2649
01:47:21,880 --> 01:47:25,389
and the flood was forty days upon the

2650
01:47:23,650 --> 01:47:27,010
earth and the waters increased and bear

2651
01:47:25,389 --> 01:47:29,080
up the ark and it was left up above the

2652
01:47:27,010 --> 01:47:32,349
earth and the waters prevailed and were

2653
01:47:29,080 --> 01:47:34,330
increased greatly upon the earth 15

2654
01:47:32,349 --> 01:47:40,389
cubits upward did the waters prevail and

2655
01:47:34,330 --> 01:47:42,310
the mountains were covered and all flesh

2656
01:47:40,389 --> 01:47:43,960
died that moved upon the earth both of

2657
01:47:42,310 --> 01:47:45,340
fallen of cattle and the beasts and of

2658
01:47:43,960 --> 01:47:48,099
every creeping thing that creepeth upon

2659
01:47:45,340 --> 01:47:50,290
the earth and every man and all in whose

2660
01:47:48,099 --> 01:47:54,670
nostrils was the breath of life of all

2661
01:47:50,290 --> 01:47:56,560
that was in the dry land died and every

2662
01:47:54,670 --> 01:47:57,760
living substance was destroyed which was

2663
01:47:56,560 --> 01:47:59,710
upon the face of the earth

2664
01:47:57,760 --> 01:48:01,360
both man and cattle and the creeping

2665
01:47:59,710 --> 01:48:03,310
things in the fall of the heaven and

2666
01:48:01,360 --> 01:48:05,590
they were destroyed from the earth and

2667
01:48:03,310 --> 01:48:07,510
Noah only remained alive and they that

2668
01:48:05,590 --> 01:48:08,739
were with him in the ark and the waters

2669
01:48:07,510 --> 01:48:12,760
prevailed upon the earth

2670
01:48:08,739 --> 01:48:14,320
one hundred and fifty days and God

2671
01:48:12,760 --> 01:48:15,610
remembered Noah every living thing and

2672
01:48:14,320 --> 01:48:18,130
all the cattle that was with him in the

2673
01:48:15,610 --> 01:48:21,460
ark and God made a wind to pass over the

2674
01:48:18,130 --> 01:48:23,080
earth and the waters receded the

2675
01:48:21,460 --> 01:48:24,520
Fountains also of the deep and the

2676
01:48:23,080 --> 01:48:25,960
windows of heaven were stopped in the

2677
01:48:24,520 --> 01:48:27,280
rain from heaven was restrained and the

2678
01:48:25,960 --> 01:48:29,140
waters returned from off the earth

2679
01:48:27,280 --> 01:48:30,760
continually and after the end of a

2680
01:48:29,140 --> 01:48:33,790
hundred and fifty days the waters were

2681
01:48:30,760 --> 01:48:35,230
abated and the ark rested in the seventh

2682
01:48:33,790 --> 01:48:36,910
month on the seventeenth day of the

2683
01:48:35,230 --> 01:48:38,950
month upon the mountains of Ararat and

2684
01:48:36,910 --> 01:48:41,020
the waters decreased continually until

2685
01:48:38,950 --> 01:48:42,640
the tenth month in the tenth month on

2686
01:48:41,020 --> 01:48:45,970
the first day of the month were the tops

2687
01:48:42,640 --> 01:48:47,650
of the mountains seen and it came to

2688
01:48:45,970 --> 01:48:49,060
pass at the end of 40 days that Noah

2689
01:48:47,650 --> 01:48:51,070
opened the window of the ark which he

2690
01:48:49,060 --> 01:48:52,840
had made and he sent forth a raven which

2691
01:48:51,070 --> 01:48:55,690
went to and fro until the waters were

2692
01:48:52,840 --> 01:48:57,580
dried up from off the earth and he also

2693
01:48:55,690 --> 01:48:59,230
sent forth a dove from him to see if the

2694
01:48:57,580 --> 01:49:00,910
water's were abated from off the face of

2695
01:48:59,230 --> 01:49:02,230
the ground but the devil found no rest

2696
01:49:00,910 --> 01:49:04,630
for the sole of her foot and she

2697
01:49:02,230 --> 01:49:05,890
returned unto him in the ark for the

2698
01:49:04,630 --> 01:49:07,960
waters were on the face of the whole

2699
01:49:05,890 --> 01:49:10,060
earth then he put forth his hand and

2700
01:49:07,960 --> 01:49:12,100
took her and pulled her in unto him into

2701
01:49:10,060 --> 01:49:14,140
the ark and he stayed yet another seven

2702
01:49:12,100 --> 01:49:16,989
days and again he sent forth the dove

2703
01:49:14,140 --> 01:49:18,340
out of the ark and the Dove came in to

2704
01:49:16,989 --> 01:49:20,710
him in the evening and lo in her mouth

2705
01:49:18,340 --> 01:49:22,120
was an olive leaf plucked off so Noah

2706
01:49:20,710 --> 01:49:25,000
knew that the waters were abated from

2707
01:49:22,120 --> 01:49:26,650
off the earth and he stayed there yet

2708
01:49:25,000 --> 01:49:28,450
another seven days and sent forth the

2709
01:49:26,650 --> 01:49:28,960
Dove which returned not again unto him

2710
01:49:28,450 --> 01:49:30,640
anymore

2711
01:49:28,960 --> 01:49:33,220
and it came to pass in the six hundredth

2712
01:49:30,640 --> 01:49:35,200
and first year in the first month the

2713
01:49:33,220 --> 01:49:36,760
first day of the month the waters were

2714
01:49:35,200 --> 01:49:38,890
dried up from off the earth and Noah

2715
01:49:36,760 --> 01:49:41,020
removed the covering of the ark had

2716
01:49:38,890 --> 01:49:44,680
looked up and behold the face of the

2717
01:49:41,020 --> 01:49:46,150
ground was dry and in the second month

2718
01:49:44,680 --> 01:49:48,850
on the seventh and twentieth day of the

2719
01:49:46,150 --> 01:49:50,920
month was the earth dried and God spake

2720
01:49:48,850 --> 01:49:53,260
unto Noah saying go forth of the ark

2721
01:49:50,920 --> 01:49:56,200
thou and thy wife and thy sons and thy

2722
01:49:53,260 --> 01:49:58,060
sons wives with thee bring forth with

2723
01:49:56,200 --> 01:50:00,940
the every living thing that is with thee

2724
01:49:58,060 --> 01:50:02,050
of all flesh both of fowl and of cattle

2725
01:50:00,940 --> 01:50:04,570
and of every creeping thing that

2726
01:50:02,050 --> 01:50:06,280
creepeth upon the earth that they may

2727
01:50:04,570 --> 01:50:08,110
breed abundantly in the earth and be

2728
01:50:06,280 --> 01:50:09,640
fruitful and multiply upon the earth and

2729
01:50:08,110 --> 01:50:11,560
Noah went forth and his sons and his

2730
01:50:09,640 --> 01:50:13,570
wife and his sons wives with them

2731
01:50:11,560 --> 01:50:15,550
beast creeping thing every fowl and

2732
01:50:13,570 --> 01:50:17,940
whatsoever creepeth upon the earth after

2733
01:50:15,550 --> 01:50:20,950
their kinds went forth out of the ark

2734
01:50:17,940 --> 01:50:22,870
and Noah builded an altar unto the Lord

2735
01:50:20,950 --> 01:50:25,060
and took of every clean beast and of

2736
01:50:22,870 --> 01:50:28,270
every clean fowl and offered burnt

2737
01:50:25,060 --> 01:50:34,030
offerings on the altar immediate returns

2738
01:50:28,270 --> 01:50:36,700
the sacrificial motif and the Lord

2739
01:50:34,030 --> 01:50:39,820
smelled a sweet savour and that's Noah's

2740
01:50:36,700 --> 01:50:41,620
proper sacrifice and the Lord said into

2741
01:50:39,820 --> 01:50:44,560
his heart I will not again curse the

2742
01:50:41,620 --> 01:50:46,360
ground any more for man's sake for the

2743
01:50:44,560 --> 01:50:49,570
imagination of man's heart is evil from

2744
01:50:46,360 --> 01:50:51,520
his youth neither will I again smite any

2745
01:50:49,570 --> 01:50:53,680
more every living thing as I have done

2746
01:50:51,520 --> 01:50:55,510
while the earth remaineth seedtime and

2747
01:50:53,680 --> 01:50:59,100
harvest and cold and heat and summer and

2748
01:50:55,510 --> 01:51:01,480
winter and day and night shall not cease

2749
01:50:59,100 --> 01:51:03,190
and God blessed Noah and his sons and

2750
01:51:01,480 --> 01:51:06,340
said unto them be fruitful and multiply

2751
01:51:03,190 --> 01:51:07,660
and replenish the earth and the fear of

2752
01:51:06,340 --> 01:51:09,970
you and the dread of you shall be upon

2753
01:51:07,660 --> 01:51:12,280
every beast of the earth and upon every

2754
01:51:09,970 --> 01:51:14,380
fowl of the air upon all that moveth

2755
01:51:12,280 --> 01:51:16,270
upon the earth upon all the fishes of

2756
01:51:14,380 --> 01:51:18,300
the sea into your hand are they

2757
01:51:16,270 --> 01:51:18,300
delivered

2758
01:51:24,900 --> 01:51:36,700
you know I've heard commentators David

2759
01:51:30,070 --> 01:51:41,590
Suzuki for example who claimed that the

2760
01:51:36,700 --> 01:51:46,000
substructure of Western culture in lines

2761
01:51:41,590 --> 01:51:48,010
such as this deliver the earth over to

2762
01:51:46,000 --> 01:51:55,330
human beings and and justify our

2763
01:51:48,010 --> 01:51:57,940
ravaging of the of being but I don't

2764
01:51:55,330 --> 01:52:01,810
think that that's a very careful reading

2765
01:51:57,940 --> 01:52:04,300
and it seems to me that given such

2766
01:52:01,810 --> 01:52:05,890
matters given the importance of such

2767
01:52:04,300 --> 01:52:09,280
matters that a very close reading is

2768
01:52:05,890 --> 01:52:11,800
actually necessary you know in the story

2769
01:52:09,280 --> 01:52:14,320
of Adam and Eve when Adam and Eve are

2770
01:52:11,800 --> 01:52:17,020
thrown out of the garden God tells Eve

2771
01:52:14,320 --> 01:52:19,060
that she's going to be subordinated to

2772
01:52:17,020 --> 01:52:20,700
her husband he doesn't say that that's

2773
01:52:19,060 --> 01:52:23,320
what should happened

2774
01:52:20,700 --> 01:52:25,240
he says that's what's going to happen

2775
01:52:23,320 --> 01:52:27,280
and the same thing as far as I'm

2776
01:52:25,240 --> 01:52:29,890
concerned is contained in lines like

2777
01:52:27,280 --> 01:52:31,150
this isn't necessarily that this is

2778
01:52:29,890 --> 01:52:33,910
something that should happen it's

2779
01:52:31,150 --> 01:52:36,130
something that did to happen it's quite

2780
01:52:33,910 --> 01:52:39,310
remarkable you know to think about how

2781
01:52:36,130 --> 01:52:42,040
long ago these lines were penned it

2782
01:52:39,310 --> 01:52:43,780
wasn't obvious until perhaps the 1960s

2783
01:52:42,040 --> 01:52:46,810
that we had dominated the earth so

2784
01:52:43,780 --> 01:52:49,660
completely that it's very future

2785
01:52:46,810 --> 01:52:55,450
existence within our hands and that's a

2786
01:52:49,660 --> 01:52:56,560
prophetic element of this tale and the

2787
01:52:55,450 --> 01:52:58,270
fear of you and the dread of you shall

2788
01:52:56,560 --> 01:52:59,800
be upon every beast of the earth and

2789
01:52:58,270 --> 01:53:02,620
upon every fowl of the air and upon all

2790
01:52:59,800 --> 01:53:04,690
that moveth upon the earth and upon all

2791
01:53:02,620 --> 01:53:08,670
the fishes of the sea into your hand are

2792
01:53:04,690 --> 01:53:10,960
they delivered like that's exactly right

2793
01:53:08,670 --> 01:53:12,820
every moving thing that liveth shall be

2794
01:53:10,960 --> 01:53:15,010
meat for you even as the green herb I've

2795
01:53:12,820 --> 01:53:16,870
given you all things have I given you

2796
01:53:15,010 --> 01:53:18,670
all things but flesh with the life

2797
01:53:16,870 --> 01:53:23,830
thereof which is the blood thereof shall

2798
01:53:18,670 --> 01:53:25,780
you not eat and surely your blood of

2799
01:53:23,830 --> 01:53:27,280
your lives will I require at the hand of

2800
01:53:25,780 --> 01:53:28,930
every beast will I require it at the

2801
01:53:27,280 --> 01:53:30,670
hand of man at the hand of every man's

2802
01:53:28,930 --> 01:53:33,610
brother will I require the life of man

2803
01:53:30,670 --> 01:53:37,640
this is a hard section to interpret but

2804
01:53:33,610 --> 01:53:39,740
what it means is something like this God

2805
01:53:37,640 --> 01:53:44,110
describes the dominion over the planet

2806
01:53:39,740 --> 01:53:47,330
that vilified humanity will have and

2807
01:53:44,110 --> 01:53:49,580
note the power that goes along with that

2808
01:53:47,330 --> 01:53:53,390
and then puts a limitation on it and the

2809
01:53:49,580 --> 01:53:56,810
limitation is maintain the sanctity of

2810
01:53:53,390 --> 01:54:00,440
life despite your power and although

2811
01:53:56,810 --> 01:54:02,780
it's not easy to extract from the manner

2812
01:54:00,440 --> 01:54:05,840
in which this is being translated what

2813
01:54:02,780 --> 01:54:08,600
God is telling Noah is that if you kill

2814
01:54:05,840 --> 01:54:10,790
yourself if you kill someone else and if

2815
01:54:08,600 --> 01:54:13,550
any animal kills a human being that

2816
01:54:10,790 --> 01:54:17,170
there will be a price to pay for that so

2817
01:54:13,550 --> 01:54:20,060
there's a an opportunity which is that

2818
01:54:17,170 --> 01:54:22,640
the descendants of Noah can dominate the

2819
01:54:20,060 --> 01:54:26,090
earth but there's a moral limitation

2820
01:54:22,640 --> 01:54:29,450
placed on that which is nonetheless life

2821
01:54:26,090 --> 01:54:35,120
itself is to be regarded as sanctified

2822
01:54:29,450 --> 01:54:37,310
and sacred whoever shared if man's blood

2823
01:54:35,120 --> 01:54:40,910
by man shall his blood be shed for in

2824
01:54:37,310 --> 01:54:42,860
the image of God made he mad and you be

2825
01:54:40,910 --> 01:54:44,110
you fruitful and multiply bring forth

2826
01:54:42,860 --> 01:54:48,980
abundantly in the earth and multiply

2827
01:54:44,110 --> 01:54:51,560
therein and God spake unto Noah and to

2828
01:54:48,980 --> 01:54:53,210
his sons with him saying and I behold I

2829
01:54:51,560 --> 01:54:55,010
establish my covenant with you and with

2830
01:54:53,210 --> 01:54:56,450
your seed after you and with every

2831
01:54:55,010 --> 01:54:57,920
living creature that is with you of the

2832
01:54:56,450 --> 01:55:00,560
fowl and the cattle and of every beast

2833
01:54:57,920 --> 01:55:02,060
of Earth that is with you for all that

2834
01:55:00,560 --> 01:55:05,810
go out of the ark to every beast of the

2835
01:55:02,060 --> 01:55:10,310
earth and I will establish my covenant

2836
01:55:05,810 --> 01:55:11,810
with you neither shall all flesh be cut

2837
01:55:10,310 --> 01:55:13,520
off anymore by the waters of a flood

2838
01:55:11,810 --> 01:55:17,120
neither shall there be anymore

2839
01:55:13,520 --> 01:55:18,350
a flood to destroy the earth and God

2840
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:20,060
said this is the token of the Covenant

2841
01:55:18,350 --> 01:55:21,200
which I make between me and you and

2842
01:55:20,060 --> 01:55:23,540
every living creature that is with you

2843
01:55:21,200 --> 01:55:25,700
for perpetual generations I do set my

2844
01:55:23,540 --> 01:55:27,380
bow in the cloud and it shall be for a

2845
01:55:25,700 --> 01:55:29,270
token of a covenant between me and the

2846
01:55:27,380 --> 01:55:30,650
earth and shall come to pass when I

2847
01:55:29,270 --> 01:55:32,750
bring a cloud over the earth that the

2848
01:55:30,650 --> 01:55:35,090
bow shall be seen in the cloud and I

2849
01:55:32,750 --> 01:55:36,380
will remember my covenant which is

2850
01:55:35,090 --> 01:55:38,120
between me and you and every living

2851
01:55:36,380 --> 01:55:39,500
creature of all flesh and the waters

2852
01:55:38,120 --> 01:55:42,680
shall no more become a flood to destroy

2853
01:55:39,500 --> 01:55:45,350
all flesh there's a negotiated agreement

2854
01:55:42,680 --> 01:55:50,280
there of sorts and the negotiated

2855
01:55:45,350 --> 01:55:52,680
agreement is as far as I can tell

2856
01:55:50,280 --> 01:55:56,760
to the degree that humanity agrees to

2857
01:55:52,680 --> 01:56:00,030
act in the manner of Noah then the

2858
01:55:56,760 --> 01:56:10,980
threat of catastrophic destruction will

2859
01:56:00,030 --> 01:56:12,330
remain at bay and the bow shall be in

2860
01:56:10,980 --> 01:56:13,710
the cloud and I will look upon it that I

2861
01:56:12,330 --> 01:56:15,360
may remember the everlasting covenant

2862
01:56:13,710 --> 01:56:17,820
between God and every living creature of

2863
01:56:15,360 --> 01:56:20,040
all flesh that is upon the earth and God

2864
01:56:17,820 --> 01:56:21,990
said unto Noah this is the token of the

2865
01:56:20,040 --> 01:56:25,700
Covenant which I've established between

2866
01:56:21,990 --> 01:56:25,700
me and all flesh that is upon the earth

2867
01:56:28,850 --> 01:56:32,730
this is the token of the Covenant which

2868
01:56:31,170 --> 01:56:38,880
I've established between me and all

2869
01:56:32,730 --> 01:56:42,480
flesh that is upon the earth so that's a

2870
01:56:38,880 --> 01:56:44,700
good place to stop and there's no

2871
01:56:42,480 --> 01:56:46,050
lecture next week by the way because the

2872
01:56:44,700 --> 01:56:48,300
theater was booked so there'll be a

2873
01:56:46,050 --> 01:56:51,030
one-week break and then when we get back

2874
01:56:48,300 --> 01:56:53,670
we'll finish the story of Noah there's

2875
01:56:51,030 --> 01:56:55,020
not much left of it we'll talk about the

2876
01:56:53,670 --> 01:56:56,850
Tower of Babel which is a very short

2877
01:56:55,020 --> 01:56:59,460
story but a very very interesting one

2878
01:56:56,850 --> 01:57:02,520
and then we'll move on to the story of

2879
01:56:59,460 --> 01:57:04,160
Abraham and so thank you very much for

2880
01:57:02,520 --> 01:57:22,359
coming and we'll see you in two weeks

2881
01:57:04,160 --> 01:57:22,359
[Applause]

2882
01:57:22,390 --> 01:57:27,200
now is the person who has the

2883
01:57:25,010 --> 01:57:29,150
notification for the meetup after this

2884
01:57:27,200 --> 01:57:31,430
here and do they have the notification

2885
01:57:29,150 --> 01:57:32,870
okay because if you give that to me this

2886
01:57:31,430 --> 01:57:37,240
time I'll remember to read it before

2887
01:57:32,870 --> 01:57:42,290
everyone leaves so do you want to start

2888
01:57:37,240 --> 01:57:43,640
okay so see it let's see if the mic is

2889
01:57:42,290 --> 01:57:47,410
working because lots of people will

2890
01:57:43,640 --> 01:57:50,000
listen to this question and so okay okay

2891
01:57:47,410 --> 01:57:51,410
so you said on a recent livestream that

2892
01:57:50,000 --> 01:57:53,120
you were to you didn't have enough

2893
01:57:51,410 --> 01:57:55,850
energy to answer this question but you

2894
01:57:53,120 --> 01:57:58,370
said it was intriguing so I was

2895
01:57:55,850 --> 01:58:01,730
wondering if you had the energy to

2896
01:57:58,370 --> 01:58:05,590
answer how someone might help someone

2897
01:58:01,730 --> 01:58:05,590
that has borderline personality disorder

2898
01:58:05,950 --> 01:58:18,770
by example by example no no no I don't I

2899
01:58:16,880 --> 01:58:21,800
don't mean that precisely I mean that

2900
01:58:18,770 --> 01:58:23,750
the let's not take borderline

2901
01:58:21,800 --> 01:58:26,660
personality disorder precisely as the

2902
01:58:23,750 --> 01:58:28,820
example okay I understand the question

2903
01:58:26,660 --> 01:58:31,730
the question to some degree is how do

2904
01:58:28,820 --> 01:58:34,940
you help someone that's lost and answer

2905
01:58:31,730 --> 01:58:37,820
that is if they aren't willing to not be

2906
01:58:34,940 --> 01:58:40,780
lost you cannot help them and I would

2907
01:58:37,820 --> 01:58:43,070
also say that as a clinician you see I

2908
01:58:40,780 --> 01:58:45,350
mean it's an it's a statement that's

2909
01:58:43,070 --> 01:58:49,180
informed I would say by mythological

2910
01:58:45,350 --> 01:58:53,180
knowledge but also by straight clinical

2911
01:58:49,180 --> 01:58:54,620
wisdom not mine particularly I mean one

2912
01:58:53,180 --> 01:58:55,730
of the things that Carl Rogers pointed

2913
01:58:54,620 --> 01:58:57,140
out was that there were necessary

2914
01:58:55,730 --> 01:58:59,030
preconditions for entering into a

2915
01:58:57,140 --> 01:59:00,890
therapeutic relationship and that would

2916
01:58:59,030 --> 01:59:02,900
be really any relationship where the

2917
01:59:00,890 --> 01:59:05,780
mutual flourishing of the two people

2918
01:59:02,900 --> 01:59:07,550
involved was the Paramount goal and one

2919
01:59:05,780 --> 01:59:09,490
of the preconditions was that both

2920
01:59:07,550 --> 01:59:13,810
people had to want that to happen and

2921
01:59:09,490 --> 01:59:16,100
Rogers believed he didn't know how to

2922
01:59:13,810 --> 01:59:17,930
get the horse to drink when she had

2923
01:59:16,100 --> 01:59:20,330
brought it to the water and I thought

2924
01:59:17,930 --> 01:59:22,820
about that a lot because when people are

2925
01:59:20,330 --> 01:59:27,050
really lost sometimes they're so lost

2926
01:59:22,820 --> 01:59:28,010
that that they can't be found and I

2927
01:59:27,050 --> 01:59:29,390
think the only thing

2928
01:59:28,010 --> 01:59:33,970
that you can do in a situation like that

2929
01:59:29,390 --> 01:59:36,590
is get your life together and she and

2930
01:59:33,970 --> 01:59:39,250
manifest the reality of an alternative

2931
01:59:36,590 --> 01:59:42,950
mode of being that's what you've got and

2932
01:59:39,250 --> 01:59:46,730
so that's the only way I know of to

2933
01:59:42,950 --> 01:59:49,460
solve an intractable problem and I would

2934
01:59:46,730 --> 01:59:51,140
say the reason that I went down that

2935
01:59:49,460 --> 01:59:52,850
direction with regards to borderline

2936
01:59:51,140 --> 01:59:54,530
personality disorders because it's one

2937
01:59:52,850 --> 01:59:57,370
of the most serious of the personality

2938
01:59:54,530 --> 02:00:01,220
sort is very difficult to treat and so

2939
01:59:57,370 --> 02:00:03,880
I'll generalize from that to situations

2940
02:00:01,220 --> 02:00:06,170
that are very difficult to deal with and

2941
02:00:03,880 --> 02:00:07,700
you know there's a statement to and this

2942
02:00:06,170 --> 02:00:09,770
has nothing to do with borderline

2943
02:00:07,700 --> 02:00:11,180
personality disorder per se there's a

2944
02:00:09,770 --> 02:00:13,070
statement in the New Testament that's

2945
02:00:11,180 --> 02:00:14,300
really vicious in fact there's a number

2946
02:00:13,070 --> 02:00:17,330
of them but this is a particularly

2947
02:00:14,300 --> 02:00:20,660
vicious one and that is don't cast

2948
02:00:17,330 --> 02:00:23,480
pearls before swine and what that means

2949
02:00:20,660 --> 02:00:27,260
is if you're trying to help and it

2950
02:00:23,480 --> 02:00:29,900
doesn't work then stop helping it's not

2951
02:00:27,260 --> 02:00:30,380
helping right it may be just wasting

2952
02:00:29,900 --> 02:00:33,110
your time

2953
02:00:30,380 --> 02:00:34,940
it might be making things worse no if

2954
02:00:33,110 --> 02:00:37,550
you're if you're offering something and

2955
02:00:34,940 --> 02:00:39,220
it's not taken then perhaps you should

2956
02:00:37,550 --> 02:00:43,100
be offering it somewhere else and

2957
02:00:39,220 --> 02:00:44,750
sometimes if you offer hand and the

2958
02:00:43,100 --> 02:00:47,300
person won't take it you have to stop

2959
02:00:44,750 --> 02:00:50,390
offering the hand and then what you do

2960
02:00:47,300 --> 02:00:52,370
is you go off and you have your life and

2961
02:00:50,390 --> 02:00:53,630
sometimes that means in people's lives

2962
02:00:52,370 --> 02:00:55,340
for example that they have to leave

2963
02:00:53,630 --> 02:00:56,720
their family members behind there's a

2964
02:00:55,340 --> 02:00:58,820
scene in the New Testament this is

2965
02:00:56,720 --> 02:01:00,290
another very harsh scene where Christ is

2966
02:00:58,820 --> 02:01:02,810
walking down the road with his disciples

2967
02:01:00,290 --> 02:01:04,820
I hope I've got this story right but

2968
02:01:02,810 --> 02:01:07,400
I've got it essentially right and his

2969
02:01:04,820 --> 02:01:10,400
mother calls to him and says I believe

2970
02:01:07,400 --> 02:01:13,550
that he's supposed to come back to the

2971
02:01:10,400 --> 02:01:15,260
home because his uncle has died and that

2972
02:01:13,550 --> 02:01:18,260
there's going to be a funeral and he

2973
02:01:15,260 --> 02:01:20,930
turns to his mother and says something

2974
02:01:18,260 --> 02:01:23,210
like let the dead bury their dead I'm

2975
02:01:20,930 --> 02:01:25,310
about my father's business it's

2976
02:01:23,210 --> 02:01:27,710
something like that and you read that

2977
02:01:25,310 --> 02:01:30,620
you think huh that should have been

2978
02:01:27,710 --> 02:01:32,030
edited out no but it shouldn't have been

2979
02:01:30,620 --> 02:01:33,710
added it out because it's exactly right

2980
02:01:32,030 --> 02:01:37,190
because sometimes the thing you do is

2981
02:01:33,710 --> 02:01:41,030
walk away because there's no other

2982
02:01:37,190 --> 02:01:41,749
solution and if you are trapped in

2983
02:01:41,030 --> 02:01:43,309
pathologic

2984
02:01:41,749 --> 02:01:45,289
relationships and you see no way out of

2985
02:01:43,309 --> 02:01:47,419
them if you if someone who is thinking

2986
02:01:45,289 --> 02:01:49,819
has their hands around your neck and is

2987
02:01:47,419 --> 02:01:52,399
pulling you down you're not obligated to

2988
02:01:49,819 --> 02:01:54,259
drown with them now there's a rule too

2989
02:01:52,399 --> 02:01:56,149
if you're a lifeguard you know some of

2990
02:01:54,259 --> 02:01:57,679
you have had lifeguard training how do

2991
02:01:56,149 --> 02:02:01,009
you approach someone who's drowning and

2992
02:01:57,679 --> 02:02:04,309
panicking in the water feed out right

2993
02:02:01,009 --> 02:02:05,719
like this it's like I'll save you but

2994
02:02:04,309 --> 02:02:09,169
that doesn't mean you get to drown me

2995
02:02:05,719 --> 02:02:12,819
while I'm doing it and if it's you drown

2996
02:02:09,169 --> 02:02:18,019
or both of us drown it's you drown and

2997
02:02:12,819 --> 02:02:28,609
that's wisdom that's not cruelty right

2998
02:02:18,019 --> 02:02:30,679
so yeah a couple of questions about

2999
02:02:28,609 --> 02:02:33,829
dialog and engaging in dialogue with

3000
02:02:30,679 --> 02:02:36,019
people so the first issue that I face is

3001
02:02:33,829 --> 02:02:39,379
I have a very high need for intellectual

3002
02:02:36,019 --> 02:02:42,829
stimulation and I can't get that with

3003
02:02:39,379 --> 02:02:44,419
most people it's something like you can

3004
02:02:42,829 --> 02:02:49,009
you can have a dialogue for a time but

3005
02:02:44,419 --> 02:02:50,509
then titrate openness yeah and then I

3006
02:02:49,009 --> 02:02:53,479
would then they started run out of ideas

3007
02:02:50,509 --> 02:02:53,989
they can keep up and it sort of falls

3008
02:02:53,479 --> 02:02:55,009
apart

3009
02:02:53,989 --> 02:02:58,039
okay this is the problem that

3010
02:02:55,009 --> 02:03:00,439
intellectuals have quite frequently is

3011
02:02:58,039 --> 02:03:02,149
that they sort of once they start

3012
02:03:00,439 --> 02:03:04,879
reading difficult and rewarding stuff

3013
02:03:02,149 --> 02:03:06,649
yeah they stopped wanting to talk to

3014
02:03:04,879 --> 02:03:08,239
regular people and I think that

3015
02:03:06,649 --> 02:03:09,879
contributes to the disconnect that you

3016
02:03:08,239 --> 02:03:12,349
see between intellectuals and

3017
02:03:09,879 --> 02:03:14,359
working-class people and stuff like that

3018
02:03:12,349 --> 02:03:16,129
and the other question I had was about

3019
02:03:14,359 --> 02:03:19,129
okay wait I don't know if that's a

3020
02:03:16,129 --> 02:03:20,749
question I mean I believe there's a

3021
02:03:19,129 --> 02:03:23,959
question in there but I digress tchen is

3022
02:03:20,749 --> 02:03:27,139
how did we dress that how should I dress

3023
02:03:23,959 --> 02:03:28,849
it and is that something that can be

3024
02:03:27,139 --> 02:03:30,229
dressed well part of part of the answer

3025
02:03:28,849 --> 02:03:33,259
to that is that's what the universities

3026
02:03:30,229 --> 02:03:36,769
were for I mean you know not everybody

3027
02:03:33,259 --> 02:03:38,959
is equipped to or interested in engaging

3028
02:03:36,769 --> 02:03:40,669
in high-level discussion of abstract and

3029
02:03:38,959 --> 02:03:42,859
creative ideas you know you hear this

3030
02:03:40,669 --> 02:03:46,189
idea that everyone's creative that's a

3031
02:03:42,859 --> 02:03:49,459
lie it's as straightforward as that drew

3032
02:03:46,189 --> 02:03:51,829
creativity is very very rare and so and

3033
02:03:49,459 --> 02:03:52,909
if you happen to be a creative person or

3034
02:03:51,829 --> 02:03:54,919
if you happen to be someone who's

3035
02:03:52,909 --> 02:03:55,459
profoundly interested in ideas you are

3036
02:03:54,919 --> 02:03:57,889
in a

3037
02:03:55,459 --> 02:03:59,479
pronounced minority just as you are if

3038
02:03:57,889 --> 02:04:01,550
you happen to be extremely extroverted

3039
02:03:59,479 --> 02:04:03,739
or extremely agreeable or extremely

3040
02:04:01,550 --> 02:04:05,719
conscientious these are minority issues

3041
02:04:03,739 --> 02:04:08,389
and what you do is you find like-minded

3042
02:04:05,719 --> 02:04:11,119
people who are capable of engaging that

3043
02:04:08,389 --> 02:04:13,459
you know a heavy weight with heavy

3044
02:04:11,119 --> 02:04:15,769
weight weight lifters compete with heavy

3045
02:04:13,459 --> 02:04:17,449
weight weight lifters for a reason and

3046
02:04:15,769 --> 02:04:19,369
everyone thinks that's fine the same

3047
02:04:17,449 --> 02:04:22,010
thing applies to intellectual and

3048
02:04:19,369 --> 02:04:25,539
creative endeavors so what you do is you

3049
02:04:22,010 --> 02:04:28,159
try to find a community where that's

3050
02:04:25,539 --> 02:04:29,539
that's the nature of the community and

3051
02:04:28,159 --> 02:04:33,739
you likely have to find a relationship

3052
02:04:29,539 --> 02:04:35,659
like that as well you know so I don't

3053
02:04:33,739 --> 02:04:37,489
think so I think what contributes to the

3054
02:04:35,659 --> 02:04:40,599
siloing is the arrogance that goes along

3055
02:04:37,489 --> 02:04:42,679
with it because if you're you can be

3056
02:04:40,599 --> 02:04:45,079
interested in ideas and you can be

3057
02:04:42,679 --> 02:04:46,610
creative well that's the arrogance of

3058
02:04:45,079 --> 02:04:48,079
the intellect right that's the thing the

3059
02:04:46,610 --> 02:04:49,519
Catholic Church had warned about for

3060
02:04:48,079 --> 02:04:52,159
centuries is the arrogance of the

3061
02:04:49,519 --> 02:04:54,709
intellect so because if you're if you're

3062
02:04:52,159 --> 02:04:56,300
wise as well as smart and there is no

3063
02:04:54,709 --> 02:04:58,039
relationship between being smart and

3064
02:04:56,300 --> 02:05:00,590
being wise they are not the same thing

3065
02:04:58,039 --> 02:05:02,989
there's no quick pathway from smart to

3066
02:05:00,590 --> 02:05:05,570
wise and many of the people who I've

3067
02:05:02,989 --> 02:05:07,400
known who were very wise were what some

3068
02:05:05,570 --> 02:05:10,340
of them were intellectually impaired and

3069
02:05:07,400 --> 02:05:12,260
were still wise you know so it's the

3070
02:05:10,340 --> 02:05:14,090
arrogance that brings up the block and I

3071
02:05:12,260 --> 02:05:16,130
see this for example happening in the

3072
02:05:14,090 --> 02:05:17,689
United States in particular because the

3073
02:05:16,130 --> 02:05:20,209
last time I went down there for example

3074
02:05:17,689 --> 02:05:21,709
I was I had friends down there and and

3075
02:05:20,209 --> 02:05:23,689
some of those friends are very very

3076
02:05:21,709 --> 02:05:26,449
smart people and some of them were

3077
02:05:23,689 --> 02:05:28,010
talking about the Trump voters and they

3078
02:05:26,449 --> 02:05:30,439
were talking about the Trump voters with

3079
02:05:28,010 --> 02:05:32,959
contempt and I thought you better watch

3080
02:05:30,439 --> 02:05:35,539
that because that's 50% of the damn

3081
02:05:32,959 --> 02:05:37,309
population and it might be convenient to

3082
02:05:35,539 --> 02:05:39,650
think that they're stupid and beneath

3083
02:05:37,309 --> 02:05:41,749
you but it's not conducive to a civil

3084
02:05:39,650 --> 02:05:44,929
state and there's no evidence that it's

3085
02:05:41,749 --> 02:05:47,420
true because there isn't a straight line

3086
02:05:44,929 --> 02:05:50,179
between intelligent and wise and so I

3087
02:05:47,420 --> 02:05:52,459
think that if you're if your character

3088
02:05:50,179 --> 02:05:54,889
is developed and you're intelligent

3089
02:05:52,459 --> 02:05:57,409
you can have your siloed creative

3090
02:05:54,889 --> 02:05:59,389
community but you develop enough wisdom

3091
02:05:57,409 --> 02:06:01,159
so that you can see all the things that

3092
02:05:59,389 --> 02:06:03,170
people can do that are of high ethical

3093
02:06:01,159 --> 02:06:05,989
utility that are outside the

3094
02:06:03,170 --> 02:06:07,670
intellectual domain you know and I think

3095
02:06:05,989 --> 02:06:09,730
that's why in the New Testament I think

3096
02:06:07,670 --> 02:06:13,540
that's why Christ is a carpenter

3097
02:06:09,730 --> 02:06:17,090
right because well first of all

3098
02:06:13,540 --> 02:06:18,740
carpenter is one of those jobs that when

3099
02:06:17,090 --> 02:06:20,390
you're dishonest it manifests itself

3100
02:06:18,740 --> 02:06:22,430
immediately because what you build falls

3101
02:06:20,390 --> 02:06:24,260
down and so if you're an honest

3102
02:06:22,430 --> 02:06:25,610
carpenter you build a good house so that

3103
02:06:24,260 --> 02:06:29,210
there's a nice metaphor there but it's

3104
02:06:25,610 --> 02:06:33,530
also it's also a warning in some sense

3105
02:06:29,210 --> 02:06:37,640
against the the equation of intellectual

3106
02:06:33,530 --> 02:06:39,410
brilliance with moral superiority and so

3107
02:06:37,640 --> 02:06:41,900
if the intellects would drop their moral

3108
02:06:39,410 --> 02:06:45,080
superiority and fat chance there is of

3109
02:06:41,900 --> 02:06:48,170
that then that divide between the

3110
02:06:45,080 --> 02:06:52,700
working class say and the elite would

3111
02:06:48,170 --> 02:06:55,790
would resolve and there's every reason

3112
02:06:52,700 --> 02:06:59,270
to have respect for decent working class

3113
02:06:55,790 --> 02:07:02,570
people I mean it's on their labour as

3114
02:06:59,270 --> 02:07:05,180
the left wingers at least hypothetically

3115
02:07:02,570 --> 02:07:09,620
agree that the entire edifice of the

3116
02:07:05,180 --> 02:07:11,750
culture is is resting so you can have

3117
02:07:09,620 --> 02:07:15,020
your cake and eat it too but you have to

3118
02:07:11,750 --> 02:07:18,050
not assume that your niche makes you

3119
02:07:15,020 --> 02:07:20,150
superior and it's very difficult for

3120
02:07:18,050 --> 02:07:23,030
smart people especially smart there's a

3121
02:07:20,150 --> 02:07:25,790
scene in leeches it seems thus spake

3122
02:07:23,030 --> 02:07:26,990
Zarathustra wears arethusa the Prophet

3123
02:07:25,790 --> 02:07:28,940
comes down from the mountain and he

3124
02:07:26,990 --> 02:07:31,250
comes into a public square and there's

3125
02:07:28,940 --> 02:07:32,840
this crowd around this little

3126
02:07:31,250 --> 02:07:37,280
who's only about this high who have a

3127
02:07:32,840 --> 02:07:39,200
gigantic ear and everyone is marveling

3128
02:07:37,280 --> 02:07:41,330
at him well that's what the modern

3129
02:07:39,200 --> 02:07:43,550
intellect is like it's a with a

3130
02:07:41,330 --> 02:07:46,730
giant well mouth generally not an ear

3131
02:07:43,550 --> 02:07:49,790
and the the the being is underdeveloped

3132
02:07:46,730 --> 02:07:51,970
but the intellect is hyper activated and

3133
02:07:49,790 --> 02:07:54,260
and it makes the person extraordinarily

3134
02:07:51,970 --> 02:07:56,000
unbalanced and his part because they

3135
02:07:54,260 --> 02:07:57,830
they can't compete outside the

3136
02:07:56,000 --> 02:07:59,240
intellectual realm and that makes them

3137
02:07:57,830 --> 02:08:00,800
very bitter because they tend to think

3138
02:07:59,240 --> 02:08:02,270
well God I'm so smart everything should

3139
02:08:00,800 --> 02:08:06,020
just come to me it's like sorry that's

3140
02:08:02,270 --> 02:08:09,620
not how the world works and and it also

3141
02:08:06,020 --> 02:08:11,570
that that and that that that attitude is

3142
02:08:09,620 --> 02:08:13,670
immediately evident to people that

3143
02:08:11,570 --> 02:08:15,080
they're talking to when they talk in the

3144
02:08:13,670 --> 02:08:16,880
manner that they talk if they are

3145
02:08:15,080 --> 02:08:18,800
arrogant intellectuals of that sort

3146
02:08:16,880 --> 02:08:21,650
you see that in the Simpsons did a good

3147
02:08:18,800 --> 02:08:22,699
job of that with comic book guy right I

3148
02:08:21,650 --> 02:08:24,290
mean he

3149
02:08:22,699 --> 02:08:27,020
completely useless in every possible

3150
02:08:24,290 --> 02:08:28,910
dimension with an IQ of about 160 and

3151
02:08:27,020 --> 02:08:30,890
it's very annoying to people who have an

3152
02:08:28,910 --> 02:08:33,140
IQ of 160 that they can also be

3153
02:08:30,890 --> 02:08:45,980
completely useless but it happens a lot

3154
02:08:33,140 --> 02:08:48,650
so yeah hi dr. Peterson long time no see

3155
02:08:45,980 --> 02:08:50,510
how are you doing thanks so I was up

3156
02:08:48,650 --> 02:08:52,480
first going to ask about your thoughts

3157
02:08:50,510 --> 02:08:54,949
on a very popular TV show Rick and Marty

3158
02:08:52,480 --> 02:08:56,360
you know someone just recommended that

3159
02:08:54,949 --> 02:08:58,100
to me and they said they thought I would

3160
02:08:56,360 --> 02:09:00,440
find it funny and that makes me nervous

3161
02:08:58,100 --> 02:09:02,270
because I like the Simpsons and I like

3162
02:09:00,440 --> 02:09:04,219
the Trailer Park Boys for actually like

3163
02:09:02,270 --> 02:09:06,590
the trailer I really liked the Trailer

3164
02:09:04,219 --> 02:09:11,690
Park Boys and so someone said I know

3165
02:09:06,590 --> 02:09:13,520
it's so sad you know but they said that

3166
02:09:11,690 --> 02:09:16,610
I would like Rick and Morty so I'm kind

3167
02:09:13,520 --> 02:09:18,710
of afraid to even watch it it does have

3168
02:09:16,610 --> 02:09:20,900
a nihilistic theme to it no I would say

3169
02:09:18,710 --> 02:09:22,910
so that which is quite telling of the

3170
02:09:20,900 --> 02:09:24,500
young population which they flee they

3171
02:09:22,910 --> 02:09:26,270
fall in love with it everyone's talking

3172
02:09:24,500 --> 02:09:27,710
about it so uh-huh okay well I'll

3173
02:09:26,270 --> 02:09:29,390
definitely watch it because I've been

3174
02:09:27,710 --> 02:09:32,960
looking for something to watch when I'm

3175
02:09:29,390 --> 02:09:34,640
brain dead at night so but I decide to

3176
02:09:32,960 --> 02:09:39,710
tell them my question from a different

3177
02:09:34,640 --> 02:09:41,780
angle if I may and it's about the case

3178
02:09:39,710 --> 02:09:45,110
that governments let's say such as

3179
02:09:41,780 --> 02:09:47,989
Russia and Iran they have any more

3180
02:09:45,110 --> 02:09:49,760
extreme cases like Isis they do not want

3181
02:09:47,989 --> 02:09:52,160
to conform to the nihilistic aspects of

3182
02:09:49,760 --> 02:09:54,949
the West as a result they've taken an

3183
02:09:52,160 --> 02:09:56,989
anti-western approach as someone with a

3184
02:09:54,949 --> 02:09:58,610
Middle Eastern background I've been

3185
02:09:56,989 --> 02:10:02,210
trying to figure out where the origins

3186
02:09:58,610 --> 02:10:04,480
of this hostility more precisely comes

3187
02:10:02,210 --> 02:10:08,630
from and why things are the way they are

3188
02:10:04,480 --> 02:10:10,340
I recently found out that certain key

3189
02:10:08,630 --> 02:10:12,380
Iranian philosophers and political

3190
02:10:10,340 --> 02:10:14,870
activists were partially intuitively

3191
02:10:12,380 --> 02:10:18,350
responsible for the 1979 Iranian

3192
02:10:14,870 --> 02:10:20,690
Revolution were highly influenced by the

3193
02:10:18,350 --> 02:10:23,179
anti Western high daguerreian philosophy

3194
02:10:20,690 --> 02:10:26,570
and this is partially why they believed

3195
02:10:23,179 --> 02:10:29,270
that an Islamic state would and it'd be

3196
02:10:26,570 --> 02:10:32,449
messy and necessary counter position to

3197
02:10:29,270 --> 02:10:34,210
the ninth nihilistic Western thought you

3198
02:10:32,449 --> 02:10:35,290
I know that you also come there with

3199
02:10:34,210 --> 02:10:39,070
Alexander

3200
02:10:35,290 --> 02:10:40,360
dooking putting those liza yes except

3201
02:10:39,070 --> 02:10:43,570
Dugan doesn't really seem to have a

3202
02:10:40,360 --> 02:10:45,460
coherent answer he says that an answer

3203
02:10:43,570 --> 02:10:46,780
like that is necessary and that

3204
02:10:45,460 --> 02:10:48,850
hypothetically it's something that

3205
02:10:46,780 --> 02:10:51,010
Russia might be able to offer but the

3206
02:10:48,850 --> 02:10:53,260
details seem to me somewhat obscure I

3207
02:10:51,010 --> 02:10:56,320
mean the Russians maybe the Russians are

3208
02:10:53,260 --> 02:10:57,670
doing what Solzhenitsyn suggested and

3209
02:10:56,320 --> 02:10:59,710
returning to Orthodox Christianity

3210
02:10:57,670 --> 02:11:01,210
although Russia is corrupt enough so

3211
02:10:59,710 --> 02:11:03,490
that it's very difficult to tell from

3212
02:11:01,210 --> 02:11:04,960
the outside if that's mere collusion

3213
02:11:03,490 --> 02:11:06,340
between the corrupt church in a corrupt

3214
02:11:04,960 --> 02:11:09,730
state or if there's something genuine

3215
02:11:06,340 --> 02:11:11,320
going on there now you know the I would

3216
02:11:09,730 --> 02:11:14,190
say there's a question under your

3217
02:11:11,320 --> 02:11:16,990
question which is tyranny or nihilism

3218
02:11:14,190 --> 02:11:19,870
well that's a good question man that's a

3219
02:11:16,990 --> 02:11:22,570
good question well lots of people would

3220
02:11:19,870 --> 02:11:23,980
pick tyranny over nihilism and so if

3221
02:11:22,570 --> 02:11:25,780
that's the only choice that people are

3222
02:11:23,980 --> 02:11:27,280
offered then and I also think that

3223
02:11:25,780 --> 02:11:28,510
tyranny is stronger than nihilism

3224
02:11:27,280 --> 02:11:31,450
because what are you going to do

3225
02:11:28,510 --> 02:11:33,400
organize nihilists hardly well look at

3226
02:11:31,450 --> 02:11:35,830
look at what happened to what was that

3227
02:11:33,400 --> 02:11:38,560
thing in Central Park you know against

3228
02:11:35,830 --> 02:11:41,320
the 1% Jesus I mean what a dismal affair

3229
02:11:38,560 --> 02:11:53,890
that was we'd like things to be

3230
02:11:41,320 --> 02:11:56,530
different how well we don't know like so

3231
02:11:53,890 --> 02:11:58,240
you know you can just run over that if

3232
02:11:56,530 --> 02:11:59,860
you're tyrannical and organized you can

3233
02:11:58,240 --> 02:12:02,380
just run over that like there's nothing

3234
02:11:59,860 --> 02:12:04,240
there at all and that I think there is a

3235
02:12:02,380 --> 02:12:08,770
danger and I do think that we're

3236
02:12:04,240 --> 02:12:11,590
enticing the Islamofascists let's say by

3237
02:12:08,770 --> 02:12:13,120
our nihilistic weakness and I think more

3238
02:12:11,590 --> 02:12:14,290
than that I think that we're doing

3239
02:12:13,120 --> 02:12:15,760
something more than that because one of

3240
02:12:14,290 --> 02:12:17,590
the things that I've been curious about

3241
02:12:15,760 --> 02:12:19,300
and I'm going way out on a limb here is

3242
02:12:17,590 --> 02:12:21,160
I've been really interested in the

3243
02:12:19,300 --> 02:12:23,140
alliance between the neo-marxist

3244
02:12:21,160 --> 02:12:25,150
nihilistic are the neo-marxist

3245
02:12:23,140 --> 02:12:27,940
postmodernists especially the feminists

3246
02:12:25,150 --> 02:12:30,100
and the Islamofascists I just don't get

3247
02:12:27,940 --> 02:12:32,200
that it's like there's something very

3248
02:12:30,100 --> 02:12:34,450
very interesting going on there and I

3249
02:12:32,200 --> 02:12:37,750
think part of it is that when you when

3250
02:12:34,450 --> 02:12:40,750
you drift too far into the nihilistic

3251
02:12:37,750 --> 02:12:42,580
sub structure there's a huge call for

3252
02:12:40,750 --> 02:12:45,040
tyrannical order that manifests itself

3253
02:12:42,580 --> 02:12:47,830
unconsciously and so that's the dynamic

3254
02:12:45,040 --> 02:12:49,220
that I see playing out in that peculiar

3255
02:12:47,830 --> 02:12:52,240
relationship between the

3256
02:12:49,220 --> 02:12:58,100
modern neo-marxist feminists and

3257
02:12:52,240 --> 02:12:59,990
Islamofascists I don't I don't know

3258
02:12:58,100 --> 02:13:03,170
that's a very that's very interesting

3259
02:12:59,990 --> 02:13:05,180
that that's a very interesting idea that

3260
02:13:03,170 --> 02:13:06,560
you brought to mind I had no idea that

3261
02:13:05,180 --> 02:13:08,810
there was a relationship between

3262
02:13:06,560 --> 02:13:11,360
Heidegger and what happened in Iran in

3263
02:13:08,810 --> 02:13:13,610
the 1970s if you could send me a

3264
02:13:11,360 --> 02:13:15,500
citation about that or something to read

3265
02:13:13,610 --> 02:13:17,860
I'd be very interested in doing that so

3266
02:13:15,500 --> 02:13:26,020
okay yep yep

3267
02:13:17,860 --> 02:13:31,160
[Applause]

3268
02:13:26,020 --> 02:13:32,960
thank you that's that's that's the

3269
02:13:31,160 --> 02:13:34,910
closest thing I think I'll experienced

3270
02:13:32,960 --> 02:14:01,760
it out to arnold schwarzenegger actually

3271
02:13:34,910 --> 02:14:04,970
delivering that line yeah the purrito

3272
02:14:01,760 --> 02:14:16,730
distribution yeah yeah yeah not Ross but

3273
02:14:04,970 --> 02:14:18,920
yeah do you have to work oh it's a nasty

3274
02:14:16,730 --> 02:14:29,950
it's a nasty law yeah it was also known

3275
02:14:18,920 --> 02:14:29,950
as prices law yeah yeah yeah yeah great

3276
02:14:34,420 --> 02:14:43,300
yeah yeah yeah

3277
02:14:54,420 --> 02:15:02,620
hopefully there's fewer of them than

3278
02:14:56,530 --> 02:15:06,040
that okay two to two things the first is

3279
02:15:02,620 --> 02:15:08,650
it isn't obvious what the population

3280
02:15:06,040 --> 02:15:09,670
would be that you would compare this

3281
02:15:08,650 --> 02:15:11,679
population to

3282
02:15:09,670 --> 02:15:13,090
right because you could say well the

3283
02:15:11,679 --> 02:15:14,530
boundary is the four hundred people in

3284
02:15:13,090 --> 02:15:15,790
this room but it isn't necessarily the

3285
02:15:14,530 --> 02:15:18,730
case the four hundred people in this

3286
02:15:15,790 --> 02:15:20,380
room might be the square root of the

3287
02:15:18,730 --> 02:15:21,880
broader population we're interested in

3288
02:15:20,380 --> 02:15:23,500
this sort of thing but with the purrito

3289
02:15:21,880 --> 02:15:29,679
distribution what you also see is that

3290
02:15:23,500 --> 02:15:31,330
it's it's self similar and so let's say

3291
02:15:29,679 --> 02:15:32,739
there's four hundred people doing

3292
02:15:31,330 --> 02:15:35,620
something twenty of them are doing half

3293
02:15:32,739 --> 02:15:37,000
the work but if you take twenty four of

3294
02:15:35,620 --> 02:15:38,620
them are doing half the work of the

3295
02:15:37,000 --> 02:15:44,590
twenty and one of the four is doing half

3296
02:15:38,620 --> 02:15:47,860
the work of the four and so it's so why

3297
02:15:44,590 --> 02:15:49,510
am I telling you that it's it isn't it

3298
02:15:47,860 --> 02:15:52,540
well first of all it isn't that there

3299
02:15:49,510 --> 02:15:54,969
isn't useful work to be done at multiple

3300
02:15:52,540 --> 02:15:56,770
slices of the purrito distribution but

3301
02:15:54,969 --> 02:15:57,940
the other thing is it's also the case

3302
02:15:56,770 --> 02:16:00,489
that there's not only one purrito

3303
02:15:57,940 --> 02:16:02,199
distribution right because you might say

3304
02:16:00,489 --> 02:16:03,640
well if it's just the square root of the

3305
02:16:02,199 --> 02:16:05,290
number of people in a domain that are

3306
02:16:03,640 --> 02:16:06,159
doing half the work then you know what

3307
02:16:05,290 --> 02:16:07,690
do you do with the rest of the people

3308
02:16:06,159 --> 02:16:09,909
and the answer that might be well

3309
02:16:07,690 --> 02:16:11,800
they're in a prio different preeto

3310
02:16:09,909 --> 02:16:15,600
distribution as well where they're doing

3311
02:16:11,800 --> 02:16:15,600
something productive so

3312
02:16:21,960 --> 02:16:27,040
well I think it's a good question like

3313
02:16:24,700 --> 02:16:29,140
we don't exactly end so so the basic

3314
02:16:27,040 --> 02:16:31,450
rule is the look the basic rule is for

3315
02:16:29,140 --> 02:16:33,460
example if you take a hundred scientists

3316
02:16:31,450 --> 02:16:36,219
in a given domain ten of them will have

3317
02:16:33,460 --> 02:16:38,530
published half the papers and this works

3318
02:16:36,219 --> 02:16:41,800
with everything it works with with every

3319
02:16:38,530 --> 02:16:43,450
creative domain the rule applies so now

3320
02:16:41,800 --> 02:16:44,980
the question is why and I think the

3321
02:16:43,450 --> 02:16:46,240
choir the answer to that seems to be and

3322
02:16:44,980 --> 02:16:47,950
I've watched people who become

3323
02:16:46,240 --> 02:16:51,700
spectacular ly successful it what

3324
02:16:47,950 --> 02:16:52,630
happens is that zero is a really bad

3325
02:16:51,700 --> 02:16:55,059
place to be

3326
02:16:52,630 --> 02:16:57,340
right it's really hard to get out of

3327
02:16:55,059 --> 02:16:59,440
zero and that's often why people are

3328
02:16:57,340 --> 02:17:01,960
trapped in poverty because if you have

3329
02:16:59,440 --> 02:17:03,550
nothing getting to something is

3330
02:17:01,960 --> 02:17:05,110
virtually impossible once you have

3331
02:17:03,550 --> 02:17:06,760
something getting to a little more of

3332
02:17:05,110 --> 02:17:11,950
something is actually quite a bit easier

3333
02:17:06,760 --> 02:17:14,740
and so what seems to happen this is also

3334
02:17:11,950 --> 02:17:16,030
called the Mathieu principle right it's

3335
02:17:14,740 --> 02:17:19,840
the same principle so that's a New

3336
02:17:16,030 --> 02:17:22,300
Testament citation let's say the Mathieu

3337
02:17:19,840 --> 02:17:24,910
principle is to those who have

3338
02:17:22,300 --> 02:17:27,070
everything more will be given from those

3339
02:17:24,910 --> 02:17:28,840
who have nothing everything will be

3340
02:17:27,070 --> 02:17:30,160
taken that's another one of those lines

3341
02:17:28,840 --> 02:17:31,510
in the New Testament that you'd think

3342
02:17:30,160 --> 02:17:34,179
that a good editor would have just got

3343
02:17:31,510 --> 02:17:36,219
rid of so but but but I think what it is

3344
02:17:34,179 --> 02:17:38,980
is that every time you make a step

3345
02:17:36,219 --> 02:17:39,880
forward the probability that you'll be

3346
02:17:38,980 --> 02:17:42,160
able to take the next step forward

3347
02:17:39,880 --> 02:17:46,270
increases and it seems to increase in a

3348
02:17:42,160 --> 02:17:48,460
nonlinear way so the the world that the

3349
02:17:46,270 --> 02:17:50,230
Mathieu principle describes is nonlinear

3350
02:17:48,460 --> 02:17:51,940
you know so you might say well what's

3351
02:17:50,230 --> 02:17:56,230
your trajectory if you're moving upward

3352
02:17:51,940 --> 02:17:57,700
well it's not this it's this what's your

3353
02:17:56,230 --> 02:18:02,410
trajectory if you're moving downward

3354
02:17:57,700 --> 02:18:06,280
it's not this it's this right you fall

3355
02:18:02,410 --> 02:18:08,889
you fall you plummet you rise you rise

3356
02:18:06,280 --> 02:18:10,090
you transcend it's something like that

3357
02:18:08,889 --> 02:18:12,880
and you might say well that's a hell of

3358
02:18:10,090 --> 02:18:14,410
a world but whatever it has to be run by

3359
02:18:12,880 --> 02:18:21,780
some principle and that's the principle

3360
02:18:14,410 --> 02:18:21,780
that it appears to be run by yes

3361
02:18:24,380 --> 02:18:30,030
no no no it doesn't mean that at all

3362
02:18:26,880 --> 02:18:32,340
what it means is that every truth claim

3363
02:18:30,030 --> 02:18:35,280
you make including those that are

3364
02:18:32,340 --> 02:18:38,429
implicit in your actions carries with it

3365
02:18:35,280 --> 02:18:41,160
an ethic that justifies or doesn't

3366
02:18:38,429 --> 02:18:43,950
justify the action so for example let's

3367
02:18:41,160 --> 02:18:46,920
say I have a tool and I say it's an axe

3368
02:18:43,950 --> 02:18:48,540
and I go to the forest and I cut down I

3369
02:18:46,920 --> 02:18:51,809
try to cut down a tree with it and it

3370
02:18:48,540 --> 02:18:53,760
doesn't work it's not an axe it's

3371
02:18:51,809 --> 02:18:56,389
something else and so what the what

3372
02:18:53,760 --> 02:18:58,920
there's a good book on pragmatism called

3373
02:18:56,389 --> 02:19:00,540
the metaphysical Club a history of

3374
02:18:58,920 --> 02:19:02,519
American ideas it's what I would really

3375
02:19:00,540 --> 02:19:03,960
recommend and what the pragmatists I

3376
02:19:02,519 --> 02:19:05,490
can't give you a full answer because

3377
02:19:03,960 --> 02:19:07,469
this is such a complicated issue but

3378
02:19:05,490 --> 02:19:11,910
what the pragmatists were wrestling with

3379
02:19:07,469 --> 02:19:13,710
back in the late 1800s the late 1800s

3380
02:19:11,910 --> 02:19:15,689
this was William James and his crew in

3381
02:19:13,710 --> 02:19:18,030
in Boston

3382
02:19:15,689 --> 02:19:19,500
including a philosopher named CS purse

3383
02:19:18,030 --> 02:19:22,649
who was perhaps America's greatest

3384
02:19:19,500 --> 02:19:24,210
philosopher they were wrestling with the

3385
02:19:22,649 --> 02:19:27,649
same issue that the postmodernist would

3386
02:19:24,210 --> 02:19:30,210
wrestle with 100 years later which is

3387
02:19:27,649 --> 02:19:32,280
things are indefinitely complex and

3388
02:19:30,210 --> 02:19:34,319
we're not very bright so how is it that

3389
02:19:32,280 --> 02:19:37,229
we can make claims to truth about

3390
02:19:34,319 --> 02:19:39,300
anything and what they were what their

3391
02:19:37,229 --> 02:19:41,429
their hypothesis essentially was is that

3392
02:19:39,300 --> 02:19:43,649
with every action and with every truth

3393
02:19:41,429 --> 02:19:45,990
claim you simultaneously demarcate a

3394
02:19:43,649 --> 02:19:49,290
territory within which that claim is

3395
02:19:45,990 --> 02:19:51,180
valid and you you determine whether the

3396
02:19:49,290 --> 02:19:53,100
claim is valid by noting whether your

3397
02:19:51,180 --> 02:19:55,280
prediction about the outcome of your

3398
02:19:53,100 --> 02:19:59,670
action or your or your belief is

3399
02:19:55,280 --> 02:20:01,740
commencer is is in keeping with if the

3400
02:19:59,670 --> 02:20:04,350
outcome is in keeping with the

3401
02:20:01,740 --> 02:20:07,500
prediction then what you've said or done

3402
02:20:04,350 --> 02:20:09,540
is true or good enough and that's as

3403
02:20:07,500 --> 02:20:11,939
good as you get and so that's the

3404
02:20:09,540 --> 02:20:14,280
pragmatic perspective and then when when

3405
02:20:11,939 --> 02:20:17,399
when the pragmatist encountered charles

3406
02:20:14,280 --> 02:20:19,560
dark charles darwin's works works they

3407
02:20:17,399 --> 02:20:21,750
immediately recognized that darwin had

3408
02:20:19,560 --> 02:20:23,760
generated a pragmatic solution to the

3409
02:20:21,750 --> 02:20:26,010
problem of the impossibility of being

3410
02:20:23,760 --> 02:20:28,890
the impossibility of being is this

3411
02:20:26,010 --> 02:20:31,890
there's way more cosmos than there is

3412
02:20:28,890 --> 02:20:34,320
you you are going to die you cannot

3413
02:20:31,890 --> 02:20:37,681
generate a sufficient solution

3414
02:20:34,320 --> 02:20:40,261
to the problem of your being no one can

3415
02:20:37,681 --> 02:20:42,391
nothing can it's like the environment is

3416
02:20:40,261 --> 02:20:43,710
a snake that moves unpredictably across

3417
02:20:42,391 --> 02:20:46,110
time and you're trying to stay on its

3418
02:20:43,710 --> 02:20:48,391
back well as how how does the Darwinian

3419
02:20:46,110 --> 02:20:50,700
process deal with that it produces

3420
02:20:48,391 --> 02:20:54,570
infinite variance roughly speaking

3421
02:20:50,700 --> 02:20:56,130
almost all of which die and that's how

3422
02:20:54,570 --> 02:20:58,561
it solves the problem across time and

3423
02:20:56,130 --> 02:21:01,740
the things that exist is the things that

3424
02:20:58,561 --> 02:21:03,181
stay alive are true enough and that's

3425
02:21:01,740 --> 02:21:04,380
the best you get that's the argument I

3426
02:21:03,181 --> 02:21:05,910
was trying to have with Sam Harris

3427
02:21:04,380 --> 02:21:07,620
because Harris doesn't take his

3428
02:21:05,910 --> 02:21:09,660
evolutionary cycle is a Volusia nary

3429
02:21:07,620 --> 02:21:12,120
theory seriously enough but we get to

3430
02:21:09,660 --> 02:21:17,250
kept getting bogged down anyways that's

3431
02:21:12,120 --> 02:21:20,330
that's the best answer oh I'd like to

3432
02:21:17,250 --> 02:21:20,330
agree with that but it's not true

3433
02:21:22,130 --> 02:21:44,400
yeah yep yep yep you really do like to

3434
02:21:41,040 --> 02:21:47,340
ask hard questions so you I think it

3435
02:21:44,400 --> 02:21:49,590
depends see this is also why like the pH

3436
02:21:47,340 --> 02:21:52,380
alien take let's say on on pragmatism

3437
02:21:49,590 --> 02:21:55,110
because I think that pragmatism as a

3438
02:21:52,380 --> 02:21:57,721
philosophy has the limitation that you

3439
02:21:55,110 --> 02:22:00,210
just described but only if you think

3440
02:21:57,721 --> 02:22:01,700
about the games as limited if you have

3441
02:22:00,210 --> 02:22:05,400
to play the game in an iterative way

3442
02:22:01,700 --> 02:22:06,750
then that issue resolves itself and the

3443
02:22:05,400 --> 02:22:09,540
game theorists have done a good job of

3444
02:22:06,750 --> 02:22:11,521
mapping that out it's like you could say

3445
02:22:09,540 --> 02:22:13,051
let's say pragmatically speaking there's

3446
02:22:11,521 --> 02:22:14,130
no reason I shouldn't deceive you once

3447
02:22:13,051 --> 02:22:17,011
if I can get what I want

3448
02:22:14,130 --> 02:22:18,870
it's yeah yeah except that I'm probably

3449
02:22:17,011 --> 02:22:20,880
not only going to interact with you once

3450
02:22:18,870 --> 02:22:22,681
I'm going to interact with you a lot and

3451
02:22:20,880 --> 02:22:24,301
even if it isn't you that I interact

3452
02:22:22,681 --> 02:22:25,771
with it's going to be a bunch of beings

3453
02:22:24,301 --> 02:22:28,620
that are so much like you that it might

3454
02:22:25,771 --> 02:22:30,650
as well be you might as well be you it's

3455
02:22:28,620 --> 02:22:34,021
going to be me if nothing else and so

3456
02:22:30,650 --> 02:22:36,210
the pragmatic game stretched across time

3457
02:22:34,021 --> 02:22:39,301
would include the necessity of

3458
02:22:36,210 --> 02:22:41,521
iterability in relationship to the

3459
02:22:39,301 --> 02:22:45,279
validations of the truth claims that's

3460
02:22:41,521 --> 02:22:49,709
that's how it looks to me

3461
02:22:45,279 --> 02:22:59,560
I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna stop you

3462
02:22:49,709 --> 02:23:12,129
if we have say that again yes yes thank

3463
02:22:59,560 --> 02:23:14,560
you yes but that's not all I am so this

3464
02:23:12,129 --> 02:23:16,149
is on behalf of somebody dr. Peterson

3465
02:23:14,560 --> 02:23:17,680
having listened to your expositions on

3466
02:23:16,149 --> 02:23:19,810
the mythological evolution and

3467
02:23:17,680 --> 02:23:21,909
amalgamation of religion and keeping in

3468
02:23:19,810 --> 02:23:24,010
mind your working definitions of belief

3469
02:23:21,909 --> 02:23:25,419
and truth and despite the obvious

3470
02:23:24,010 --> 02:23:28,060
reasons for somebody of your background

3471
02:23:25,419 --> 02:23:29,560
to identify most with Christianity my

3472
02:23:28,060 --> 02:23:31,449
understanding is that you believe

3473
02:23:29,560 --> 02:23:33,369
Christianity to be the most complete and

3474
02:23:31,449 --> 02:23:35,409
articulated form of many of the

3475
02:23:33,369 --> 02:23:37,329
metaphysical ideas that preceded it and

3476
02:23:35,409 --> 02:23:38,949
led up to that keeping that in mind

3477
02:23:37,329 --> 02:23:40,899
would it also be accurate to therefore

3478
02:23:38,949 --> 02:23:43,930
say that you're not only a believer in

3479
02:23:40,899 --> 02:23:46,930
Christianity but also if to a lesser

3480
02:23:43,930 --> 02:23:48,459
degree also believer in in Mourdock in

3481
02:23:46,930 --> 02:23:49,869
the ancient Egyptian gods and the

3482
02:23:48,459 --> 02:23:51,729
subsequent gods that you've spoken up

3483
02:23:49,869 --> 02:23:53,619
here that led up and contribute it to

3484
02:23:51,729 --> 02:23:56,279
the form of Christianity that you're

3485
02:23:53,619 --> 02:23:58,600
discussing and that you identify with

3486
02:23:56,279 --> 02:24:03,010
okay I'm going to take that one apart a

3487
02:23:58,600 --> 02:24:04,659
little bit I'm bounded in my judgment

3488
02:24:03,010 --> 02:24:10,629
with regards to Christianity by my

3489
02:24:04,659 --> 02:24:14,979
ignorance I'm no student of Hinduism so

3490
02:24:10,629 --> 02:24:16,959
I can't make the claim forthrightly that

3491
02:24:14,979 --> 02:24:20,199
there's something intrinsically superior

3492
02:24:16,959 --> 02:24:22,229
to the judeo-christian tradition because

3493
02:24:20,199 --> 02:24:24,850
I don't know enough to make that claim

3494
02:24:22,229 --> 02:24:27,459
the claim I can make is that there's

3495
02:24:24,850 --> 02:24:28,659
something that's dreadfully right about

3496
02:24:27,459 --> 02:24:30,819
this core elements of the

3497
02:24:28,659 --> 02:24:32,589
judeo-christian tradition and I've seen

3498
02:24:30,819 --> 02:24:35,369
analogues to that like one of the things

3499
02:24:32,589 --> 02:24:38,589
I'd like to do for example is to do a

3500
02:24:35,369 --> 02:24:41,260
short series on the Delta H Inc because

3501
02:24:38,589 --> 02:24:43,209
that is one remarkable document once you

3502
02:24:41,260 --> 02:24:44,799
know especially you might want to read

3503
02:24:43,209 --> 02:24:50,560
it you can go online and read it's very

3504
02:24:44,799 --> 02:24:52,720
short out etching ta o teh CH ing and

3505
02:24:50,560 --> 02:24:55,600
it's the fundamental text of Taoism and

3506
02:24:52,720 --> 02:24:58,060
once you know that the world of being is

3507
02:24:55,600 --> 02:24:59,140
made of chaos and order and you know

3508
02:24:58,060 --> 02:25:00,850
that that's represented

3509
02:24:59,140 --> 02:25:02,319
by the yin and the yang all of a sudden

3510
02:25:00,850 --> 02:25:06,130
you can understand the DAO de Jing and

3511
02:25:02,319 --> 02:25:08,380
it's just it's brilliantly simple and

3512
02:25:06,130 --> 02:25:09,819
straightforward in it's exposition but

3513
02:25:08,380 --> 02:25:13,120
it also seems to me to be entirely

3514
02:25:09,819 --> 02:25:16,000
commensurate with the line of of let's

3515
02:25:13,120 --> 02:25:17,850
call it logic it's more like a the the

3516
02:25:16,000 --> 02:25:20,470
mode of description of being that's

3517
02:25:17,850 --> 02:25:22,029
encapsulated in these stories now with

3518
02:25:20,470 --> 02:25:23,920
regards to being a believer people ask

3519
02:25:22,029 --> 02:25:25,840
me all the time two things say do you

3520
02:25:23,920 --> 02:25:27,399
believe in God and are you a Christian

3521
02:25:25,840 --> 02:25:29,229
and they answered without both of those

3522
02:25:27,399 --> 02:25:30,850
is actually there's two answers one is

3523
02:25:29,229 --> 02:25:31,720
what the hell makes you think it's any

3524
02:25:30,850 --> 02:25:33,939
of your business

3525
02:25:31,720 --> 02:25:36,760
that's the first answer and the second

3526
02:25:33,939 --> 02:25:38,409
is why do you think that you mean the

3527
02:25:36,760 --> 02:25:40,960
same thing with those questions that I

3528
02:25:38,409 --> 02:25:43,090
would mean with my answer so you know

3529
02:25:40,960 --> 02:25:45,640
what because it's such a funny thing

3530
02:25:43,090 --> 02:25:47,380
because I spent like three and this is

3531
02:25:45,640 --> 02:25:48,939
no accusation with regards to your

3532
02:25:47,380 --> 02:25:49,989
questions in the least you know I think

3533
02:25:48,939 --> 02:25:51,729
it's more about trying to detract the

3534
02:25:49,989 --> 02:25:53,830
development of these ideas and you know

3535
02:25:51,729 --> 02:25:55,689
the residual truth and so yeah

3536
02:25:53,830 --> 02:25:57,359
psychological significance of all these

3537
02:25:55,689 --> 02:25:59,920
other traditions I think well you know I

3538
02:25:57,359 --> 02:26:03,640
did I've been there

3539
02:25:59,920 --> 02:26:06,430
floored by other mythological structures

3540
02:26:03,640 --> 02:26:08,290
like when I first understood or thought

3541
02:26:06,430 --> 02:26:10,870
I understood the meaning of the

3542
02:26:08,290 --> 02:26:13,120
Mesopotamian creation method just I've

3543
02:26:10,870 --> 02:26:15,370
never recovered from that I would say

3544
02:26:13,120 --> 02:26:17,260
and the same thing is true of the

3545
02:26:15,370 --> 02:26:20,680
investigations I did into the Egyptian

3546
02:26:17,260 --> 02:26:24,069
myths of Horus and Isis and Osiris and

3547
02:26:20,680 --> 02:26:25,870
Seth it's just a and they're they're so

3548
02:26:24,069 --> 02:26:30,250
relevant I mean they're so unbelievably

3549
02:26:25,870 --> 02:26:31,810
relevant and how do how do see this is a

3550
02:26:30,250 --> 02:26:34,540
problem that none of us really know how

3551
02:26:31,810 --> 02:26:36,640
to solve it's like they're our sources

3552
02:26:34,540 --> 02:26:39,880
of wisdom all over the world let's say

3553
02:26:36,640 --> 02:26:42,220
and they need to be made commensurate

3554
02:26:39,880 --> 02:26:44,279
with one another which isn't to say that

3555
02:26:42,220 --> 02:26:46,449
they need to be turned into a fast-food

3556
02:26:44,279 --> 02:26:48,939
mall you know that's that's like

3557
02:26:46,449 --> 02:26:51,399
multiculturalism right it's like all the

3558
02:26:48,939 --> 02:26:53,439
food of the world served in the most

3559
02:26:51,399 --> 02:26:53,949
terrible possible manner all in one

3560
02:26:53,439 --> 02:26:55,420
place

3561
02:26:53,949 --> 02:26:56,620
and something like that and you don't

3562
02:26:55,420 --> 02:26:58,930
want to do that with comparative

3563
02:26:56,620 --> 02:27:00,790
religion it's just water everything down

3564
02:26:58,930 --> 02:27:03,310
and say well it's all nice it's like no

3565
02:27:00,790 --> 02:27:05,710
it is not nice yeah or that it's all the

3566
02:27:03,310 --> 02:27:09,550
same because it's not all the same so

3567
02:27:05,710 --> 02:27:12,601
the the job of communicating between

3568
02:27:09,550 --> 02:27:14,440
those domains of wisdom is really

3569
02:27:12,601 --> 02:27:15,971
continuing right it's been a problem

3570
02:27:14,440 --> 02:27:18,580
ever since the beginning of civilization

3571
02:27:15,971 --> 02:27:20,620
but it's continuing and I would say the

3572
02:27:18,580 --> 02:27:24,580
psychoanalyst Jung in particular was

3573
02:27:20,620 --> 02:27:26,200
took to huge huge steps in in the

3574
02:27:24,580 --> 02:27:28,360
direction of doing that an

3575
02:27:26,200 --> 02:27:30,311
extraordinarily positive way and not a

3576
02:27:28,360 --> 02:27:32,410
simple minded way at all and not just

3577
02:27:30,311 --> 02:27:35,381
hand waving that oh well it's everyone

3578
02:27:32,410 --> 02:27:46,181
has one and all shall have prizes not

3579
02:27:35,381 --> 02:27:47,650
that so yeah last question I choose it

3580
02:27:46,181 --> 02:27:49,900
kind of in the same vein but it's in

3581
02:27:47,650 --> 02:27:52,721
regards to another kind of mythology so

3582
02:27:49,900 --> 02:27:55,511
yeah in terms of I guess Carl Jung's own

3583
02:27:52,721 --> 02:27:59,141
with us sorry I'm extremely tall but a

3584
02:27:55,511 --> 02:28:01,450
lot of the I achieved I found some kind

3585
02:27:59,141 --> 02:28:03,580
of archetypes like for example in my own

3586
02:28:01,450 --> 02:28:06,971
life but also I've noticed in European

3587
02:28:03,580 --> 02:28:09,820
life so for example in regards to Odin

3588
02:28:06,971 --> 02:28:12,610
and Norse mythology yeah with Corleone

3589
02:28:09,820 --> 02:28:14,200
si I've only been able to actually skim

3590
02:28:12,610 --> 02:28:15,521
it because I've been like trying to find

3591
02:28:14,200 --> 02:28:17,440
something like because I felt like

3592
02:28:15,521 --> 02:28:20,080
there's always this kind of psyche that

3593
02:28:17,440 --> 02:28:22,870
was almost underneath I guess Western

3594
02:28:20,080 --> 02:28:25,360
civilization and we see it really like

3595
02:28:22,870 --> 02:28:27,700
embodied in this specific figure this

3596
02:28:25,360 --> 02:28:30,730
deity the wanderer the knowledge

3597
02:28:27,700 --> 02:28:32,711
gatherer the seeker but he's also a war

3598
02:28:30,730 --> 02:28:34,601
goddess these all these different

3599
02:28:32,711 --> 02:28:37,421
aspects that are an accumulation of what

3600
02:28:34,601 --> 02:28:38,771
seems to be something that's distinctly

3601
02:28:37,421 --> 02:28:41,320
Western mm-hm

3602
02:28:38,771 --> 02:28:43,900
and I feel this is like almost like this

3603
02:28:41,320 --> 02:28:45,881
symbol in a way of course it's not

3604
02:28:43,900 --> 02:28:48,101
always followed there seems to be

3605
02:28:45,881 --> 02:28:50,921
something maybe there seems to be

3606
02:28:48,101 --> 02:28:53,681
something I do think that the idea of

3607
02:28:50,921 --> 02:28:55,900
the individual has been articulated most

3608
02:28:53,681 --> 02:28:58,181
fully in the West I don't think that's

3609
02:28:55,900 --> 02:29:02,230
really a I don't think that's a

3610
02:28:58,181 --> 02:29:05,021
contentious claim actually that doesn't

3611
02:29:02,230 --> 02:29:07,001
mean that the latent structures from

3612
02:29:05,021 --> 02:29:08,921
which that idea might emerge weren't

3613
02:29:07,001 --> 02:29:11,771
also many other places simultaneously

3614
02:29:08,921 --> 02:29:13,480
and the other thing from let's say from

3615
02:29:11,771 --> 02:29:15,221
a biological perspective is that we're

3616
02:29:13,480 --> 02:29:17,261
only talking about differences of a few

3617
02:29:15,221 --> 02:29:19,150
hundred years in terms of the

3618
02:29:17,261 --> 02:29:21,160
manifestation of these ideas right from

3619
02:29:19,150 --> 02:29:22,631
from an evolutionary perspective that's

3620
02:29:21,160 --> 02:29:24,730
it's instantaneous

3621
02:29:22,631 --> 02:29:25,860
it's like well a new idea has to arise

3622
02:29:24,730 --> 02:29:28,170
somewhere so

3623
02:29:25,860 --> 02:29:30,210
is going to be somewhere first and but

3624
02:29:28,170 --> 02:29:31,740
it's spreading I mean Christianity for

3625
02:29:30,210 --> 02:29:33,330
example spread so rapidly that it's

3626
02:29:31,740 --> 02:29:34,980
absolutely beyond belief and it is

3627
02:29:33,330 --> 02:29:36,570
actually spreading more rapidly in China

3628
02:29:34,980 --> 02:29:39,391
now than it did in ancient Rome

3629
02:29:36,570 --> 02:29:42,000
so well in regards to that it's also

3630
02:29:39,391 --> 02:29:43,980
been seen like almost in the wake of a

3631
02:29:42,000 --> 02:29:46,141
dying Christianity I've noted that like

3632
02:29:43,980 --> 02:29:49,051
there's been a tendency to go towards I

3633
02:29:46,141 --> 02:29:51,480
guess paganism right yes I understand

3634
02:29:49,051 --> 02:29:53,490
the like some people laugh at all yes we

3635
02:29:51,480 --> 02:29:55,830
have Wicca which was mainly a

3636
02:29:53,490 --> 02:29:57,900
manifestation of Aleister Crowley in his

3637
02:29:55,830 --> 02:29:59,450
works which were then ended off to

3638
02:29:57,900 --> 02:30:02,130
whoever actually made the actual

3639
02:29:59,450 --> 02:30:04,141
ideology and then next thing you know

3640
02:30:02,130 --> 02:30:07,261
we're finding something almost more

3641
02:30:04,141 --> 02:30:08,761
stable in I guess Norse mythology and it

3642
02:30:07,261 --> 02:30:11,730
seems like it's acting almost as a

3643
02:30:08,761 --> 02:30:14,431
pendulum school swing from something

3644
02:30:11,730 --> 02:30:16,620
that well people are good like the thing

3645
02:30:14,431 --> 02:30:18,960
is is when one when one mythological

3646
02:30:16,620 --> 02:30:20,490
structure collapses it's going to

3647
02:30:18,960 --> 02:30:22,440
collapse into another mythological

3648
02:30:20,490 --> 02:30:25,740
structure or another set of mythological

3649
02:30:22,440 --> 02:30:27,420
structures and and because you can't get

3650
02:30:25,740 --> 02:30:28,830
out of the mythological structures

3651
02:30:27,420 --> 02:30:31,710
there's no possible way of doing that

3652
02:30:28,830 --> 02:30:34,200
what and so I wouldn't say necessarily

3653
02:30:31,710 --> 02:30:36,301
that the fact that other belief systems

3654
02:30:34,200 --> 02:30:38,101
emerge in the aftermath of the collapse

3655
02:30:36,301 --> 02:30:39,391
of the overarching belief system I don't

3656
02:30:38,101 --> 02:30:42,301
think that that's necessarily a bad idea

3657
02:30:39,391 --> 02:30:46,051
I think that it has its attendant

3658
02:30:42,301 --> 02:30:47,910
dangers and so I should stop because I'm

3659
02:30:46,051 --> 02:30:49,650
starting to get tired and I'm not going

3660
02:30:47,910 --> 02:30:51,511
to be able to formulate any clearer

3661
02:30:49,650 --> 02:30:55,370
answers than that and it's also 10

3662
02:30:51,511 --> 02:30:55,370
o'clock so we also do have to stop

3663
02:30:57,131 --> 02:31:05,021
oh yes there is an unofficial Meetup and
