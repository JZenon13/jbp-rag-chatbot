00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:20,390
[Music]

3
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:23,280
all right so the last time I was here

4
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:25,710
many of you were as well we got halfway

5
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:28,820
through the story of Jacob and I've been

6
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:31,860
digging underneath the story

7
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:33,180
sporadically since then to try to find

8
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:35,580
out whether other themes are being

9
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:36,870
developed and I've got some things that

10
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:42,390
I think are really interesting to talk

11
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:45,559
about so so we'll get right into it so

12
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:49,670
I'm gonna review a little bit first so

13
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:53,489
we were talking about Jacob and I'll

14
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:55,380
read eight his biography a little bit so

15
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:58,350
that we can place ourselves in the

16
00:00:55,380 --> 00:01:00,930
proper context before we go on so his

17
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:03,329
mother Rebecca gave birth to twins and

18
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:05,520
the twins even in her womb were

19
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:07,350
struggling for although they were

20
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,490
struggling and of course the story is

21
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:11,100
that they were struggling for dominance

22
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:13,350
the older are the younger against the

23
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:18,840
older really because Jacob Jacob means

24
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:21,619
usurper and Rebecca had a what would you

25
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:26,580
call a vision from God that said that

26
00:01:21,619 --> 00:01:29,340
Jacob would supplant Esau and so even

27
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:31,439
before her twins were born they were in

28
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:34,260
a state of competition and that's a

29
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:36,330
recapitulation of the motif of the

30
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:39,570
hostile brothers right it's a very very

31
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:42,270
very common mythological motif and we we

32
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:44,250
already saw that really well developed

33
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:46,380
in the story of Cain and Abel right and

34
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:48,509
Cain and Abel were essentially the first

35
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:50,520
two human beings the first two natural

36
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:52,650
born human beings and they were

37
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:56,369
instantly locked in a state of enmity

38
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:59,310
which is symbolic of first the enmity

39
00:01:56,369 --> 00:02:02,009
that exists within people's psyche

40
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:03,930
between the part of them you might say

41
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:05,220
that's aiming at the light and the part

42
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:07,290
of them that's aiming at the darkness

43
00:02:05,220 --> 00:02:10,259
and I think that's a reasonable way of

44
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:14,610
portraying it obviously it's a way that

45
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:17,940
sort of rife with symbolism but my

46
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:19,560
experience of people especially when you

47
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:21,060
get to know them seriously or when

48
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,640
they're dealing with serious issues is

49
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:25,829
that there is quite clearly a part of

50
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:28,260
them that's striving to do well in the

51
00:02:25,829 --> 00:02:29,580
world or even to do good and another

52
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:31,980
part that's deeply sinned

53
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:34,260
and embittered that that says to hell

54
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:37,590
with it and is self-destructive and

55
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:42,060
lashes out and really aims at making

56
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:44,360
things worse and so that seems to be a

57
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:47,940
natural part of the human psyche and

58
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:50,340
that's also reflected in the the idea of

59
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:52,830
the fall and so those ideas are not

60
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:54,750
easily cast away they're associated with

61
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:57,240
the rise of self-consciousness right and

62
00:02:54,750 --> 00:03:00,210
in the story of the Garden of Eden and I

63
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:02,340
think that's right because I do think

64
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:04,950
that our self-consciousness produces

65
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:07,230
that division within us because more

66
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:10,110
than any other creature were intensely

67
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:12,540
aware of our finitude and suffering and

68
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:15,600
that tends to turn us at least to some

69
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:19,320
degree against being itself you know I

70
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:23,690
was watching a bunch of protesters in

71
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:27,810
the US last week scream out the sky

72
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:29,370
about Trump you know and it was

73
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:32,370
interesting like I thought it was an

74
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:34,530
extraordinarily narcissistic display but

75
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:36,600
but despite that there was something

76
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:39,350
symbolically appropriate about it

77
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:42,480
I also there's a movie I really like

78
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:47,280
sadly enough called fubar I don't know

79
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:49,650
how many of you have seen that yeah you

80
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,800
know that movie I take it yeah it's

81
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:54,989
about the people I grew up with so yeah

82
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:58,019
that's true man I'm telling you that's

83
00:03:54,989 --> 00:04:01,010
true so the the guy the main actor in

84
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:04,230
fubar who's quite bright but completely

85
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:06,090
uncivilized gets testicular cancer and

86
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:07,890
there's one great scene where he gets

87
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:10,860
far too drunk and he's stumbling around

88
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:12,750
the street you know in in a virtually

89
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:14,370
comatose state and of course he's not

90
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:16,470
very thrilled with what's happened to

91
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:18,390
him and he's shaking his fist at the sky

92
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:21,299
it's pouring rain and he's cursing God

93
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:24,000
and you know it's like well you can kind

94
00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:25,650
of understand his position so that kind

95
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,360
of reminded me of these people who were

96
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:29,580
yelling at this guy you know they were

97
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:31,919
basically they were out dramatizing the

98
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:34,620
idea of in rape they were enraged at

99
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:36,479
well you could say god of course most of

100
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:38,820
them wouldn't say that but but they were

101
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:41,640
the ones yelling at the damn sky I mean

102
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:43,020
you know so you got a he got a look at

103
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,350
what they're doing rather than what they

104
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,870
say

105
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:47,910
and they were outraged that being was

106
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:51,750
constructed such that Trump could have

107
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:54,240
arisen as president and so well so this

108
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:56,340
idea you know that we can be easily

109
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,040
turned against being and work for its

110
00:04:56,340 --> 00:05:01,680
destruction is a really it's a really

111
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:04,080
common common common theme it never goes

112
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,330
away you see it echoed in stories like

113
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:09,360
with the new Marvel series for example

114
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:11,550
you see the enmity between Thor and Loki

115
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,350
that's a good example of the same thing

116
00:05:11,550 --> 00:05:15,810
or between Batman and the Joker there's

117
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:19,620
there's a Superman and Lex Luthor these

118
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:22,710
there's these pairs of hero against

119
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:26,700
villain that's a really dramatic and

120
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:29,820
easily what everyone can understand that

121
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:32,250
dynamic right it's a basic plot and the

122
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:34,920
reason it's a basic plot is because it's

123
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:36,660
true of the battle within our spirits

124
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:38,790
our own individual spirits it's true

125
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:41,640
within families because sibling rivalry

126
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:43,560
can be unbelievably brutal it's true

127
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:45,840
between human beings who are strangers

128
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:48,300
it's true between groups of people like

129
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:51,720
it's true at every level of analysis and

130
00:05:48,300 --> 00:05:54,990
then in some sense it's it's archetypal

131
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:57,210
true at least with regards to deep

132
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:59,640
religious symbolism because you see that

133
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:01,530
echoed in many stories as well so I

134
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:03,480
think the clearest representation is

135
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:05,910
probably Christ and Satan that's the

136
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:08,700
closest to a pure archetype although

137
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:11,910
there's in the old Egyptian stories

138
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:15,180
there's Osiris and Seth or Horus and

139
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:18,450
Seth and Seth is a precursor to Satan

140
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:20,280
etymologically so it's a very very

141
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:22,260
common motif and so that's what happens

142
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:24,420
again in Rebecca's womb is that this

143
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:30,240
thing this idea is played out right away

144
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:33,230
and the two two twins are actually what

145
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:37,320
would you call it there they have a

146
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:39,360
superordinate destiny because one of

147
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:42,960
them is destined to become the father of

148
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:45,390
Israel and of course that's a pinnacle

149
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:48,540
moment in the Old Testament obviously

150
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:51,690
and arguably a pinnacle moment in human

151
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:53,370
history now you know degree to which the

152
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:54,720
stories in the Old Testament actually

153
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:56,940
constitute what we would consider

154
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:59,970
empirical history as a matter of debate

155
00:06:56,940 --> 00:07:03,300
but it doesn't matter in some sense

156
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:06,090
because as I mentioned I think before in

157
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:09,990
this lecture series know there are there

158
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:13,200
are forms of fiction that are met a true

159
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:15,120
which means that they're not necessarily

160
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:17,070
about a specific individual although I

161
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,720
generally think they are based on the

162
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:22,070
life of specific individuals it's the

163
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:25,020
simplest theory but who knows right but

164
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:27,960
they're they're more real than reality

165
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:30,000
itself because they abstract out the

166
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:31,800
most relevant elements of reality and

167
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,510
present them to you and that's why you

168
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:35,520
watch fiction you know you don't you

169
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:37,830
want you want your fiction boiled down

170
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,570
right you want to boil down to the

171
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:41,700
essence that's what makes good fiction

172
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:45,600
and that essence is something that's

173
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:48,600
truer than then plain old truth if it's

174
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:51,990
handled well and so you know if you

175
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:53,790
watch a Shakespeare play half a lifetime

176
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:57,150
of events can go by in a Shakespeare

177
00:07:53,790 --> 00:08:01,170
play and it covers you know a wide range

178
00:07:57,150 --> 00:08:03,420
of scenes and so on and and so it's it's

179
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:05,430
cut and edited and compressed all at

180
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:07,980
once but because of that it blasts you

181
00:08:05,430 --> 00:08:11,210
with with a kind of emotional and

182
00:08:07,980 --> 00:08:14,520
ethical force that just the mere

183
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:15,840
videotaping of someone's daily life it

184
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:20,310
wouldn't even wouldn't even come close

185
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:22,740
to approximating so then this motif of

186
00:08:20,310 --> 00:08:32,099
the hostile brothers that's a that's a

187
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:33,840
deep deep archetypal truth and raychel

188
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:35,669
two nations are in thy womb and two

189
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:37,410
manner of people shall be separated from

190
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:39,390
thy bowels and one people shall be

191
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:41,870
stronger than the other and the elder

192
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:45,440
shall serve the younger and so there's a

193
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:49,770
inversion there right because as we've

194
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:51,450
discussed historically speaking and

195
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:54,810
traditionally speaking it's the elder

196
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:58,800
son that to whom the disproportionate

197
00:08:54,810 --> 00:09:02,120
blessings flow there's some truth in

198
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:05,430
that too even more

199
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:07,440
what would you say more empirically iq

200
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:09,750
tends to decrease as the number of

201
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,690
children in the family increase the

202
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:13,240
younger the old

203
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:14,920
is the smartest generally speaking it

204
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:17,020
isn't clear why that is but it might be

205
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:19,180
that they get more attention and who

206
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:23,710
knows so those of you who are younger

207
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:24,520
can be very unhappy about that fact now

208
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:27,930
Jacob

209
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:33,610
okay so there's another there's another

210
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:39,100
plotline here too because Abraham and

211
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:41,650
and Rebecca are at odds at sorry Isaac

212
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:44,170
and Rebecca are at odds about the

213
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:47,800
children right so there's a there's an

214
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:50,800
eatable twist to it too because well

215
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:53,460
Isaac is allied with Esau who turns out

216
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:55,810
to be the hunter type so he's your basic

217
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:58,150
rough-and-tumble character you know and

218
00:09:55,810 --> 00:10:00,190
he's kind of a wild looking guy he'll

219
00:09:58,150 --> 00:10:02,080
Harry and he likes to be outside he

220
00:10:00,190 --> 00:10:04,000
lives in tents he likes to hunt he's a

221
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:04,450
man's man that's one way of thinking

222
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,970
about it

223
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:08,730
whereas Jacob dwells in tents you know

224
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:10,870
he doesn't go outside much he's more

225
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:12,840
well maybe he's more introverted but

226
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:15,880
he's certainly this sort of kid

227
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:18,340
adolescent say who hangs around home and

228
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:19,870
it there's some intimation that he's his

229
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:22,300
mud well he's clearly his mother's

230
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:24,640
favorite and with all the advantages and

231
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:27,670
I suppose disadvantage does go along

232
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:30,640
with that and Isaac and Rebecca don't

233
00:10:27,670 --> 00:10:33,460
see eye-to-eye about who should have

234
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:39,180
predominance among the sons and Rebecca

235
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:41,650
is quite complicit with Jacob in

236
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:43,960
inverting the social order so the first

237
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:49,000
thing that happens that's crooked is

238
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:50,470
that Esau comes in from hunting and he's

239
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,690
you know maybe he's been out for a

240
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:54,550
number of days and he's ravenous and

241
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:56,800
he's kind of an impulsive guy doesn't

242
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:59,980
really seem to think about the long term

243
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:04,089
very much and Jacob was cooking some

244
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:07,450
lentil stew and Esau I want some of it

245
00:11:04,089 --> 00:11:10,780
and Jacob refuses and and then says that

246
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:16,030
he'll trade his his birthright for it

247
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:19,390
and Esau agrees which is a bad deal

248
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:21,700
right it's a bad deal and so you you

249
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:22,780
could say that Esau actually deserves

250
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:25,380
what's coming to him

251
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:27,940
although

252
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:30,070
at minimum you'd have to think of them

253
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:30,970
both as being equally culpable it's a

254
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:35,370
nasty trick

255
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:41,110
and so that's Jacob's first trick and

256
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:44,500
then the second trick is that it's later

257
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:47,470
and Isaac is old and blind and you know

258
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:50,260
close to death and it's time for him to

259
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:52,029
bestow a blessing on his sons which is a

260
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:57,279
very important event apparently among

261
00:11:52,029 --> 00:11:59,680
these ancient people and Esau again is

262
00:11:57,279 --> 00:12:03,130
out hunting and Rachel dress dress is

263
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:04,839
Jacob up in a hairy it puts a goat skin

264
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:07,420
on his arm so he's kind of hairy like

265
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:10,990
Esau and dresses him and Esau is closed

266
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:14,710
so he smells like he's so and Isaac

267
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:17,790
tells Esau to go out and hunt him up

268
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:20,620
some some venison I think it is and

269
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:23,080
which is a favorite of his and Rebekah

270
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:27,250
has Jacob cook up a couple of goat kids

271
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:30,550
and serve that to Isaac and play the

272
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:32,830
role of Esau and so he does that it's

273
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:35,710
pretty net damn nasty really all things

274
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:37,450
considered you know to play a trick like

275
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:40,570
that both on your brother and on your

276
00:12:37,450 --> 00:12:42,370
blind father and the inclusion with your

277
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:44,170
mother it's not the sort of thing that's

278
00:12:42,370 --> 00:12:47,920
really designed to promote a lot of

279
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:49,630
familial harmony and so especially

280
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,510
because you've already screwed him over

281
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:54,990
in a big way once you know you'd think

282
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:58,150
you'd think that would be sufficient so

283
00:12:54,990 --> 00:13:01,030
anyways he's successful and Esau loses

284
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:02,890
his father's blessing and so that Jacob

285
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:04,240
ends up really in the position of the

286
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:07,060
firstborn and it's quite interesting

287
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,339
because you know God tells Rachel that

288
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:11,820
Jacob is going to be the dominant twin

289
00:13:09,339 --> 00:13:14,200
and you'd think again with God's

290
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:16,750
blessing or at least the prophecy that

291
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:19,000
Jacob would end up being a good guy but

292
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:20,200
he's certainly not presented that way to

293
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,940
begin with which is also quite

294
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:23,830
interesting given that he's the eventual

295
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:26,230
founder of Israel and it's another

296
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:28,240
indication of the realism of these old

297
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:29,860
stories you know and it's it's quite

298
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:33,010
amazing to me it's always been quite

299
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:35,140
amazing to me how unpretty fight these

300
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:37,390
stories have remained you know because

301
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:38,230
you'd think that if you're even the

302
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:39,850
least bit sinned

303
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:41,980
especially if you had the kind of

304
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:44,500
Marxist religion is the opiate of the

305
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:46,540
masses kind of viewpoint which which is

306
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:49,270
a credible viewpoint you know although

307
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:51,190
it's wrong but it's correct well I I

308
00:13:49,270 --> 00:13:53,440
think it's a shallow I think it's a

309
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:54,460
shallow interpretation and not part of

310
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,800
the reason I think it's a shallow

311
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:59,290
interpretation is because the stories

312
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:01,840
would be a lot prettier if that was the

313
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:05,980
case these characters wouldn't have this

314
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:08,140
strange realistic moral ambiguity about

315
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:11,530
them you know if you're gonna feed

316
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:13,720
people a fantasy then it you want it to

317
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:15,910
be like a Harlequin novel or or our

318
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:18,190
greeting card or something like that you

319
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:20,290
don't want it to be a story that's full

320
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:22,360
of betrayal and deceit and murder and

321
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:24,060
mayhem and genocide and all of that if

322
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:26,890
that just doesn't seem all that

323
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:28,630
what would you say calming I guess would

324
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:32,530
be the right right answer

325
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:35,800
so anyways Jacob gets away with this but

326
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:37,870
Esau is not happy and and Jacob is quite

327
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,670
convinced that he might kill him and I

328
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:41,320
think that was a reasonable fear because

329
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:43,480
he saw was a tough guy and he was used

330
00:14:41,320 --> 00:14:45,550
to being outside and he knew how to hunt

331
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:47,040
and he knew how to kill and he actually

332
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:50,020
wasn't very happy about getting

333
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:52,630
seriously screwed over by his you know

334
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:55,960
stay-at-home younger brother twice and

335
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:58,180
so Jacob runs off and goes to visit his

336
00:14:55,960 --> 00:15:00,910
uncle and on the way and this is a very

337
00:14:58,180 --> 00:15:05,200
interesting part of this story he stops

338
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:07,540
and to sleep and he takes a stone for a

339
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:10,870
pillow and then he has this vision it's

340
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:13,750
called a dream but the context makes it

341
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:17,260
look like a vision of a ladder reaching

342
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:20,280
up to heaven and with angels moving up

343
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:22,570
and down the the ladder let's say and

344
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:24,490
there's some representations of that I

345
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:27,430
showed you some of them the last time we

346
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:29,230
met but I'll read it to you first he

347
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:30,820
lighted upon a certain place and Ty read

348
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:32,380
there all night because the Sun was set

349
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:34,330
and he took of the stones of that place

350
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:36,610
and put them for his pillows and lay

351
00:15:34,330 --> 00:15:39,190
down in that place to sleep and he

352
00:15:36,610 --> 00:15:41,020
dreamed and beheld a ladder set up on

353
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:42,940
the earth and the top of it reached to

354
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:44,950
heaven and behold the angels of God

355
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:46,990
ascending and descending on it and

356
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:48,940
behold the Lord stood above it and said

357
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:51,510
I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father

358
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:53,850
and the god of Isaac

359
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:56,130
land whereon thou liest to thee I will

360
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:57,600
give it and to thy seed and thy seed

361
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:59,400
shall be as the dust of the earth and

362
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,780
thou shalt spread abroad to the west and

363
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:02,910
to the east and to the north and the

364
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:05,310
south so that lays out the canonical

365
00:16:02,910 --> 00:16:07,560
directions right so now there's a center

366
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:08,880
with the canonical directions like the

367
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:11,130
thing that you see you know that little

368
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:13,830
symbol you see on maps it's the same

369
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:15,720
thing that symbolically placed upon the

370
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:19,800
earth so a center has been established

371
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:22,740
with radiating well with with what with

372
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:27,240
with directional lines radiating from it

373
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:29,010
so it establishes as a place and in the

374
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:30,900
end I seed shall all the families of the

375
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:32,760
earth be blessed so that's pretty good

376
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:35,040
news for Jacob and it's not self-evident

377
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:37,200
why God is rewarding him for running

378
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:39,600
away after screwing over his brother but

379
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:41,910
that seems to be what happens and so

380
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:45,150
here's a couple of representations

381
00:16:41,910 --> 00:16:46,590
classic representations the one on the

382
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:49,770
right is William Blake is what I

383
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:53,820
particularly like you know and Blake

384
00:16:49,770 --> 00:16:57,770
assimilates God with the Sun and with

385
00:16:53,820 --> 00:17:00,270
light right so that's quite a common

386
00:16:57,770 --> 00:17:08,370
mythological idea that that God is

387
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:09,690
associated with light and the day behold

388
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:11,520
I am with thee and will keep thee in all

389
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:13,380
places whither thou goest and will bring

390
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:15,570
me again into this land for I will not

391
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:17,430
leave thee until I have done that which

392
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:18,750
I have spoken to thee of and Jacob

393
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:21,209
awaked out of his sleep and he said

394
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:23,520
surely the Lord is in this place and I

395
00:17:21,209 --> 00:17:26,430
knew it not and he was afraid which is

396
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:28,860
exactly the right response and said how

397
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:30,450
dreadful is this place it is none other

398
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:33,060
than the house of God and this is the

399
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:34,440
gate of heaven and Jacob rose up early

400
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:36,300
in the morning and took the stone that

401
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,580
he had put for his pillows and set it up

402
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:40,440
for a pillar and poured oil on the top

403
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:42,660
of it and that's that's a more important

404
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:45,210
thing than you think and we'll go into

405
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:46,950
that a little bit more deeply because up

406
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:47,910
to this point in this story there isn't

407
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:50,070
anything really

408
00:17:47,910 --> 00:17:52,440
there isn't anything that's really

409
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:54,120
emerged to mark a sacred space right

410
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:56,220
there's no there's no cathedral there's

411
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:58,410
no Church there's nothing like that but

412
00:17:56,220 --> 00:18:01,110
here's this idea that emerges that you

413
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:02,520
can mark the center of something that

414
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:03,960
and that's important and you mark it

415
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,730
with a stone

416
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,260
and stones a good way to mark things

417
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:09,330
that that are important because the

418
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:11,010
stone is permanent right and we mark

419
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:13,140
things with stones now like we mark

420
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:15,480
graves with stones for example because

421
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:17,280
we want to make a memory and to carve

422
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:18,600
something into stone to carve a stone

423
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,180
and then to carve something into stone

424
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:22,920
is to make a memory and to use stone is

425
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:25,290
to make a memory because stone is

426
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:29,040
permanent and to set it up right is to

427
00:18:25,290 --> 00:18:30,990
to indicate a center and so that's what

428
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:33,150
happens and pours oil on the top of it

429
00:18:30,990 --> 00:18:35,100
which is kind of offering and he called

430
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:36,660
the name of that place Bethel but the

431
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:39,990
name of the city was called Las at the

432
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:41,760
first and Jacob vowed a vow saying if

433
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:43,230
God will be with me and will keep me in

434
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:51,930
this way that I go and will give me

435
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:54,990
bread to eat and raiment to put on then

436
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:58,650
a tenth of what I earned I will give him

437
00:18:54,990 --> 00:19:00,420
I missed that that's interesting too

438
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:03,320
because now there's a transformation of

439
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:05,190
sacrifice right because until that point

440
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:07,230
sacrifices have had been pretty

441
00:19:05,190 --> 00:19:07,830
concretize dit was the burning of

442
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:09,960
something

443
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:15,060
whereas here all of a sudden it's the

444
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:17,490
offering of of productive labor per se

445
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:18,840
like a tithe because it tithe is a form

446
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:20,880
of sacrifice and so there's an

447
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:23,250
abstraction of the idea of sacrifice no

448
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:26,610
sacrifice it's really important that the

449
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:28,770
idea of sacrifice gets abstracted right

450
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:31,350
because it should be abstracted to the

451
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:33,090
point where it's it's used the way that

452
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:34,800
we use it today which is you know we

453
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:37,110
make sacrifices to get ahead and

454
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:40,350
everyone understands what that means but

455
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:43,290
the sacrifices are generally some

456
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:45,930
combination of psychological and and and

457
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:48,870
practical so we're not acting them out

458
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:50,550
we're precisely we're not dramatizing

459
00:19:48,870 --> 00:19:52,830
them at ritualizing and we actually act

460
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:55,590
them out in our in the covenant that we

461
00:19:52,830 --> 00:19:57,330
make with the future and we do that well

462
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:59,610
unless we're extraordinarily impulsive

463
00:19:57,330 --> 00:20:01,620
and aimless in our lives and have really

464
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:04,050
no conception whatsoever of the future

465
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:05,730
and are likely to sacrifice the future

466
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:10,050
for the present which is it what he saw

467
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:12,630
does right then we make sacrifices and

468
00:20:10,050 --> 00:20:15,510
you got to think like the idea of making

469
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:17,280
sacrifices to make the future better is

470
00:20:15,510 --> 00:20:17,770
an extraordinarily difficult lesson to

471
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,990
learn

472
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:23,560
it took people god only knows how long

473
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:26,110
to learn that you know like we have no

474
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:29,020
idea it's not something that animals do

475
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:31,270
easily chimpanzees don't store leftover

476
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:32,740
meat you know they just and neither do

477
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:35,500
wolves they just a wolf can eat about

478
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:37,240
thirty pounds of meat in one sitting and

479
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:39,190
that's that's where the idea of wolfing

480
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:40,930
it down comes from they're not hiding it

481
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:44,110
saving it for later you know they can't

482
00:20:40,930 --> 00:20:46,690
do that so they can't sacrifice the

483
00:20:44,110 --> 00:20:49,660
present for the future so this is a big

484
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:51,160
deal that this that this happens now I

485
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:53,950
want to tell you a little bit about the

486
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:58,690
idea of the pillar because it's it's an

487
00:20:53,950 --> 00:21:01,120
unbelievably deep idea and it Orient's

488
00:20:58,690 --> 00:21:03,250
us in ways that we still don't it's

489
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:06,160
still orienting us in ways that we don't

490
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:09,400
understand and in fact it's actually the

491
00:21:06,160 --> 00:21:11,440
mechanism by which we're oriented or and

492
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:13,780
if it's lacking then we become

493
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:16,000
disoriented and so I'll show you some

494
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:19,420
pictures and describe them first okay so

495
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:21,610
first of all there's a walled city so

496
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:23,290
let me tell you that you could think

497
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:25,570
about that as an archetypal human

498
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:28,330
habitation maybe it's a reflection of

499
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:31,390
something like a fire in the middle of

500
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:32,680
the plain or the forest or the jungle

501
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:35,470
for that matter although it's kind of

502
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:38,080
hard to get a fire going there imagine a

503
00:21:35,470 --> 00:21:40,270
fire ringed around with logs and perhaps

504
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:42,430
ringed around with dwellings right so

505
00:21:40,270 --> 00:21:44,710
the fire is in the center and the fire

506
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:46,330
defines the center and then as you move

507
00:21:44,710 --> 00:21:49,260
away from the fire you move out into the

508
00:21:46,330 --> 00:21:52,420
darkness right so the fire is light and

509
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:54,040
communion and safety and as you move

510
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:56,470
away from the fire you move out into the

511
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:58,390
darkness and what's terrifying out

512
00:21:56,470 --> 00:22:00,190
beyond the perimeter so what's beyond

513
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:01,810
the perimeter is terrifying you can feel

514
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:03,580
that if you go camping somewhere that's

515
00:22:01,810 --> 00:22:04,930
wild you know you're pretty damn happy

516
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:07,900
especially if the wolves are howling

517
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:09,820
you're pretty damn happy to be sitting

518
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:13,000
by the fire because you can see there

519
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:15,640
the fire keeps the animals away and you

520
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:17,410
know if you do wander into the bush into

521
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:19,570
the darkness then you're on alert and

522
00:22:17,410 --> 00:22:22,090
you know you're predator detection

523
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:23,970
systems are on alert and so you could

524
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:27,610
think about the classical human

525
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:30,659
habitation as two places one where your

526
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:32,249
predator detection system isn't on alert

527
00:22:30,659 --> 00:22:34,559
another where your predator textured

528
00:22:32,249 --> 00:22:36,869
detection system is alert on alert and

529
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:38,489
you could think about that roughly as

530
00:22:36,869 --> 00:22:41,309
the distinction between explored

531
00:22:38,489 --> 00:22:44,549
territory and unexplored territory and

532
00:22:41,309 --> 00:22:46,739
really the the founding of a place is

533
00:22:44,549 --> 00:22:48,840
precisely this is a lot of this I got

534
00:22:46,739 --> 00:22:50,669
from reading your chair le ah de the

535
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:54,869
founding of a place is precisely the

536
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:57,989
definition of a explored center set

537
00:22:54,869 --> 00:22:59,549
against the unexplored periphery and you

538
00:22:57,989 --> 00:23:01,019
know what's interesting about that so

539
00:22:59,549 --> 00:23:02,460
you can kind of think about that with

540
00:23:01,019 --> 00:23:05,749
regards to the walled city right

541
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:09,529
everything in the wall is cosmos and

542
00:23:05,749 --> 00:23:12,169
everything outside the wall is chaos and

543
00:23:09,529 --> 00:23:15,090
you know but it also extends to the

544
00:23:12,169 --> 00:23:17,070
conceptual realm because imagine that

545
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:19,619
you're the master of a field of study

546
00:23:17,070 --> 00:23:21,809
and so that's an interesting metaphor

547
00:23:19,619 --> 00:23:25,200
because a field is a geographical

548
00:23:21,809 --> 00:23:26,820
metaphor right and if in the center of

549
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:29,009
the field are those things that everyone

550
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:32,849
knows really well the axioms that

551
00:23:29,009 --> 00:23:34,739
everyone abides by in the field and then

552
00:23:32,849 --> 00:23:37,349
as you move towards the fringes you get

553
00:23:34,739 --> 00:23:40,619
to work towards the unknown towards the

554
00:23:37,349 --> 00:23:42,269
frontier of the discipline and as you

555
00:23:40,619 --> 00:23:44,460
become expert you move from the center

556
00:23:42,269 --> 00:23:47,070
to the frontier and so then you're on

557
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:49,080
the border when you're when you're when

558
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:50,460
you're a scholar a competent school

559
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:53,249
you're on the border between the

560
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:55,109
unexplored or the explored and

561
00:23:53,249 --> 00:23:56,820
unexplored and you're trying to further

562
00:23:55,109 --> 00:23:59,759
that border so even if you're just doing

563
00:23:56,820 --> 00:24:02,489
this abstractly it's the same thing and

564
00:23:59,759 --> 00:24:06,059
it's a reflection of the fact that every

565
00:24:02,489 --> 00:24:08,359
human environment concrete or abstract

566
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:12,989
it makes no difference

567
00:24:08,359 --> 00:24:15,899
recapitulates the cosmos chaos dichotomy

568
00:24:12,989 --> 00:24:18,389
or the order chaos dichotomy and that's

569
00:24:15,899 --> 00:24:19,950
why in Taoism for example it's the union

570
00:24:18,389 --> 00:24:22,739
of chaos and order that constitutes

571
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:25,289
being itself and that you stand on the

572
00:24:22,739 --> 00:24:27,570
border between chaos and order because

573
00:24:25,289 --> 00:24:30,570
that's the proper place to be to orderly

574
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:32,729
to much in the explored you're not

575
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:34,710
learning anything too much out there

576
00:24:32,729 --> 00:24:37,109
where the Predators lurk then you're

577
00:24:34,710 --> 00:24:41,639
frozen with terror and neither of those

578
00:24:37,109 --> 00:24:43,710
positions are desirable so and that's

579
00:24:41,639 --> 00:24:44,370
what you know and so you think and this

580
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:46,320
is a concur

581
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:48,450
reality obviously as well as a

582
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:52,020
psychological reality there were reasons

583
00:24:48,450 --> 00:24:54,390
for those walls right because inside the

584
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:56,520
walls where all the people like us and

585
00:24:54,390 --> 00:24:59,280
so that begs the question what does it

586
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:01,050
mean for people to be like us and then

587
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:04,350
outside the wall there rose all those

588
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:06,150
people because they were the worst forms

589
00:25:04,350 --> 00:25:09,090
of predators because people are actually

590
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:12,000
the worst forms of predators who aren't

591
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:14,850
like us and the wall is there to draw a

592
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:17,520
distinction between like us and not like

593
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:19,860
us and so and that was a matter of life

594
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:22,050
and death if you can tell that because I

595
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:24,270
mean look at those walls they had to

596
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:26,670
build those by hand and you know you do

597
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:29,880
see walled cities that have three rings

598
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:32,400
of walls so these people were terrified

599
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:34,230
but not so terrified as the people who

600
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:37,910
built three walls they were really

601
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:45,830
terrified and they had their reasons so

602
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:48,990
okay so now there's an idea that's

603
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:53,670
that's reflected in the Jacob's Ladder

604
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:55,620
story that the center where you put the

605
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:59,220
pillar is also the place where heaven

606
00:25:55,620 --> 00:26:01,410
and earth touch and so that's that's a

607
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:03,990
complicated idea I think that you can

608
00:26:01,410 --> 00:26:05,370
you know I'm trying to look at these

609
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:08,220
stories from a psychological perspective

610
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:10,080
and so then you could say that that's a

611
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:13,380
symbolic place where the lowest and the

612
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:17,490
highest come together and so it's a

613
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:19,130
place where earthly being stretches up

614
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:21,540
to the highest possible ethical

615
00:26:19,130 --> 00:26:24,120
abstraction and that's the center

616
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:27,840
because one of the things that defines

617
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:32,220
us say as opposed to them is that we're

618
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:35,010
all united within a certain ethic that's

619
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:39,320
what makes us the same this is a

620
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:39,320
complicated line of reasoning and but

621
00:26:39,650 --> 00:26:43,890
I'll go back to it after I show you some

622
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:46,020
more pictures but so that's that's the

623
00:26:43,890 --> 00:26:48,240
first idea is that the center is the

624
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:51,059
place where the lowest and the highest

625
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:53,340
touch simultaneously and so you could

626
00:26:51,059 --> 00:26:55,440
say that in some sense it specifies the

627
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:57,540
aim of a group of people that's another

628
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,169
way you know if you get together with

629
00:26:57,540 --> 00:27:00,659
people

630
00:26:58,169 --> 00:27:02,539
make a group even at work you group

631
00:27:00,659 --> 00:27:04,919
yourself around a project and that

632
00:27:02,539 --> 00:27:06,059
unites you and it unites you because you

633
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:08,429
all have the same aim you're all

634
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:10,259
pointing to the same thing and that

635
00:27:08,429 --> 00:27:12,899
makes you the same in some ways because

636
00:27:10,259 --> 00:27:13,950
if you're after the same thing I am then

637
00:27:12,899 --> 00:27:15,389
the same things are going to be

638
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:17,039
important to you that are important to

639
00:27:15,389 --> 00:27:18,600
me and the same things are going to be

640
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:20,190
negative to you that are negative to me

641
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:22,169
because our emotions work out that way

642
00:27:20,190 --> 00:27:24,210
and that means I can instantly predict

643
00:27:22,169 --> 00:27:26,519
you I know how you're going to behave

644
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:28,350
and so our aim which is basically our

645
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:30,929
ethical aim it's because we're aiming at

646
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:33,179
something better at least in principle

647
00:27:30,929 --> 00:27:35,249
we're aiming at something better so our

648
00:27:33,179 --> 00:27:37,169
ethical aim that unites our perceptions

649
00:27:35,249 --> 00:27:39,239
and that's what aligns our emotions and

650
00:27:37,169 --> 00:27:40,789
so that sort of begs the question if

651
00:27:39,239 --> 00:27:44,269
you're going to build a community around

652
00:27:40,789 --> 00:27:47,730
what aim should the community congregate

653
00:27:44,269 --> 00:27:49,049
okay so the idea here is that the center

654
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:50,789
of the community is the pillar that

655
00:27:49,049 --> 00:27:52,679
unites heaven and earth so it unites the

656
00:27:50,789 --> 00:27:54,840
lowest with the highest so there's some

657
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:58,649
intimation of the idea that it's the

658
00:27:54,840 --> 00:28:02,009
highest that unites the community okay

659
00:27:58,649 --> 00:28:04,409
and so keep that in mind and that's a

660
00:28:02,009 --> 00:28:06,690
very old idea as well that's the idea of

661
00:28:04,409 --> 00:28:08,489
the axis mundi which is the center pole

662
00:28:06,690 --> 00:28:11,129
that unites heaven and earth it's an

663
00:28:08,489 --> 00:28:13,109
unbelievably old idea tens of thousands

664
00:28:11,129 --> 00:28:17,159
of years old it might even stretch back

665
00:28:13,109 --> 00:28:17,909
to whatever our archaic memories quasi

666
00:28:17,159 --> 00:28:19,739
memories

667
00:28:17,909 --> 00:28:22,639
I don't know how what you would describe

668
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:25,440
them archetypal memories of our

669
00:28:22,639 --> 00:28:28,019
excessively old ancestry and trees when

670
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:30,539
the tree itself was in fact the center

671
00:28:28,019 --> 00:28:34,320
of the world and that it was ringed by

672
00:28:30,539 --> 00:28:36,119
snakes and chaos and so well we have no

673
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:38,549
idea how old these ideas are but they're

674
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:41,220
very very old and evolution is a

675
00:28:38,549 --> 00:28:44,940
conservative business once it builds a

676
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:46,679
gadget then it builds new things on top

677
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:48,389
of that gadgets like a medieval town

678
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:52,559
right the center of the town is really

679
00:28:48,389 --> 00:28:54,210
old and new newer areas of the town get

680
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:56,129
built around it but the center is still

681
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:59,879
really old and that's what we're like

682
00:28:56,129 --> 00:29:03,259
you know our platforms like our our

683
00:28:59,879 --> 00:29:06,929
basic physiological structure this this

684
00:29:03,259 --> 00:29:09,059
skeletal body is some tens of millions

685
00:29:06,929 --> 00:29:10,649
of years old or older than that if you

686
00:29:09,059 --> 00:29:11,450
think about vertebrates it's much older

687
00:29:10,649 --> 00:29:15,740
than that

688
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:17,870
and that's all conserved so everything's

689
00:29:15,740 --> 00:29:19,669
built on top of everything else alright

690
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:23,299
so there there's a kind of a classic

691
00:29:19,669 --> 00:29:25,370
town and there's the idea I showed you

692
00:29:23,299 --> 00:29:26,960
this is Scandinavian World Tree same

693
00:29:25,370 --> 00:29:29,299
idea at unites heaven and earth and

694
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:31,700
around the roots of that tree are snakes

695
00:29:29,299 --> 00:29:34,490
that eat this tree constantly so that's

696
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:36,769
the idea that there's stability but

697
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:39,769
there's constant transformation around

698
00:29:36,769 --> 00:29:41,080
that stability and at the same time the

699
00:29:39,769 --> 00:29:44,029
snakes are knowing in the roots there's

700
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:46,519
streams that are nourishing it so it's

701
00:29:44,029 --> 00:29:48,559
sort of it's sort of an echo of the idea

702
00:29:46,519 --> 00:29:51,139
that life depends on death and renewal

703
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:53,600
constantly because your cells are dying

704
00:29:51,139 --> 00:29:55,789
and being renewed constantly right if

705
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:57,860
they are just proliferating then you

706
00:29:55,789 --> 00:30:00,080
have cancer if they're just dying then

707
00:29:57,860 --> 00:30:02,299
you die it you have to get the balance

708
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:04,250
between death and life exactly right so

709
00:30:02,299 --> 00:30:07,730
that you can actually live which is also

710
00:30:04,250 --> 00:30:10,100
a very strange thing so and that tree is

711
00:30:07,730 --> 00:30:12,200
something that reaches from the bottom

712
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:14,480
layers of being maybe the microcosm all

713
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:18,080
the way to the macrocosm that's the idea

714
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:22,610
anyways so then there's okay so there's

715
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:24,529
there's Jacob and his and his pillar

716
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:26,659
he's got this idea that you can mark the

717
00:30:24,529 --> 00:30:28,309
center with this stone like it sort of

718
00:30:26,659 --> 00:30:29,750
symbolizes what he was laying on when he

719
00:30:28,309 --> 00:30:32,210
dreamt but now he's got this idea you

720
00:30:29,750 --> 00:30:35,360
put something erect and it marks the

721
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:37,580
center and it symbolizes his vision of

722
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:40,010
the highest good something like that and

723
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:43,130
the promise that's been made to him and

724
00:30:40,010 --> 00:30:46,789
then this is an Egyptian obelisk the

725
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:48,860
pyramid on top of it that's in Paris it

726
00:30:46,789 --> 00:30:54,279
was taken from Luxor and it put in Paris

727
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:54,279
and so that's a much more sophisticated

728
00:30:54,970 --> 00:31:00,710
instance of the same idea okay and there

729
00:30:58,490 --> 00:31:02,929
was a Stone Age cultures across Eurasia

730
00:31:00,710 --> 00:31:04,610
that put up these huge obelisks

731
00:31:02,929 --> 00:31:06,169
everywhere these huge like the

732
00:31:04,610 --> 00:31:07,639
Stonehenge is a good example of that

733
00:31:06,169 --> 00:31:10,970
although it's it's very sophisticated

734
00:31:07,639 --> 00:31:12,289
and there are also markers of places we

735
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:14,539
don't know exactly what their function

736
00:31:12,289 --> 00:31:19,340
is but they're very much akin to this

737
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:21,980
some permanent marker of place there's a

738
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:23,870
good one so that's in st. Peters and I

739
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:24,830
really like this one because you can see

740
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:29,570
the

741
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:31,280
echoes of jacob's vision for the

742
00:31:29,570 --> 00:31:33,020
establishment of a territory there right

743
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:35,630
you've got the obelisk in the middle and

744
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:38,330
then you've got the directions radiating

745
00:31:35,630 --> 00:31:40,160
from the center and of course save

746
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:42,560
Peters this is the st. Peter's Basilica

747
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:44,650
in Rome which is an absolutely

748
00:31:42,560 --> 00:31:48,050
unbelievable place it's just

749
00:31:44,650 --> 00:31:49,610
jaw-dropping and so there's the

750
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:51,500
Cathedral at the back of it and then

751
00:31:49,610 --> 00:31:53,540
there's this circle of pillars that

752
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:56,720
surrounds it you can just see them a

753
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:58,640
little bit on on the middle left there

754
00:31:56,720 --> 00:32:02,210
that goes all the way around that entire

755
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:05,270
enclosure and you know very large number

756
00:32:02,210 --> 00:32:07,340
of people can gather there and then so

757
00:32:05,270 --> 00:32:08,990
that pillar marks the center and that

758
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:10,100
would be the center of Catholicism

759
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:12,680
essentially that's what that represents

760
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:15,050
right the the symbolic center of

761
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:16,640
Catholicism although you could make the

762
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:18,050
case that the cathedral is the center it

763
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:20,720
doesn't really matter they're very close

764
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:23,570
together and it's it's half a dozen of

765
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:26,030
one and six or the other and then here's

766
00:32:23,570 --> 00:32:28,010
another representation of the same idea

767
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:29,630
right is that this is why people don't

768
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:31,790
like the flag to be burned

769
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:34,550
you know because conservative people see

770
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:37,490
the flag as the sacred thing that binds

771
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:40,400
people together and so they're not happy

772
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:42,170
when that sacred thing is destroyed even

773
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,850
if it's destroyed in the name of protest

774
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:46,340
whereas the people who burn flags think

775
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:48,440
well there are times to dramatize the

776
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:51,560
idea that the center has been corrupt

777
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:53,210
and you can demonstrate that by putting

778
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:56,390
it to the torch you know as a

779
00:32:53,210 --> 00:33:00,200
representation that that this that the

780
00:32:56,390 --> 00:33:02,690
corrupt center now has to be burned and

781
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:04,550
transformed and the thing is they're

782
00:33:02,690 --> 00:33:06,740
both right they're both right all the

783
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:08,870
time because the center is absolutely

784
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:11,770
necessary and is sacred and is almost

785
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:14,210
always also corrupt and in need of

786
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:16,550
reparation that's also an archetypal

787
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:18,650
idea and and that's a useful thing to

788
00:33:16,550 --> 00:33:20,650
know because you know it it's easy for

789
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:22,790
young people in particular to think that

790
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:25,370
well the world's going to hell in a

791
00:33:22,790 --> 00:33:27,020
handbasket and it's the pot fault of the

792
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:29,240
last generation they've left us this

793
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:30,740
terrible mess and you know we've feeling

794
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:32,450
pretty betrayed about that and now we

795
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:33,860
have to clean it up it's like yeah yeah

796
00:33:32,450 --> 00:33:37,470
people have been thinking that for like

797
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:38,730
thirty five thousand years it's not new

798
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:40,620
and the reason it's not new is because

799
00:33:38,730 --> 00:33:43,860
it's always true you know what you're

800
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:46,740
handed is a sacred center with flaws

801
00:33:43,860 --> 00:33:49,139
always always that's partly because it's

802
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:50,850
the creation of the dead right and the

803
00:33:49,139 --> 00:33:52,379
dead can't see and they can't

804
00:33:50,850 --> 00:33:54,539
communicate and so they're not in touch

805
00:33:52,379 --> 00:33:56,879
with the present and so what they've

806
00:33:54,539 --> 00:33:58,590
bequeathed to you apart from the fact

807
00:33:56,879 --> 00:34:00,299
that it might actually be corrupt which

808
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:03,000
is a slightly different thing is at

809
00:34:00,299 --> 00:34:04,440
least blind in dead and so what the hell

810
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,539
can you expect from something that's

811
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:07,919
blind and dead you know you're lucky if

812
00:34:06,539 --> 00:34:10,919
it just doesn't stomp you out of

813
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:12,929
existence so so that's a lovely

814
00:34:10,919 --> 00:34:16,889
photograph obviously and that's the

815
00:34:12,929 --> 00:34:18,990
establishment of a new centre then the

816
00:34:16,889 --> 00:34:22,909
the centre can be a cathedral too and

817
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:25,669
often is of course in in classic towns

818
00:34:22,909 --> 00:34:27,929
European towns in particular although

819
00:34:25,669 --> 00:34:30,030
it's not only European towns that are

820
00:34:27,929 --> 00:34:31,800
like this there there's a center that's

821
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:33,810
made out of stone so that would be the

822
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:35,849
Cathedral and it's got the highest tower

823
00:34:33,810 --> 00:34:38,700
on on top of the tower there's often a

824
00:34:35,849 --> 00:34:41,250
cross and that's the symbolic centre so

825
00:34:38,700 --> 00:34:43,859
people are are drawn together around

826
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:46,079
whatever the cross represents now that

827
00:34:43,859 --> 00:34:48,450
the cross obviously represents a center

828
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:51,089
because it's an X right x marks the spot

829
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:53,220
so the centre of the cross is the center

830
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:55,710
and then the Cathedral is often in a

831
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:58,260
cross shape which also marks the center

832
00:34:55,710 --> 00:35:01,520
and then in the cathedral there's a dome

833
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:04,050
often and that's the sky and that's that

834
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:06,359
ladder that reaches from earth to heaven

835
00:35:04,050 --> 00:35:11,150
so it's a recapitulation of the same

836
00:35:06,359 --> 00:35:13,829
idea so and people are drawn to that

837
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:15,660
Center and the centre is the symbol of

838
00:35:13,829 --> 00:35:19,530
what unites them and what unites them is

839
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:22,200
the faith that the cathedral is the

840
00:35:19,530 --> 00:35:23,940
embodiment of and you think well what

841
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:25,560
does the faith mean and again we're

842
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:28,500
approaching this psychologically and

843
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:30,569
what it means is that we everyone who's

844
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:33,510
a member of that group accepts the

845
00:35:30,569 --> 00:35:35,010
transcendent ideal of the group now the

846
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:36,990
thing is if you're the member of a group

847
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:39,180
you accept the transcendent ideal of the

848
00:35:36,990 --> 00:35:41,190
group that's what it means to be a

849
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:42,930
member of a group so if you're in a work

850
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:45,119
team and you're all working on a project

851
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:47,930
what you've essentially done is decided

852
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:49,859
that you're going to make the goal

853
00:35:47,930 --> 00:35:51,330
unquestionable right I mean you might

854
00:35:49,859 --> 00:35:52,980
argue about the details but if

855
00:35:51,330 --> 00:35:55,200
are tasked with something you know

856
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:57,480
here's a job for you ten people organize

857
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:59,520
yourself around the job you can argue

858
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:01,860
about how you're going to do the job but

859
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:04,650
you can't argue about the job then the

860
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:08,280
group falls apart and so there's an act

861
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:10,260
of faith in some sense the reason that

862
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:12,090
the act of faith is necessary is because

863
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:14,490
it's very very difficult to specify

864
00:36:12,090 --> 00:36:16,650
without error what that central aim

865
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:18,720
should be given that there's any number

866
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:20,280
of aims right and it's a very very

867
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,450
difficult thing to figure out and this

868
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:24,450
is something we're gonna do a little bit

869
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:26,960
tonight is like what should the aim be

870
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:29,790
around which a group would congregate

871
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:32,070
you know that so so especially if it's a

872
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:33,930
large group and it's a large group that

873
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:36,650
has to stay together across very large

874
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:39,060
swathes of time and the group is

875
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:41,460
incredibly diverse you know what

876
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:44,130
possible kind of ideal could unite a

877
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:46,260
large group of diverse people across a

878
00:36:44,130 --> 00:36:48,180
very large stretch of time that's a

879
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:50,340
really really hard question and I think

880
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:51,930
part of the way that question has been

881
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:54,180
answered is it's been answered

882
00:36:51,930 --> 00:36:55,890
symbolically and in images because it's

883
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:59,700
so damn complicated that it's almost

884
00:36:55,890 --> 00:37:01,620
impossible to articulate so but

885
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:03,450
obviously you need to have a center

886
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:05,730
around which everyone can unite because

887
00:37:03,450 --> 00:37:07,110
if you don't then everyone's at odds

888
00:37:05,730 --> 00:37:08,430
with one another like if I don't know

889
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:09,270
what you're up to and you don't know

890
00:37:08,430 --> 00:37:11,700
what he's up to

891
00:37:09,270 --> 00:37:13,770
we have no we're just strangers and we

892
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:16,080
don't know that our ethics match at all

893
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:18,780
then the probability that we're going to

894
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:21,630
be able to exist harmoniously decreases

895
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:23,550
rapidly to zero and that's obviously

896
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:26,190
just no good that's a state of total

897
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:30,510
chaos so we can't have that it's it's

898
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:33,270
not possible to exist without a central

899
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:35,010
ideal it's not possible and it's deeper

900
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:39,900
than that it's deeper than that partly

901
00:37:35,010 --> 00:37:41,430
because it's I don't know I'll try to

902
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:44,570
get this right this is the sort of thing

903
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:48,030
that I was arguing with sam harris about

904
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:51,480
you see your category system is a

905
00:37:48,030 --> 00:37:53,850
product of your aims that's the thing

906
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:55,800
like if you have a set of facts at hand

907
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:57,870
the facts don't tell you how to

908
00:37:55,800 --> 00:38:01,350
categorize the facts because there's too

909
00:37:57,870 --> 00:38:04,740
damn many facts there's a trillion facts

910
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:05,100
and there's no way without imposing some

911
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:07,290
ape

912
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:08,760
I already order on them of determining

913
00:38:07,290 --> 00:38:10,440
how it is that you should order them so

914
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:14,490
how do you order them well that's easy

915
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:16,350
you decide what you're aiming at now how

916
00:38:14,490 --> 00:38:18,060
do you do that well I'm not answering

917
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:20,280
that question at the moment I'm just

918
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:23,040
saying that in order to organize those

919
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:25,290
facts you need a name and then the aim

920
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:27,720
instantly organizes the facts into those

921
00:38:25,290 --> 00:38:29,880
things relevant to the aim tools let's

922
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:32,190
say those things that get in the way and

923
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:33,810
a very large number of things that you

924
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:37,050
don't have to pay attention to at all

925
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:38,970
right it excludes Verte like if you're

926
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:43,890
working on an engineering problem you

927
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:46,470
don't have to worry about practicing

928
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:48,000
medicine in your neighborhood you don't

929
00:38:46,470 --> 00:38:53,250
there's a bunch of like if you're

930
00:38:48,000 --> 00:39:00,420
focusing on a particular what would you

931
00:38:53,250 --> 00:39:02,580
say any any job any any set of skills

932
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:03,990
implies that you're good at a small set

933
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:06,420
of things and then not good at an

934
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:09,600
incredibly large number of other skills

935
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:12,090
it simplifies things and so you can use

936
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:14,910
your aim as the basis of a category

937
00:39:12,090 --> 00:39:16,830
structure and so you also have to keep

938
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:18,900
that in mind because what it means is as

939
00:39:16,830 --> 00:39:22,440
far as I can tell that what it means is

940
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:24,360
that your category system itself which

941
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:26,310
is what structures your perceptions is

942
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:29,220
actually dependent on the ethics of your

943
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:31,890
aim it's directly it's a moral thing

944
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:35,010
it's directly dependent on your aim and

945
00:39:31,890 --> 00:39:36,930
that's a stunning idea if it happens to

946
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:39,900
be true it's not how people think about

947
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:41,730
thinking we don't think that way we like

948
00:39:39,900 --> 00:39:44,580
we think that we think deterministically

949
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:46,680
let's say or that we think empirically

950
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:48,300
or that we think rationally and none of

951
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:50,790
that appears to be the case what we do

952
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:52,410
is we pause it a valid aim and then we

953
00:39:50,790 --> 00:39:54,540
organize the world around the aim and

954
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:56,700
there's plenty of evidence from that in

955
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:58,830
in in psychological studies of

956
00:39:56,700 --> 00:40:01,770
perception right that that does look

957
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:04,290
like how the the perceptual systems work

958
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:06,420
mostly they ignore because the world is

959
00:40:04,290 --> 00:40:09,750
too complicated they focus on a small

960
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:11,550
set of phenomena deemed relevant to

961
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:13,830
whatever the aim is and then of course

962
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:16,470
the aim is problematic again it's

963
00:40:13,830 --> 00:40:19,020
complex because the aim I have has to be

964
00:40:16,470 --> 00:40:21,450
a name that some of you at

965
00:40:19,020 --> 00:40:22,800
or at least don't object to because

966
00:40:21,450 --> 00:40:25,020
otherwise I'm not gonna get anywhere

967
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:27,180
with my damn aim it has to actually be

968
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:29,400
implementable in the world it has to be

969
00:40:27,180 --> 00:40:32,340
sustainable across at least some amount

970
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:35,280
of time it can't kill me like it's

971
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:37,830
really hedged in this aim it's it isn't

972
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:41,130
any old thing there's hardly any things

973
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:45,720
that it can be so you know Jacob's aim

974
00:40:41,130 --> 00:40:47,970
for example in undermining Esau almost

975
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:49,410
gets him killed and you can understand

976
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:51,570
why that's the other thing you think

977
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:54,090
well that that was a nasty bit of work

978
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:55,920
you can understand Esau's rage it's even

979
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:58,560
though we're separated from the people

980
00:40:55,920 --> 00:41:00,150
in these stories by what four thousand

981
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:03,390
years three thousand years something

982
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:05,430
like that you know in immediately why

983
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:07,320
everyone feels the way they do at least

984
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:09,690
once you understand the context of the

985
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:14,460
story that none of that's mysterious in

986
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:17,790
the least so so there's the church and

987
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:19,830
the church is underneath the cross right

988
00:41:17,790 --> 00:41:22,560
and so that's st. Peter's Basilica and

989
00:41:19,830 --> 00:41:25,170
so there's the cross on the globe on top

990
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:30,960
of the Basilica and then there's the

991
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:33,030
cross on the obelisk as well and so what

992
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:36,350
that means is that and this is where

993
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:39,180
things get insanely complicated is that

994
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:41,160
the center is defined by whatever the

995
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:43,560
cross represents now the cross

996
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:45,270
represents a crossing point

997
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:47,820
geographically it's it's certainly that

998
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:50,160
the cross probably represents the body

999
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:52,430
to some degree but then the cross also

1000
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:55,080
represents the place of suffering

1001
00:41:52,430 --> 00:41:57,150
obviously and more importantly it

1002
00:41:55,080 --> 00:42:00,119
represents the place of voluntary

1003
00:41:57,150 --> 00:42:02,390
suffering transcended I'm speaking

1004
00:42:00,119 --> 00:42:05,220
psychologically right not theologically

1005
00:42:02,390 --> 00:42:07,609
that's what it represents and so you

1006
00:42:05,220 --> 00:42:10,140
might say so here's the idea behind

1007
00:42:07,609 --> 00:42:12,690
putting down the obelisk with the cross

1008
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:14,160
and saying that that's the center so

1009
00:42:12,690 --> 00:42:16,440
that's the thing that everyone's aiming

1010
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:18,270
at and so the the idea would be well if

1011
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:20,520
you're going to be a member of the group

1012
00:42:18,270 --> 00:42:23,970
defined by this obelisk then what you do

1013
00:42:20,520 --> 00:42:26,250
is accept your position at the center of

1014
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:29,550
suffering voluntarily and therefore

1015
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:31,080
transcend it that's the idea and that is

1016
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:32,790
one hell of an idea

1017
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:35,490
it really is man that is

1018
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:37,770
a killer idea because it's actually a

1019
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:39,990
signal it's a really clear signal of

1020
00:42:37,770 --> 00:42:41,220
psychological health you know because

1021
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:43,020
one of the things you do if you're a

1022
00:42:41,220 --> 00:42:45,960
clinical psychologist and someone is

1023
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:48,240
paralyzed by fear is what you do is you

1024
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:50,850
break their fears down into relatively

1025
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:53,940
manageable bits and then you have them

1026
00:42:50,850 --> 00:42:55,260
voluntarily confront their fears and it

1027
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:56,820
might also be things that they're

1028
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:58,380
disgusted by it's a if they have

1029
00:42:56,820 --> 00:43:00,060
obsessive compulsive disorder

1030
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:02,430
but it produces very strong negative

1031
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:04,560
emotion whatever it is and then you have

1032
00:43:02,430 --> 00:43:06,990
them voluntarily confront whatever it is

1033
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:09,150
that produces that overwhelming negative

1034
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:11,910
emotion and that makes them stronger

1035
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:15,150
that's what happens it doesn't make them

1036
00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:16,830
less afraid it makes them more

1037
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:18,600
courageous and stronger and that is not

1038
00:43:16,830 --> 00:43:21,210
the same thing it's seriously not it

1039
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:24,060
doesn't decrease the fear it increases

1040
00:43:21,210 --> 00:43:27,180
the courage and so that's a

1041
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:28,440
mind-boggling idea and it's deeper you

1042
00:43:27,180 --> 00:43:30,330
know one of the things that's really

1043
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:32,280
interesting about these archetypal ideas

1044
00:43:30,330 --> 00:43:34,230
is that and maybe it's partly because of

1045
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:36,060
the hyperlink nature of the Bible that's

1046
00:43:34,230 --> 00:43:38,010
part of it but it's not the whole thing

1047
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:40,110
is that no matter how deep you dig into

1048
00:43:38,010 --> 00:43:42,000
them you'll never get to the bottom you

1049
00:43:40,110 --> 00:43:44,520
know you hit a bottom you think god

1050
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,110
that's so unbelievably profound and then

1051
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:47,760
if you excavate a little underneath that

1052
00:43:46,110 --> 00:43:49,710
you find something else that's even more

1053
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:51,360
profound and you think wow that's got to

1054
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:53,520
be the bottom and then you dig under

1055
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:55,530
that's like there's no bottom you can

1056
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:57,240
just keep digging down well as far as I

1057
00:43:55,530 --> 00:43:59,490
can tell you can keep digging down layer

1058
00:43:57,240 --> 00:44:01,350
after layer and we'll talk a little bit

1059
00:43:59,490 --> 00:44:05,100
about more a little more about what the

1060
00:44:01,350 --> 00:44:06,450
cross signifies as the center because

1061
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:09,450
you see what people were trying to

1062
00:44:06,450 --> 00:44:11,970
figure out is what is it that we need to

1063
00:44:09,450 --> 00:44:13,800
unite under right what's the proper

1064
00:44:11,970 --> 00:44:16,110
thing to unite under I can give you

1065
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:20,880
another example so in the Mesopotamian

1066
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:23,550
societies the Emperor you know who was

1067
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:25,770
more or less an an absolute monarch he

1068
00:44:23,550 --> 00:44:28,950
lived inside what was essentially a

1069
00:44:25,770 --> 00:44:31,560
walled city and the god of the

1070
00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:34,200
Mesopotamians was mardik and Marduk was

1071
00:44:31,560 --> 00:44:35,940
the figure who had eyes all the way

1072
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:37,350
around his head and he spoke magic words

1073
00:44:35,940 --> 00:44:39,570
who is very attentive and very

1074
00:44:37,350 --> 00:44:42,240
articulate and it was Marduk who went

1075
00:44:39,570 --> 00:44:44,430
out and confronted the goddess of chaos

1076
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:46,080
the dragon of chaos and cut her into

1077
00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:47,970
pieces and made up the world

1078
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:50,670
okay so you can kind of understand what

1079
00:44:47,970 --> 00:44:53,910
that means so mardik goes beyond the

1080
00:44:50,670 --> 00:44:56,850
frontier into the place of predatory

1081
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:59,100
chaos and encounters the thing that's

1082
00:44:56,850 --> 00:45:01,290
terrifying and then make something

1083
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:04,020
productive out of it so it's a hero myth

1084
00:45:01,290 --> 00:45:06,150
and an mardik is elected to the position

1085
00:45:04,020 --> 00:45:08,250
of preeminent God by all the other

1086
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:11,190
Mesopotamian gods because he manages

1087
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:15,210
that so the the mardik idea emerges up

1088
00:45:11,190 --> 00:45:17,280
the Holy dominance hierarchy and hits

1089
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:19,140
the pinnacle so that and god only knows

1090
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:21,600
how long that took it would be the

1091
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:26,850
amalgamation of many tribes and then

1092
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:28,980
that the what the the distillation of

1093
00:45:26,850 --> 00:45:31,740
all the tribal myths to produce this

1094
00:45:28,980 --> 00:45:34,050
emergent story of what constitutes Tok

1095
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:36,630
God and then the job of the Emperor was

1096
00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:38,880
to act out Marduk that's what gave him

1097
00:45:36,630 --> 00:45:41,220
sovereignty so the reason that he was

1098
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:43,650
the center around which people organized

1099
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:45,000
themselves wasn't because he was when he

1100
00:45:43,650 --> 00:45:46,110
was being a proper Emperor it wasn't

1101
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:48,540
because there was something super

1102
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:50,970
special about him like the power didn't

1103
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:52,800
exactly reside in him which is a really

1104
00:45:50,970 --> 00:45:54,600
useful thing to separate right you want

1105
00:45:52,800 --> 00:45:57,900
the power which is why it's kind of nice

1106
00:45:54,600 --> 00:46:00,180
to have a symbolic monarch you get the

1107
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:01,590
symbolic power separated from the

1108
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:03,480
personality power right because

1109
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:05,700
otherwise they get conflated that's what

1110
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:07,680
happened in Rome it's a very you know

1111
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:09,300
you can see it tending to happen now and

1112
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:11,960
then in the u.s. like with the Kennedy

1113
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:14,550
dynasty's and that sort of thing so the

1114
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:16,230
idea was the Emperor had sovereignty as

1115
00:46:14,550 --> 00:46:18,840
long as he was acting out Marduk

1116
00:46:16,230 --> 00:46:21,090
properly and going out into the chaos

1117
00:46:18,840 --> 00:46:22,980
and cutting it into pieces and making

1118
00:46:21,090 --> 00:46:25,230
order that was his job so they used to

1119
00:46:22,980 --> 00:46:27,450
take him outside the city on the new

1120
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:30,660
year's festival and strip him of all his

1121
00:46:27,450 --> 00:46:36,030
Emperor garments and humiliate him and

1122
00:46:30,660 --> 00:46:37,890
then force him to to confess all the

1123
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:41,370
ways that year he hadn't been a good

1124
00:46:37,890 --> 00:46:42,720
Marduk so he wasn't a good ruler and so

1125
00:46:41,370 --> 00:46:44,610
that was supposed to clue him in and

1126
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:47,970
wake him up right and then they would

1127
00:46:44,610 --> 00:46:51,270
ritually reenact the Battle of Marduk

1128
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:54,450
against time out the chaos monster using

1129
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:56,280
statues and then if that all went well

1130
00:46:54,450 --> 00:46:58,410
then the Emperor would go back in and

1131
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:59,579
the city would be renewed for another

1132
00:46:58,410 --> 00:47:00,809
year and we still have

1133
00:46:59,579 --> 00:47:02,430
echoes of that in our New Year's

1134
00:47:00,809 --> 00:47:04,589
celebration right it's the same idea

1135
00:47:02,430 --> 00:47:07,469
that's echoed down all those all those

1136
00:47:04,589 --> 00:47:09,930
centuries thousands of years so it says

1137
00:47:07,469 --> 00:47:12,719
such a staggeringly brilliant idea right

1138
00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:14,309
because so part of the idea is that the

1139
00:47:12,719 --> 00:47:16,410
thing that's sovereign so that's the

1140
00:47:14,309 --> 00:47:19,499
pillar at the center that that everyone

1141
00:47:16,410 --> 00:47:21,209
gathers around is at least in part the

1142
00:47:19,499 --> 00:47:23,160
thing that courageously goes out into

1143
00:47:21,209 --> 00:47:28,519
the unknown and make something useful

1144
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:28,519
out out of it for the community so

1145
00:47:28,609 --> 00:47:35,369
that's very very smart it's very smart

1146
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:37,140
so this is another example of a center

1147
00:47:35,369 --> 00:47:39,779
so these this is the flag this is the

1148
00:47:37,140 --> 00:47:41,940
Union Jack and so it's made up of a

1149
00:47:39,779 --> 00:47:44,700
bunch of crosses right and so the first

1150
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:46,499
cross the English cross that's the flag

1151
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:50,369
of st. George that's the flag of England

1152
00:47:46,499 --> 00:47:52,890
and st. what is st. George do slaves the

1153
00:47:50,369 --> 00:47:54,779
dragon exactly same idea right so safe

1154
00:47:52,890 --> 00:47:56,309
George patron saint of England goes out

1155
00:47:54,779 --> 00:47:58,890
and slays the dragon and frees the

1156
00:47:56,309 --> 00:48:01,170
Virgin from the grip of the dragon same

1157
00:47:58,890 --> 00:48:06,089
idea right so that's the center and then

1158
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:08,609
the second cross is called a saltier

1159
00:48:06,089 --> 00:48:10,729
but it's another crucifix so it's the

1160
00:48:08,609 --> 00:48:13,380
cross on which st. Andrew was crucified

1161
00:48:10,729 --> 00:48:15,979
says so it's the same idea it's that the

1162
00:48:13,380 --> 00:48:18,479
center is the center of suffering

1163
00:48:15,979 --> 00:48:20,969
voluntarily undertaken cuz Saint Andrew

1164
00:48:18,479 --> 00:48:23,369
was a martyr and then st. Patrick is the

1165
00:48:20,969 --> 00:48:27,539
third cross what did st. Patrick do in

1166
00:48:23,369 --> 00:48:30,479
Ireland chased out all the snakes right

1167
00:48:27,539 --> 00:48:33,089
so it's the same thing right and so the

1168
00:48:30,479 --> 00:48:34,859
flag of Great Britain is the combination

1169
00:48:33,089 --> 00:48:36,900
of all of these three crosses that

1170
00:48:34,859 --> 00:48:39,619
defines the center and that's what the

1171
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:43,259
flag is so that symbolizes all of that

1172
00:48:39,619 --> 00:48:46,890
so that's you know completely

1173
00:48:43,259 --> 00:48:49,229
mind-boggling so and there's more about

1174
00:48:46,890 --> 00:48:51,869
st. Patrick - so he banishes the snakes

1175
00:48:49,229 --> 00:48:54,390
after a 40-day fast and so that's an

1176
00:48:51,869 --> 00:48:56,549
allusion to the 40 years that Moses

1177
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:58,410
spends in the desert and also the 40

1178
00:48:56,549 --> 00:49:00,900
days that Christ fasts in the New

1179
00:48:58,410 --> 00:49:03,209
Testament and his walking stick when he

1180
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:05,579
plants it grows into a tree so that

1181
00:49:03,209 --> 00:49:07,589
echoes all of this ideas about the

1182
00:49:05,579 --> 00:49:09,709
center that we just described and he

1183
00:49:07,589 --> 00:49:12,299
also speaks with the ancient Irish

1184
00:49:09,709 --> 00:49:13,170
ancestors which if you remember is a

1185
00:49:12,299 --> 00:49:17,160
characteristic

1186
00:49:13,170 --> 00:49:18,990
of the shamanic rituals where we're so

1187
00:49:17,160 --> 00:49:23,579
in the typical shamanic ritual which

1188
00:49:18,990 --> 00:49:27,690
seems to be elicited by psychedelic use

1189
00:49:23,579 --> 00:49:29,400
the shaman dissolved down past their

1190
00:49:27,690 --> 00:49:31,619
bones and then they go up into heaven

1191
00:49:29,400 --> 00:49:33,599
and speak with the ancestors and then

1192
00:49:31,619 --> 00:49:36,839
they're introduced into the heavenly

1193
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:38,670
kingdom and then the flesh is put back

1194
00:49:36,839 --> 00:49:40,530
on their bones and they come back and

1195
00:49:38,670 --> 00:49:43,500
tell everybody what happened and that's

1196
00:49:40,530 --> 00:49:45,930
a repeatable experience right the

1197
00:49:43,500 --> 00:49:49,710
shamanic tradition is unbelievably

1198
00:49:45,930 --> 00:49:52,380
widespread so all over Europe ancient

1199
00:49:49,710 --> 00:49:54,540
Europe and Asia and perhaps as far down

1200
00:49:52,380 --> 00:49:56,520
as South America right it's highly

1201
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:58,950
conserved and it's out of that tradition

1202
00:49:56,520 --> 00:50:01,589
in all likelihood that our religious

1203
00:49:58,950 --> 00:50:07,770
city Asian emerged so and you can see

1204
00:50:01,589 --> 00:50:10,380
echoes of that here so so back to the

1205
00:50:07,770 --> 00:50:12,180
story of Jacob and his ladder so that I

1206
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:14,460
can come again to my father's house in

1207
00:50:12,180 --> 00:50:15,960
peace then shall the Lord be my god and

1208
00:50:14,460 --> 00:50:17,910
this stone which I have set for a pillar

1209
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:19,410
shall be God's house and of all that

1210
00:50:17,910 --> 00:50:22,500
that thou shalt give me I will surely

1211
00:50:19,410 --> 00:50:25,099
give the tenth unto thee so that's

1212
00:50:22,500 --> 00:50:28,319
that's also an echo I would say of the

1213
00:50:25,099 --> 00:50:30,750
obligation of those who climb the power

1214
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:33,480
higher hierarchy to attend to those who

1215
00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:35,220
are at the bottom right because if you

1216
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:37,619
think about the tithing as a form of

1217
00:50:35,220 --> 00:50:40,619
wealth distribution which is essentially

1218
00:50:37,619 --> 00:50:43,650
what it is the part of the ethic that

1219
00:50:40,619 --> 00:50:48,150
defines the proper moral endeavor that's

1220
00:50:43,650 --> 00:50:50,250
related to that Center is not to advance

1221
00:50:48,150 --> 00:50:52,829
yourself at the expense of the entire

1222
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:55,680
community so if you're if you're

1223
00:50:52,829 --> 00:50:58,260
fortunate enough so that you can rise in

1224
00:50:55,680 --> 00:51:00,540
in authority and power and competence

1225
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:04,230
within the confines of a community you

1226
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:05,970
still have a obligation to maintain the

1227
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:07,559
structure maintain and further the

1228
00:51:05,970 --> 00:51:09,630
structure of the community within which

1229
00:51:07,559 --> 00:51:11,790
you rose now that's obvious right

1230
00:51:09,630 --> 00:51:13,140
because if people didn't do that after a

1231
00:51:11,790 --> 00:51:16,140
couple of generations the whole thing

1232
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:19,559
would fall apart so you know you you you

1233
00:51:16,140 --> 00:51:22,020
it's it's not reasonable to destroy the

1234
00:51:19,559 --> 00:51:23,549
game that you're winning it's reasonable

1235
00:51:22,020 --> 00:51:26,810
to strengthen the game that you're

1236
00:51:23,549 --> 00:51:28,460
winning and so that's another thing

1237
00:51:26,810 --> 00:51:30,530
that also describes the ethic that

1238
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:34,490
should allow you to be an active member

1239
00:51:30,530 --> 00:51:38,510
of the community around which that that

1240
00:51:34,490 --> 00:51:39,740
gathers around that Center so so so one

1241
00:51:38,510 --> 00:51:41,600
of the things I've learned about the

1242
00:51:39,740 --> 00:51:44,300
hero mythology that I really really like

1243
00:51:41,600 --> 00:51:46,850
is so you see this pretty clearly in the

1244
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:50,390
figure of Christ but because two things

1245
00:51:46,850 --> 00:51:52,910
are conjoined in that story but Christ

1246
00:51:50,390 --> 00:51:54,230
is also the here there's two kinds of

1247
00:51:52,910 --> 00:51:56,720
heroes say there's the hero that goes

1248
00:51:54,230 --> 00:51:59,990
out into chaos and confronts the dragon

1249
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:01,460
of chaos and gathers the the treasure as

1250
00:51:59,990 --> 00:52:03,710
a consequence and then shares it with

1251
00:52:01,460 --> 00:52:05,630
the community that's that's that's one

1252
00:52:03,710 --> 00:52:08,530
the other form of hero is the hero who

1253
00:52:05,630 --> 00:52:11,540
stands up against the corrupt state and

1254
00:52:08,530 --> 00:52:13,610
rattles the foundation of the state has

1255
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:15,710
it collapse and then reconstructs it

1256
00:52:13,610 --> 00:52:19,340
right so because the two great dangers

1257
00:52:15,710 --> 00:52:21,410
to human beings are unprotected exposure

1258
00:52:19,340 --> 00:52:24,170
to the catastrophes of the natural world

1259
00:52:21,410 --> 00:52:26,930
and subjugation to tyranny right those

1260
00:52:24,170 --> 00:52:30,610
are the two major dangers and so a hero

1261
00:52:26,930 --> 00:52:32,840
is their ultimate hero is the person who

1262
00:52:30,610 --> 00:52:34,790
reconstructs the structure of the state

1263
00:52:32,840 --> 00:52:36,320
by using the information that he

1264
00:52:34,790 --> 00:52:39,200
gathered by going out into the unknown

1265
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:43,850
that unites them both and so what that

1266
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:46,610
means here's that here's the rub as far

1267
00:52:43,850 --> 00:52:50,900
as I can tell so a structure a center

1268
00:52:46,610 --> 00:52:52,970
has two risks associated with it one is

1269
00:52:50,900 --> 00:52:55,310
that it will degenerate into chaos and

1270
00:52:52,970 --> 00:52:59,440
the other is that we'll rigidify into

1271
00:52:55,310 --> 00:53:02,450
tyranny and it'll degenerate into chaos

1272
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:04,520
even if it just stays doing what it's

1273
00:53:02,450 --> 00:53:06,710
doing so if it just does exactly what

1274
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:07,340
it's doing and it doesn't change it will

1275
00:53:06,710 --> 00:53:10,430
degenerate

1276
00:53:07,340 --> 00:53:12,560
because things change and if it doesn't

1277
00:53:10,430 --> 00:53:14,330
change to keep up then it gets farther

1278
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:17,540
and farther away from the environment

1279
00:53:14,330 --> 00:53:19,280
and it'll precipitously collapse and so

1280
00:53:17,540 --> 00:53:23,000
and then if it just changes willy-nilly

1281
00:53:19,280 --> 00:53:25,550
so that nobody can establish a stable

1282
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:27,770
centralized a game then it degenerates

1283
00:53:25,550 --> 00:53:31,280
into chaos immediately and no one can

1284
00:53:27,770 --> 00:53:33,050
get along so there's a rule for being

1285
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:35,900
longing to the community and the rule

1286
00:53:33,050 --> 00:53:39,860
has to be that you have to act in a

1287
00:53:35,900 --> 00:53:40,730
manner that sustains and that sustains

1288
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:42,830
the community and

1289
00:53:40,730 --> 00:53:45,110
increases its competence that's the

1290
00:53:42,830 --> 00:53:47,630
fundamental moral obligation for

1291
00:53:45,110 --> 00:53:49,760
belonging and well and obviously soul

1292
00:53:47,630 --> 00:53:51,920
right because why would you belong to a

1293
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:54,440
why would you walk into a clubhouse that

1294
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:56,480
was on fire like that's just not smart

1295
00:53:54,440 --> 00:53:59,030
right if you're gonna be part of the

1296
00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:01,040
game if you've decided that being part

1297
00:53:59,030 --> 00:54:05,540
of the game is worthwhile you've also

1298
00:54:01,040 --> 00:54:07,580
taken on the moral you've also decided

1299
00:54:05,540 --> 00:54:09,200
even if you didn't notice it that you

1300
00:54:07,580 --> 00:54:11,090
have to work to support that game

1301
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:14,060
because by deciding to play that game

1302
00:54:11,090 --> 00:54:15,650
you've said that it's valuable and if

1303
00:54:14,060 --> 00:54:18,500
it's valuable then obviously you should

1304
00:54:15,650 --> 00:54:20,240
work to sustain and expand it because

1305
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:21,470
that's the definition of having a

1306
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:25,630
relationship with something that's

1307
00:54:21,470 --> 00:54:28,820
valuable and so that's the criteria for

1308
00:54:25,630 --> 00:54:32,360
membership in the community and that's

1309
00:54:28,820 --> 00:54:35,450
partly why if you regard the cross say

1310
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:37,220
as the symbol of voluntary suffering you

1311
00:54:35,450 --> 00:54:39,920
know suffering accept it voluntarily

1312
00:54:37,220 --> 00:54:41,720
something like that which is means that

1313
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:43,970
there's another element of that too

1314
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:45,980
that's worth thinking about so you know

1315
00:54:43,970 --> 00:54:48,590
the reason that cane gets so out of hand

1316
00:54:45,980 --> 00:54:50,270
is because he's suffering and he won't

1317
00:54:48,590 --> 00:54:52,310
accept it he certainly won't accept

1318
00:54:50,270 --> 00:54:54,590
responsibility for it he's angry and

1319
00:54:52,310 --> 00:54:56,480
bitter about it and no wonder right I

1320
00:54:54,590 --> 00:54:58,670
mean we have to be realistic about these

1321
00:54:56,480 --> 00:55:00,110
sorts of things there you guys all of

1322
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:02,510
you people are gonna suffer at some

1323
00:55:00,110 --> 00:55:04,460
point in your life to the point where

1324
00:55:02,510 --> 00:55:05,930
you're angry and bitter about it I mean

1325
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:07,970
there's just absolutely no doubt about

1326
00:55:05,930 --> 00:55:10,370
that and you're even gonna think well

1327
00:55:07,970 --> 00:55:12,320
it's no bloody wonder that I'm angry and

1328
00:55:10,370 --> 00:55:15,140
bitter about it everyone would be and

1329
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:17,030
things are so god-awful that there's no

1330
00:55:15,140 --> 00:55:19,820
excuse for them to even exist

1331
00:55:17,030 --> 00:55:22,280
and like that's a powerful argument

1332
00:55:19,820 --> 00:55:24,440
although I think it's ultimately

1333
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:27,950
self-defeating well that's kind of what

1334
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:29,960
the story of Cain and Abel that's kind

1335
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:31,970
of what the story of Cain and Abel what

1336
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:36,710
would you say that's the moral of the

1337
00:55:31,970 --> 00:55:38,480
story of Cain and Abel essentially so

1338
00:55:36,710 --> 00:55:40,010
what that means instead is that even

1339
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:42,140
under those conditions of relatively

1340
00:55:40,010 --> 00:55:43,940
intense suffering you have to accept it

1341
00:55:42,140 --> 00:55:46,820
voluntarily because otherwise it turns

1342
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:49,220
you against being and then you start to

1343
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:51,530
act in this terrible manner that makes

1344
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:53,240
everything worse and it seems to me that

1345
00:55:51,530 --> 00:55:54,560
there's a contradiction in that if if

1346
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:57,320
the reason you're complaining

1347
00:55:54,560 --> 00:55:59,240
that things are bad then it isn't

1348
00:55:57,320 --> 00:56:02,330
reasonable for you to act in a manner

1349
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:04,310
that makes them worse right I mean even

1350
00:56:02,330 --> 00:56:07,130
if it's no wonder that people do that

1351
00:56:04,310 --> 00:56:10,670
but it's it's a degenerating game and so

1352
00:56:07,130 --> 00:56:12,950
that's so the the idea

1353
00:56:10,670 --> 00:56:15,620
part of the idea of the cross and the

1354
00:56:12,950 --> 00:56:17,560
suffering that it represents is that if

1355
00:56:15,620 --> 00:56:20,990
you can accept that voluntarily

1356
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:24,290
regardless of its intensity then you

1357
00:56:20,990 --> 00:56:27,170
won't become embittered and resentful

1358
00:56:24,290 --> 00:56:28,880
and vengeful to the point where you pose

1359
00:56:27,170 --> 00:56:32,060
a danger to the stability of the

1360
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:34,010
community so or to your own stability

1361
00:56:32,060 --> 00:56:35,390
for that matter cuz it's you know it

1362
00:56:34,010 --> 00:56:37,040
might be your own stability the

1363
00:56:35,390 --> 00:56:38,420
stability of your family the stability

1364
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:40,750
of the community and the stability of

1365
00:56:38,420 --> 00:56:42,880
the world it might be all of that and

1366
00:56:40,750 --> 00:56:52,280
increasingly I think it is all of that

1367
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:58,640
so okay so now Jacob we get the second

1368
00:56:52,280 --> 00:57:02,840
part of Jacob story he goes to meet his

1369
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:05,630
uncle Lebon and he meets Rachel there

1370
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:06,770
again by oh well he falls in love and

1371
00:57:05,630 --> 00:57:09,770
goes to live with

1372
00:57:06,770 --> 00:57:13,910
levan there are two daughters there Leah

1373
00:57:09,770 --> 00:57:16,250
as well as Rachel Leah is not a

1374
00:57:13,910 --> 00:57:18,650
particularly attractive person it isn't

1375
00:57:16,250 --> 00:57:20,090
exactly clear why but the story makes it

1376
00:57:18,650 --> 00:57:23,570
quite clear she's definitely the least

1377
00:57:20,090 --> 00:57:25,880
desirable of the two daughters and the

1378
00:57:23,570 --> 00:57:27,230
story makes reference to her eyes and it

1379
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:28,790
isn't clear if there's something wrong

1380
00:57:27,230 --> 00:57:30,950
with her physiologically or if there's

1381
00:57:28,790 --> 00:57:32,300
something wrong with her attitude it's

1382
00:57:30,950 --> 00:57:34,790
not obvious but doesn't really matter

1383
00:57:32,300 --> 00:57:38,420
the point is she's the older daughter

1384
00:57:34,790 --> 00:57:40,940
but she's the less desirable one Jacob

1385
00:57:38,420 --> 00:57:44,150
stays a month which is the limit of

1386
00:57:40,940 --> 00:57:46,010
hospitality in in that time if you

1387
00:57:44,150 --> 00:57:47,360
stayed for a month you were welcome but

1388
00:57:46,010 --> 00:57:49,130
you had to work for your keep I think

1389
00:57:47,360 --> 00:57:50,960
after about three days something like

1390
00:57:49,130 --> 00:57:55,220
that which seems rather reasonable and

1391
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:58,100
so he stays a month and then he has a

1392
00:57:55,220 --> 00:57:59,630
chat with Lebon and he says he's fallen

1393
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:03,410
in love with Rachel by this time and he

1394
00:57:59,630 --> 00:58:06,920
says I'll stay with you and work for

1395
00:58:03,410 --> 00:58:07,700
seven years and then all weird Rachel if

1396
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:09,380
and

1397
00:58:07,700 --> 00:58:13,940
the band says that's a fine deal and

1398
00:58:09,380 --> 00:58:15,380
then the seven years passes and there's

1399
00:58:13,940 --> 00:58:22,339
a wedding ceremony it's quite a long

1400
00:58:15,380 --> 00:58:25,160
thing and the bride is veiled and the

1401
00:58:22,339 --> 00:58:27,500
bride goes into the tent with with Jacob

1402
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:30,609
and if I remember the story correctly I

1403
00:58:27,500 --> 00:58:35,900
haven't looked at it for a month or so

1404
00:58:30,609 --> 00:58:39,109
rachel is outside the tent speaking but

1405
00:58:35,900 --> 00:58:41,480
leah is inside the tent and so Jacob

1406
00:58:39,109 --> 00:58:42,770
thinks he's getting married to Rachel

1407
00:58:41,480 --> 00:58:45,950
but he's actually getting married to

1408
00:58:42,770 --> 00:58:48,560
Leah and this is it's an inversion a

1409
00:58:45,950 --> 00:58:51,260
because he's in the dark like Isaac was

1410
00:58:48,560 --> 00:58:53,180
when he fooled Isaac so now it's Jacob's

1411
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:55,450
turn to be in the dark and he gets

1412
00:58:53,180 --> 00:58:59,390
betrayed by his uncle and his

1413
00:58:55,450 --> 00:59:01,730
bride-to-be Rachel and her sister in a

1414
00:58:59,390 --> 00:59:04,250
manner that's broadly parallel to the

1415
00:59:01,730 --> 00:59:07,099
trick that he pulled on Esau and so

1416
00:59:04,250 --> 00:59:09,079
there's a karma notion there which I

1417
00:59:07,099 --> 00:59:13,099
which I'd like you know I mean you might

1418
00:59:09,079 --> 00:59:17,359
think of karma as a superstitious idea

1419
00:59:13,099 --> 00:59:19,160
but and there are ways of interpreting

1420
00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:21,520
it that might make it the case but I

1421
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:24,410
don't think that's what it is it's that

1422
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:29,780
no bad deed goes unpunished it's

1423
00:59:24,410 --> 00:59:31,190
something like that it's like you know

1424
00:59:29,780 --> 00:59:33,680
maybe you've done something bad to

1425
00:59:31,190 --> 00:59:35,319
someone and therefore there's part of

1426
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:40,520
you that feels quite guilty about that

1427
00:59:35,319 --> 00:59:43,730
hopefully and that part is looking for

1428
00:59:40,520 --> 00:59:47,599
punishment to set the stage right and

1429
00:59:43,730 --> 00:59:50,030
you might think well no but things are

1430
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:52,190
yes unless you're a psychopath that's

1431
00:59:50,030 --> 00:59:53,270
how things work if you're interested in

1432
00:59:52,190 --> 00:59:54,410
that kind of thing you should read

1433
00:59:53,270 --> 00:59:56,599
Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment

1434
00:59:54,410 --> 00:59:58,640
because it's the definitive study of

1435
00:59:56,599 --> 01:00:00,290
that sort of phenomena right because in

1436
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:02,990
that book the main protagonist

1437
01:00:00,290 --> 01:00:05,900
Raskolnikov gets away with murder like

1438
01:00:02,990 --> 01:00:08,420
he does it successfully no one suspects

1439
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:12,140
him and he drives himself so crazy with

1440
01:00:08,420 --> 01:00:13,760
guilt that he basically falls into the

1441
01:00:12,140 --> 01:00:16,220
hands of the police he drives himself

1442
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:18,140
into the hands of the police because he

1443
01:00:16,220 --> 01:00:20,390
can't tolerate what he did it's very

1444
01:00:18,140 --> 01:00:23,060
it's amazing it's amazing book but

1445
01:00:20,390 --> 01:00:26,000
anyways the point is he

1446
01:00:23,060 --> 01:00:29,550
Jakub falls prey to the same sort of

1447
01:00:26,000 --> 01:00:33,000
crookedness that he used to ratchet

1448
01:00:29,550 --> 01:00:35,070
himself up the ladder and that happens

1449
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:36,900
far more often in life and people think

1450
01:00:35,070 --> 01:00:38,760
and it's really not like he can complain

1451
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:42,300
about it right not if he has any sense

1452
01:00:38,760 --> 01:00:46,500
it's like he does he brings Leah out to

1453
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:49,530
see Lebon and he says what's what's with

1454
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:54,200
this sister you know and Lebon basically

1455
01:00:49,530 --> 01:00:56,880
says to him in our culture it's the

1456
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:59,490
custom to marry the eldest daughter

1457
01:00:56,880 --> 01:01:01,080
first which is exactly right and he said

1458
01:00:59,490 --> 01:01:02,760
well it would bring you know he's

1459
01:01:01,080 --> 01:01:05,310
rationalizing obviously because he's

1460
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:08,990
just screwed over Jacob in a major way

1461
01:01:05,310 --> 01:01:11,160
but it's a little late to take it back

1462
01:01:08,990 --> 01:01:13,770
that the marriage has been consummated

1463
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:15,840
and the ceremony has been complete and

1464
01:01:13,770 --> 01:01:20,420
all hell would break out if there was

1465
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:22,170
any attempt to sever the relationship so

1466
01:01:20,420 --> 01:01:26,010
that's how it is

1467
01:01:22,170 --> 01:01:29,520
so Leah's married and Jacob has the

1468
01:01:26,010 --> 01:01:32,070
wrong wife so then so this is Jacob

1469
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:34,020
there you see on the left he's got the

1470
01:01:32,070 --> 01:01:37,200
little flowery hat and he's pointing to

1471
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:39,650
Leah and he's saying like what what's up

1472
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:39,650
here

1473
01:01:41,579 --> 01:01:47,680
and love the band you know Laband 'is

1474
01:01:44,859 --> 01:01:49,150
tough old goat and he's not really all

1475
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:54,190
that sad about it in fact you can

1476
01:01:49,150 --> 01:01:57,420
imagine that he's kinda good so so okay

1477
01:01:54,190 --> 01:02:02,050
then he has to work another seven years

1478
01:01:57,420 --> 01:02:05,320
and he gains rachel but because god is a

1479
01:02:02,050 --> 01:02:07,800
tricky character there's another twist

1480
01:02:05,320 --> 01:02:10,599
in this story Rachel

1481
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:13,359
turns out not to be very good at having

1482
01:02:10,599 --> 01:02:14,619
children or Rachel and Jacob turn out

1483
01:02:13,359 --> 01:02:18,010
not to be very good at having children

1484
01:02:14,619 --> 01:02:23,950
but Leah she's really good at having

1485
01:02:18,010 --> 01:02:26,859
kids so she provides Jacob with Reuben

1486
01:02:23,950 --> 01:02:30,220
Simeon Levi or let's leave I believe and

1487
01:02:26,859 --> 01:02:32,109
Judah and the names of those meanings of

1488
01:02:30,220 --> 01:02:34,960
those names are there Reuben means see a

1489
01:02:32,109 --> 01:02:36,460
son Simeon means hearing though I think

1490
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:37,990
that was the Lord heard my prayer I

1491
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:40,510
think that's what that was

1492
01:02:37,990 --> 01:02:44,859
Levi means joined Judah means praise to

1493
01:02:40,510 --> 01:02:47,290
yahwah and it's Judah from whose tribe

1494
01:02:44,859 --> 01:02:49,180
Christ arises Judah is essentially

1495
01:02:47,290 --> 01:02:51,460
promoted to the status of firstborn

1496
01:02:49,180 --> 01:02:55,869
later in the story this is important

1497
01:02:51,460 --> 01:02:58,180
because Reuben Simeon and Levy all do

1498
01:02:55,869 --> 01:03:02,230
something reprehensible and so Judah

1499
01:02:58,180 --> 01:03:05,619
gets gets promoted to firstborn and

1500
01:03:02,230 --> 01:03:07,630
that's partly why in the logic of this

1501
01:03:05,619 --> 01:03:13,750
narrative that it's from the tribe of

1502
01:03:07,630 --> 01:03:15,490
Judah that Christ arises so so now while

1503
01:03:13,750 --> 01:03:17,530
this is going on Rachel is like

1504
01:03:15,490 --> 01:03:19,839
suicidally desperate for children she's

1505
01:03:17,530 --> 01:03:21,910
jealous of her older sister who's rather

1506
01:03:19,839 --> 01:03:24,069
ill-favored as we pointed out but who

1507
01:03:21,910 --> 01:03:28,060
seems to be damn good at producing sons

1508
01:03:24,069 --> 01:03:30,220
and she's really not happy with Jacob

1509
01:03:28,060 --> 01:03:31,630
and so she choose him out and Jacob

1510
01:03:30,220 --> 01:03:33,670
basically says like what do you want me

1511
01:03:31,630 --> 01:03:37,119
to do about it I'm not God which is a

1512
01:03:33,670 --> 01:03:40,240
reasonable response I would say and so

1513
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:43,000
in her desperation she gives Jacob illa

1514
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:47,829
who's her maidservant we've seen that

1515
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:50,380
sort of thing happened before and -

1516
01:03:47,829 --> 01:03:51,849
Billa produces two children Dan and Neff

1517
01:03:50,380 --> 01:03:53,710
Kelly

1518
01:03:51,849 --> 01:03:54,789
the reason I'm detailing out all these

1519
01:03:53,710 --> 01:03:57,009
sons it's

1520
01:03:54,789 --> 01:04:00,279
Gordon because Jacob is the founder of

1521
01:03:57,009 --> 01:04:03,339
Israel and his sons are the founder of

1522
01:04:00,279 --> 01:04:05,439
the 12 tribes so it's a pivotal moment

1523
01:04:03,339 --> 01:04:08,199
in the story right it's it's because

1524
01:04:05,439 --> 01:04:11,169
he's that he's the fundamental patriarch

1525
01:04:08,199 --> 01:04:13,059
of of those who wrestle with God because

1526
01:04:11,169 --> 01:04:15,640
as we'll see that's what the name Israel

1527
01:04:13,059 --> 01:04:19,119
means he gets the name Israel you'll see

1528
01:04:15,640 --> 01:04:21,039
why in a while but but it's you need to

1529
01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:23,499
know these genealogies in this situation

1530
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:28,319
because they play an important role in

1531
01:04:23,499 --> 01:04:28,319
everything that happens afterwards so

1532
01:04:28,859 --> 01:04:35,019
Naphtali is the second and her name or

1533
01:04:32,979 --> 01:04:36,729
his name means with great wrestling's I

1534
01:04:35,019 --> 01:04:40,619
have wrestled with my sister right

1535
01:04:36,729 --> 01:04:42,969
contended with her and have prevailed so

1536
01:04:40,619 --> 01:04:45,699
that gives you some indication of the

1537
01:04:42,969 --> 01:04:47,859
tension in the household now

1538
01:04:45,699 --> 01:04:51,279
leah is now past bearing children she

1539
01:04:47,859 --> 01:04:53,499
gives Jake Jacob her maidservant to

1540
01:04:51,279 --> 01:04:59,799
Zilpah to keep up with her sister I

1541
01:04:53,499 --> 01:05:02,049
guess and now Zilpah bares to children

1542
01:04:59,799 --> 01:05:05,650
for Jacob so he's piling up the kids

1543
01:05:02,049 --> 01:05:07,479
left right and center here one of them

1544
01:05:05,650 --> 01:05:11,309
is named gad good fortune and the other

1545
01:05:07,479 --> 01:05:13,839
is named Asher happy or blessed so

1546
01:05:11,309 --> 01:05:15,609
there's more rivalry going on between

1547
01:05:13,839 --> 01:05:18,939
the sisters this is quite an interesting

1548
01:05:15,609 --> 01:05:21,999
little story so Reuben who's Lea's

1549
01:05:18,939 --> 01:05:24,189
daughter goes out and looks for

1550
01:05:21,999 --> 01:05:26,199
Mandrake's now Mandrake's have

1551
01:05:24,189 --> 01:05:28,929
aphrodisiac property so that's a little

1552
01:05:26,199 --> 01:05:35,079
odd to begin with but it doesn't matter

1553
01:05:28,929 --> 01:05:36,759
that's what happens and Rachel is Rachel

1554
01:05:35,079 --> 01:05:38,499
wants the Mandrake's because she's still

1555
01:05:36,759 --> 01:05:41,259
interested in having some children and

1556
01:05:38,499 --> 01:05:43,269
so she bargains with Leah to give her a

1557
01:05:41,259 --> 01:05:47,589
night with Jacob in exchange for the

1558
01:05:43,269 --> 01:05:48,819
Mandrake's and more sons emerge as a

1559
01:05:47,589 --> 01:05:53,729
consequence of that

1560
01:05:48,819 --> 01:05:57,819
so then Rachel finally gives birth

1561
01:05:53,729 --> 01:06:01,269
Joseph and Joseph plays a key role in

1562
01:05:57,819 --> 01:06:02,949
the last story in Genesis which I hope

1563
01:06:01,269 --> 01:06:05,439
we'll get to in the next lecture and

1564
01:06:02,949 --> 01:06:08,780
then we can close off Genesis that's the

1565
01:06:05,439 --> 01:06:11,300
plan anyways so now

1566
01:06:08,780 --> 01:06:13,250
Jacob isn't really very happy about the

1567
01:06:11,300 --> 01:06:15,350
whole arrangement because he he's been

1568
01:06:13,250 --> 01:06:17,420
there 14 years and he's got two wives

1569
01:06:15,350 --> 01:06:20,090
it's not too bad but he you know he got

1570
01:06:17,420 --> 01:06:21,980
he the bargain wasn't exactly clean

1571
01:06:20,090 --> 01:06:25,540
he doesn't really trust la Bannon and

1572
01:06:21,980 --> 01:06:28,580
there's no reason for him to do so

1573
01:06:25,540 --> 01:06:31,880
levan was poor before Jacob came Jacob

1574
01:06:28,580 --> 01:06:34,700
turns out to be a very useful person to

1575
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:36,080
have around and so he tells Lebon he

1576
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:38,960
wants to leave and go back to his home

1577
01:06:36,080 --> 01:06:41,060
country and that he'll take the speckled

1578
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:43,340
and spotted cattle the brown sheep and

1579
01:06:41,060 --> 01:06:45,260
the spotted and speckled goats from the

1580
01:06:43,340 --> 01:06:48,530
flock and they're in the minority so

1581
01:06:45,260 --> 01:06:50,810
that's the idea and sola ban or lab and

1582
01:06:48,530 --> 01:06:53,420
takes all those animals out of his flock

1583
01:06:50,810 --> 01:06:55,700
so there was an idea that the speckled

1584
01:06:53,420 --> 01:07:00,470
goats and the brown sheep would breed

1585
01:06:55,700 --> 01:07:02,270
true so if you have two male goat and a

1586
01:07:00,470 --> 01:07:03,770
female goat and they're both speckled

1587
01:07:02,270 --> 01:07:06,050
they'll have speckled kids that's the

1588
01:07:03,770 --> 01:07:07,700
theory and the same with brown sheep and

1589
01:07:06,050 --> 01:07:11,600
so what Lebon does is he takes all the

1590
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:13,640
speckled animals out of the flocks gives

1591
01:07:11,600 --> 01:07:15,410
them to his son and they go three days

1592
01:07:13,640 --> 01:07:18,560
away with them so that Jacob is left

1593
01:07:15,410 --> 01:07:20,420
with the flock but with no with none of

1594
01:07:18,560 --> 01:07:22,160
these animals now the idea was that all

1595
01:07:20,420 --> 01:07:24,290
the what newborns were going to be his

1596
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:28,010
and so what Lebon is basically done is

1597
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:30,110
set it up so that in principle Jacob is

1598
01:07:28,010 --> 01:07:32,260
going to get nothing for his work so

1599
01:07:30,110 --> 01:07:35,630
that's another time when Jacob

1600
01:07:32,260 --> 01:07:37,180
experiences betrayal you know it's

1601
01:07:35,630 --> 01:07:40,340
almost as if God isn't done with

1602
01:07:37,180 --> 01:07:43,010
reminding him of the magnitude of what

1603
01:07:40,340 --> 01:07:45,320
he did in the past that that's the moral

1604
01:07:43,010 --> 01:07:47,030
of the story in some sense now there's a

1605
01:07:45,320 --> 01:07:49,070
weird little twist in the story here so

1606
01:07:47,030 --> 01:07:51,740
what Jacob does is some sympathetic

1607
01:07:49,070 --> 01:07:54,830
magic and so when the animals are

1608
01:07:51,740 --> 01:07:56,630
rutting he puts speckled objects in

1609
01:07:54,830 --> 01:07:58,700
front of them speckled branches and so

1610
01:07:56,630 --> 01:08:00,050
forth I guess to remind them about what

1611
01:07:58,700 --> 01:08:02,630
they're supposed to be producing

1612
01:08:00,050 --> 01:08:05,210
something like that and it works and so

1613
01:08:02,630 --> 01:08:08,630
all these animals that Lebon left are

1614
01:08:05,210 --> 01:08:11,660
are producing spotted animals like mad

1615
01:08:08,630 --> 01:08:14,870
and so that's I guess God's changed his

1616
01:08:11,660 --> 01:08:19,670
mind and let Jacob off the hook slightly

1617
01:08:14,870 --> 01:08:22,060
here so soon he was very wealthy much

1618
01:08:19,670 --> 01:08:25,240
cattle maidservants men servants camels

1619
01:08:22,060 --> 01:08:27,069
analysis Laban's son sons become jealous

1620
01:08:25,240 --> 01:08:28,660
and Lebon is outraged well you know

1621
01:08:27,069 --> 01:08:30,280
obviously there's some competition there

1622
01:08:28,660 --> 01:08:32,170
between Jacob and the sons which is

1623
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:34,390
hardly surprising and the blonde played

1624
01:08:32,170 --> 01:08:36,580
this trick to strip Jacob of all his

1625
01:08:34,390 --> 01:08:37,960
property and instead he got far more

1626
01:08:36,580 --> 01:08:39,460
than he was going to get to begin with

1627
01:08:37,960 --> 01:08:41,770
so you can imagine that's been a bit

1628
01:08:39,460 --> 01:08:44,109
annoying so Jacob thinks he better get

1629
01:08:41,770 --> 01:08:46,839
out of there so he tells Rachel and Leah

1630
01:08:44,109 --> 01:08:48,970
and said unto them I see your father's

1631
01:08:46,839 --> 01:08:51,609
countenance that is not toward me as

1632
01:08:48,970 --> 01:08:53,530
before but the god of my father has been

1633
01:08:51,609 --> 01:08:55,359
with me and you know with all my power

1634
01:08:53,530 --> 01:08:57,280
I've served your father and your father

1635
01:08:55,359 --> 01:09:00,040
has deceived me and changed my wages ten

1636
01:08:57,280 --> 01:09:00,970
times but God so far has suffered him

1637
01:09:00,040 --> 01:09:04,030
not to hurt me

1638
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:06,100
if he said thus the speckled shall be

1639
01:09:04,030 --> 01:09:08,140
thy wages then all the cattle bore

1640
01:09:06,100 --> 01:09:10,480
speckled and if he said thus the

1641
01:09:08,140 --> 01:09:12,940
ringstraked shall be thy hire then all

1642
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:14,800
the cattle bore ringstraked thus God has

1643
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:17,620
taken away the cattle of your father and

1644
01:09:14,800 --> 01:09:20,500
given them to me and they decide to

1645
01:09:17,620 --> 01:09:22,420
sneak away and they're unhappy with the

1646
01:09:20,500 --> 01:09:23,800
inheritance lack of inheritance from the

1647
01:09:22,420 --> 01:09:26,650
man so as they sneak away

1648
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:29,470
Rachel steals the idols that her father

1649
01:09:26,650 --> 01:09:31,990
has in his house and it's not exactly

1650
01:09:29,470 --> 01:09:33,609
obvious why there's a lot of contention

1651
01:09:31,990 --> 01:09:36,910
about why she's doing that some of them

1652
01:09:33,609 --> 01:09:38,680
is to punish him to bring with her the

1653
01:09:36,910 --> 01:09:40,359
images of her ancestors you know maybe

1654
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:42,970
she's lonesome moving away from home

1655
01:09:40,359 --> 01:09:45,520
just out of spite to show him that the

1656
01:09:42,970 --> 01:09:47,530
idols were actually powerless for

1657
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:49,690
protection to stop her father from

1658
01:09:47,530 --> 01:09:51,520
divining the route of their escape that

1659
01:09:49,690 --> 01:09:53,710
last one is the strangest one because

1660
01:09:51,520 --> 01:09:57,850
the idea would be that Lebon would have

1661
01:09:53,710 --> 01:09:59,980
used some sort of ritual with the idols

1662
01:09:57,850 --> 01:10:01,510
that would help him infer their escape

1663
01:09:59,980 --> 01:10:03,070
route and then could chase them so

1664
01:10:01,510 --> 01:10:05,530
anyways that's the range of speculation

1665
01:10:03,070 --> 01:10:08,310
about that I think it sounds to me

1666
01:10:05,530 --> 01:10:12,840
mostly like a little act of revenge

1667
01:10:08,310 --> 01:10:16,630
maybe with a bit of loneliness mixed in

1668
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:17,950
Laband pursues them but God comes in a

1669
01:10:16,630 --> 01:10:20,890
dream to tell him to leave Jacob

1670
01:10:17,950 --> 01:10:22,570
unharmed hmm LaVon catches up with him

1671
01:10:20,890 --> 01:10:25,120
and reproaches Jacob saying that he

1672
01:10:22,570 --> 01:10:26,590
would have thrown a great party if he

1673
01:10:25,120 --> 01:10:28,360
would have known that they were going to

1674
01:10:26,590 --> 01:10:30,250
leave you know he didn't want them to

1675
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:31,990
sneak away in the night and you can't

1676
01:10:30,250 --> 01:10:33,760
tell from the story whether that's true

1677
01:10:31,990 --> 01:10:35,679
or not and you know these people were

1678
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:37,810
pretty rough and

1679
01:10:35,679 --> 01:10:40,480
pulse of I would say and maybe there was

1680
01:10:37,810 --> 01:10:42,940
a 50% chance of a slaughter and a 50%

1681
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:47,679
chance of a party who knows I've been to

1682
01:10:42,940 --> 01:10:49,510
parties like that actually so Laband

1683
01:10:47,679 --> 01:10:51,850
complains that his gods are gone and

1684
01:10:49,510 --> 01:10:52,780
Jacob says that whoever has them he will

1685
01:10:51,850 --> 01:10:55,659
have them killed

1686
01:10:52,780 --> 01:10:58,540
and Rachel who's really quite a sneaky

1687
01:10:55,659 --> 01:11:01,480
character all things consider basically

1688
01:10:58,540 --> 01:11:05,170
claims that she's having her period and

1689
01:11:01,480 --> 01:11:07,120
she's sitting on the carpet with all the

1690
01:11:05,170 --> 01:11:08,739
idols underneath and she can't move and

1691
01:11:07,120 --> 01:11:10,870
so they search everywhere and can't find

1692
01:11:08,739 --> 01:11:12,969
them and she's like laughing away behind

1693
01:11:10,870 --> 01:11:16,120
her hand about that sneaky little

1694
01:11:12,969 --> 01:11:17,489
maneuver but she doesn't die so that's

1695
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:22,060
probably a good thing

1696
01:11:17,489 --> 01:11:23,560
so the ban checks everything out checks

1697
01:11:22,060 --> 01:11:25,929
the camp out and he can't find anything

1698
01:11:23,560 --> 01:11:29,770
so they reconcile and so that's the

1699
01:11:25,929 --> 01:11:37,300
first reconciliation that Jacob engages

1700
01:11:29,770 --> 01:11:39,610
in it's sort of like the what would you

1701
01:11:37,300 --> 01:11:41,980
say the karmic dad is being paid that's

1702
01:11:39,610 --> 01:11:45,760
one way of thinking about it that's so

1703
01:11:41,980 --> 01:11:49,980
he got punished for his wrongdoing he's

1704
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:52,300
learned his lesson perhaps and it's it's

1705
01:11:49,980 --> 01:11:54,190
that's good enough as far as he's

1706
01:11:52,300 --> 01:12:00,100
concerned you know he got away good

1707
01:11:54,190 --> 01:12:02,260
enough and they make peace so then the

1708
01:12:00,100 --> 01:12:04,210
next thing that happens as they're

1709
01:12:02,260 --> 01:12:08,679
travelling is that Jacob was left alone

1710
01:12:04,210 --> 01:12:14,650
and there wrestled a man man angel God

1711
01:12:08,679 --> 01:12:16,179
it's not clear we'll go with angel with

1712
01:12:14,650 --> 01:12:18,280
them until the breaking of the day or

1713
01:12:16,179 --> 01:12:20,110
God and when he saw that he prevailed

1714
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:21,340
not against him he touched the hollow of

1715
01:12:20,110 --> 01:12:23,020
his thigh and the hollow of Jacob's

1716
01:12:21,340 --> 01:12:25,300
thigh was out of joint as he wrestled

1717
01:12:23,020 --> 01:12:27,820
with him and he said let me go for the

1718
01:12:25,300 --> 01:12:30,400
day breaks and Jacob said I will not let

1719
01:12:27,820 --> 01:12:32,860
you go unless you bless me and the angel

1720
01:12:30,400 --> 01:12:35,909
said unto him what is thy name and Jacob

1721
01:12:32,860 --> 01:12:35,909
said Jacob

1722
01:12:44,780 --> 01:12:49,730
and the angel said thy name shall no

1723
01:12:47,150 --> 01:12:52,190
more be called Jacob so the supplanter

1724
01:12:49,730 --> 01:12:55,670
right the the overthrow ur with that

1725
01:12:52,190 --> 01:12:58,160
kind of intonation of or implication of

1726
01:12:55,670 --> 01:13:00,620
crookedness but Israel which means Hui

1727
01:12:58,160 --> 01:13:02,870
who wrestles or strives successfully

1728
01:13:00,620 --> 01:13:05,210
with God for as a prince

1729
01:13:02,870 --> 01:13:07,790
hast thou power with God and with men

1730
01:13:05,210 --> 01:13:09,860
and has prevailed that's quite a story I

1731
01:13:07,790 --> 01:13:11,690
like it's it's I don't know I don't know

1732
01:13:09,860 --> 01:13:14,270
exactly what to make of it there's

1733
01:13:11,690 --> 01:13:17,030
obviously a symbolic level of meaning

1734
01:13:14,270 --> 01:13:19,880
which is that that is what human beings

1735
01:13:17,030 --> 01:13:22,010
do in some sense is they they wrestle I

1736
01:13:19,880 --> 01:13:24,620
would say they wrestle with the divine

1737
01:13:22,010 --> 01:13:30,050
even with the concept of the divine for

1738
01:13:24,620 --> 01:13:32,150
that matter and but the question is do

1739
01:13:30,050 --> 01:13:34,970
they prevail like it's got an odd thing

1740
01:13:32,150 --> 01:13:36,590
that Jacob actually seems to win this

1741
01:13:34,970 --> 01:13:39,410
battle right or at least he wins it

1742
01:13:36,590 --> 01:13:41,060
enough so that whoever he's wrestling

1743
01:13:39,410 --> 01:13:43,340
this divine figure that he's wrestling

1744
01:13:41,060 --> 01:13:45,230
is willing to bestow a blessing on him I

1745
01:13:43,340 --> 01:13:47,630
guess maybe that's a testament to his

1746
01:13:45,230 --> 01:13:50,930
courage it's something like that maybe

1747
01:13:47,630 --> 01:13:53,000
it's an indication that he has paid for

1748
01:13:50,930 --> 01:13:56,450
his sins sufficiently so that he's sort

1749
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:58,340
of back on the moral high ground but but

1750
01:13:56,450 --> 01:14:00,800
I think it's really telling that the

1751
01:13:58,340 --> 01:14:03,920
transformation of the name from Jacob to

1752
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:06,590
Israel and that what Israel means is he

1753
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:09,800
who wrestles with God or who struggles

1754
01:14:06,590 --> 01:14:11,120
with God and perhaps successfully but

1755
01:14:09,800 --> 01:14:13,550
it's also so interesting that he

1756
01:14:11,120 --> 01:14:14,900
actually emerges victorious you know you

1757
01:14:13,550 --> 01:14:16,790
wouldn't necessarily think that that

1758
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:19,520
would be a possibility especially given

1759
01:14:16,790 --> 01:14:21,110
you know God's rather hot-headed nature

1760
01:14:19,520 --> 01:14:24,080
in the Old Testament you don't wanna

1761
01:14:21,110 --> 01:14:26,270
mess with him too much but but Jacob

1762
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:28,730
does it successfully but even more

1763
01:14:26,270 --> 01:14:31,310
importantly is the idea that whatever

1764
01:14:28,730 --> 01:14:34,880
Israel constitutes which would be to say

1765
01:14:31,310 --> 01:14:37,490
the land that Jacob founds is actually

1766
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:40,280
composed of those who wrestle with God I

1767
01:14:37,490 --> 01:14:43,600
think that's an amazing idea because it

1768
01:14:40,280 --> 01:14:46,340
also seems to me to shed some light on

1769
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:48,110
perhaps what was meant by belief in

1770
01:14:46,340 --> 01:14:49,850
those days you know like I've often

1771
01:14:48,110 --> 01:14:52,100
thought of Rett of marriage as a

1772
01:14:49,850 --> 01:14:53,720
wrestling match right if you're lucky

1773
01:14:52,100 --> 01:14:56,390
the person that you marry is someone you

1774
01:14:53,720 --> 01:14:58,079
contend with it's not exactly I don't

1775
01:14:56,390 --> 01:15:01,710
think it's exactly

1776
01:14:58,079 --> 01:15:03,980
it's not tranquil precisely you know you

1777
01:15:01,710 --> 01:15:06,210
might have noticed that some of you and

1778
01:15:03,980 --> 01:15:08,820
but but the thing is if you have

1779
01:15:06,210 --> 01:15:12,210
something to contend against then that

1780
01:15:08,820 --> 01:15:14,040
strengthens you and and that's actually

1781
01:15:12,210 --> 01:15:18,150
better than having nothing to contend

1782
01:15:14,040 --> 01:15:20,309
against and so Jakob is the person who's

1783
01:15:18,150 --> 01:15:23,130
also strengthened by the necessity of

1784
01:15:20,309 --> 01:15:25,380
this contending and that seems to be the

1785
01:15:23,130 --> 01:15:28,170
proper relationship with God or the

1786
01:15:25,380 --> 01:15:31,309
angel is that contending the battling

1787
01:15:28,170 --> 01:15:36,659
right rather than some sort of kind of

1788
01:15:31,309 --> 01:15:38,309
loose weak statement of belief I mean

1789
01:15:36,659 --> 01:15:39,570
I'm not trying to denigrate that to any

1790
01:15:38,309 --> 01:15:41,940
great degree it just doesn't seem like

1791
01:15:39,570 --> 01:15:44,429
the right mode of conceptualization

1792
01:15:41,940 --> 01:15:48,510
right because human beings are aren't

1793
01:15:44,429 --> 01:15:50,280
like that were contentious creatures and

1794
01:15:48,510 --> 01:15:52,020
that's actually seems to be something

1795
01:15:50,280 --> 01:15:54,179
that meets with God's favor in this

1796
01:15:52,020 --> 01:15:56,369
situation so especially given that

1797
01:15:54,179 --> 01:15:58,199
that's actually what he names the well

1798
01:15:56,369 --> 01:16:01,440
the whole kingdom of the chosen people

1799
01:15:58,199 --> 01:16:04,949
is the idea is that that's composed of

1800
01:16:01,440 --> 01:16:07,290
those who contend with God so that's

1801
01:16:04,949 --> 01:16:13,079
that's a hell of an idea that that's for

1802
01:16:07,290 --> 01:16:15,000
sure and Jacob asked him and said tell

1803
01:16:13,079 --> 01:16:17,790
me I pray thee thy name and he said

1804
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:19,619
wherefore is it thou dost ask after my

1805
01:16:17,790 --> 01:16:21,540
name so there's no that's not happening

1806
01:16:19,619 --> 01:16:22,980
and he blessed him there and Jacob

1807
01:16:21,540 --> 01:16:25,349
called the place of the name of the

1808
01:16:22,980 --> 01:16:27,329
place Peniel for I or penny'll for I've

1809
01:16:25,349 --> 01:16:30,750
seen God face to face and my life is

1810
01:16:27,329 --> 01:16:32,520
preserved and he passed over Peniel the

1811
01:16:30,750 --> 01:16:36,690
Sun rose upon him and he halted upon his

1812
01:16:32,520 --> 01:16:39,179
thigh now Jacob does walk away it

1813
01:16:36,690 --> 01:16:41,610
injured from this right so he has a

1814
01:16:39,179 --> 01:16:44,130
permanent limp after that and so that's

1815
01:16:41,610 --> 01:16:46,590
also an indication of just how dangerous

1816
01:16:44,130 --> 01:16:48,360
that contention actually is like he gets

1817
01:16:46,590 --> 01:16:53,790
blast he wins but he doesn't get away

1818
01:16:48,360 --> 01:16:57,179
scot-free and so now so Jacob goes back

1819
01:16:53,790 --> 01:16:59,309
to Esau and he's terrified even though

1820
01:16:57,179 --> 01:17:00,750
it's been 14 years he thinks maybe his

1821
01:16:59,309 --> 01:17:02,849
heart headed brother hasn't calmed down

1822
01:17:00,750 --> 01:17:05,420
yet and he has good reason to think that

1823
01:17:02,849 --> 01:17:05,420
I would say

1824
01:17:07,130 --> 01:17:12,710
so he sends messengers to Esau who then

1825
01:17:09,890 --> 01:17:14,720
sets out with 400 men and so Jacob is

1826
01:17:12,710 --> 01:17:17,000
not very happy with this whole idea and

1827
01:17:14,720 --> 01:17:18,740
he breaks his people into two bands so

1828
01:17:17,000 --> 01:17:21,620
that maybe half of them cannot be killed

1829
01:17:18,740 --> 01:17:24,740
and then he takes from his large flocks

1830
01:17:21,620 --> 01:17:26,180
a bunch of animals and a bunch of

1831
01:17:24,740 --> 01:17:29,690
servants and he sends them out to meet

1832
01:17:26,180 --> 01:17:31,940
he saw basically to say look I'm I'm I'm

1833
01:17:29,690 --> 01:17:35,810
a jerk and sorry about the whole

1834
01:17:31,940 --> 01:17:38,450
birthright thing and and here's some

1835
01:17:35,810 --> 01:17:41,030
animals and you know maybe maybe that's

1836
01:17:38,450 --> 01:17:43,400
the beginnings of an apology it's

1837
01:17:41,030 --> 01:17:45,740
something like that and so but he's not

1838
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:49,160
very convinced that that's actually

1839
01:17:45,740 --> 01:17:51,680
going to work but he saw who actually

1840
01:17:49,160 --> 01:17:53,750
turns out to perhaps have matured in the

1841
01:17:51,680 --> 01:17:57,260
interim perhaps that's one way of

1842
01:17:53,750 --> 01:17:59,690
thinking about it meets Jacob and says

1843
01:17:57,260 --> 01:18:02,410
that just seeing him is enough but Jacob

1844
01:17:59,690 --> 01:18:05,750
insists that he takes the gift and Esau

1845
01:18:02,410 --> 01:18:09,740
accepts and which is probably a wise

1846
01:18:05,750 --> 01:18:11,570
thing because even if he saw is 95%

1847
01:18:09,740 --> 01:18:14,030
convinced that just seeing his brother

1848
01:18:11,570 --> 01:18:15,950
is enough there's probably 5% of him

1849
01:18:14,030 --> 01:18:18,530
that's still really not all that happy

1850
01:18:15,950 --> 01:18:20,570
and so you have to be careful you know

1851
01:18:18,530 --> 01:18:22,790
when you say that you forgive someone

1852
01:18:20,570 --> 01:18:24,320
because there might be a part of you

1853
01:18:22,790 --> 01:18:26,150
that really doesn't that really needs

1854
01:18:24,320 --> 01:18:29,990
something else before you can actually

1855
01:18:26,150 --> 01:18:31,280
say okay look fine you know and you

1856
01:18:29,990 --> 01:18:34,340
don't want to fool yourself about that

1857
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:36,470
because that 5% that hasn't been

1858
01:18:34,340 --> 01:18:38,630
completely convinced will find its voice

1859
01:18:36,470 --> 01:18:41,540
at some point and then maybe undermine

1860
01:18:38,630 --> 01:18:42,680
the whole reconciliation process you

1861
01:18:41,540 --> 01:18:44,630
don't want to think that you're any

1862
01:18:42,680 --> 01:18:47,810
better than you are or any nicer than

1863
01:18:44,630 --> 01:18:50,150
you are it's not helpful and so he saw a

1864
01:18:47,810 --> 01:18:52,880
smart I think so while Jacob smart to

1865
01:18:50,150 --> 01:18:58,190
say no no like thanks a lot but take the

1866
01:18:52,880 --> 01:19:00,470
damn goats and Jacob and Esau is smart

1867
01:18:58,190 --> 01:19:05,480
enough to accept that and he might do

1868
01:19:00,470 --> 01:19:07,760
that maybe - you know - please Jacob but

1869
01:19:05,480 --> 01:19:09,500
also I think so that there really is the

1870
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:11,960
possibility of establishing peace

1871
01:19:09,500 --> 01:19:14,150
because hypothetically the gift that's

1872
01:19:11,960 --> 01:19:17,450
being offered is of sufficient magnitude

1873
01:19:14,150 --> 01:19:18,860
to erase the debt of the loss of the

1874
01:19:17,450 --> 01:19:20,420
birthright it's something like that

1875
01:19:18,860 --> 01:19:22,790
right it's it's it's

1876
01:19:20,420 --> 01:19:29,330
it's it's the payment of the real debt

1877
01:19:22,790 --> 01:19:31,730
and Esau said what meanest thou by all

1878
01:19:29,330 --> 01:19:33,500
this drove which I met and Jacob said

1879
01:19:31,730 --> 01:19:36,650
these are to find grace in the sight of

1880
01:19:33,500 --> 01:19:38,810
my Lord and Esau says I have enough

1881
01:19:36,650 --> 01:19:48,890
brother keep thou keep that that thou

1882
01:19:38,810 --> 01:19:50,960
hast unto thyself and Jacob said and

1883
01:19:48,890 --> 01:19:53,330
this is interesting statement I think no

1884
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:56,440
I pray you if if I have now found grace

1885
01:19:53,330 --> 01:19:59,330
in thy sight take the present at my hand

1886
01:19:56,440 --> 01:20:01,250
for therefore I have seen thy face as

1887
01:19:59,330 --> 01:20:04,340
though I had seen the face of God and

1888
01:20:01,250 --> 01:20:08,630
now was pleased with me and so that's so

1889
01:20:04,340 --> 01:20:10,100
he's he's taking the Honorable judgment

1890
01:20:08,630 --> 01:20:12,949
of his brother because it is honorable

1891
01:20:10,100 --> 01:20:14,719
because he saw did get betrayed so he

1892
01:20:12,949 --> 01:20:19,760
has a right to be standing in judgment

1893
01:20:14,719 --> 01:20:21,860
and he equates that judgment with with

1894
01:20:19,760 --> 01:20:24,530
what would you say with the highest of

1895
01:20:21,860 --> 01:20:29,150
virtues it's appropriate judgment and so

1896
01:20:24,530 --> 01:20:31,160
he wants to make complete amends to Esau

1897
01:20:29,150 --> 01:20:36,170
as if Esau as a representative of the

1898
01:20:31,160 --> 01:20:38,330
divine element of justice and I guess

1899
01:20:36,170 --> 01:20:40,969
that's convincing to ease so it's quite

1900
01:20:38,330 --> 01:20:42,739
a thing to say you know that I need to

1901
01:20:40,969 --> 01:20:44,600
be reconciled to you because that would

1902
01:20:42,739 --> 01:20:47,570
simultaneously reconcile me with God

1903
01:20:44,600 --> 01:20:49,250
it's like it's crucial this is between

1904
01:20:47,570 --> 01:20:51,469
us but it's there's a higher principle

1905
01:20:49,250 --> 01:20:53,540
at stake that's vital and I think that

1906
01:20:51,469 --> 01:20:55,190
is the case with betrayal that's very

1907
01:20:53,540 --> 01:20:57,260
frequently the case because if you

1908
01:20:55,190 --> 01:20:59,929
betray someone you really have violated

1909
01:20:57,260 --> 01:21:02,120
you've deeply violated what can only be

1910
01:20:59,929 --> 01:21:05,060
called a sacred trust it's the right

1911
01:21:02,120 --> 01:21:07,130
terminology for that take it I pray the

1912
01:21:05,060 --> 01:21:09,230
my blessing that is brought to thee

1913
01:21:07,130 --> 01:21:11,030
because God has dealt graciously with me

1914
01:21:09,230 --> 01:21:14,929
and because I have enough and he urged

1915
01:21:11,030 --> 01:21:18,350
him and he took it so you know the story

1916
01:21:14,929 --> 01:21:22,850
seems to be something like well Jacob

1917
01:21:18,350 --> 01:21:25,640
was kind of an arrogant crooked

1918
01:21:22,850 --> 01:21:27,560
deceitful character maybe / impressed

1919
01:21:25,640 --> 01:21:30,530
with his own ability he thought it was

1920
01:21:27,560 --> 01:21:33,170
pretty amusing to pull a fast trick or

1921
01:21:30,530 --> 01:21:34,290
two on his brother then he ran off which

1922
01:21:33,170 --> 01:21:37,140
is not all that

1923
01:21:34,290 --> 01:21:39,900
brave and then he got walloped of a lot

1924
01:21:37,140 --> 01:21:41,340
and perhaps learned something and then

1925
01:21:39,900 --> 01:21:47,190
when he came back you know he was a

1926
01:21:41,340 --> 01:21:50,850
different person and so that's a that's

1927
01:21:47,190 --> 01:21:55,080
a reasonable story and you know he he

1928
01:21:50,850 --> 01:21:55,650
has to repent completely of about what

1929
01:21:55,080 --> 01:21:58,290
he did

1930
01:21:55,650 --> 01:22:01,640
before he can rectify the situation

1931
01:21:58,290 --> 01:22:04,260
properly and he's willing to do that so

1932
01:22:01,640 --> 01:22:07,290
that's an interesting idea too because

1933
01:22:04,260 --> 01:22:09,660
it's it's it's the early reflection of

1934
01:22:07,290 --> 01:22:12,300
the idea that it is if you do something

1935
01:22:09,660 --> 01:22:13,890
wrong in the past a that you can learn

1936
01:22:12,300 --> 01:22:16,470
from it right so that you're actually

1937
01:22:13,890 --> 01:22:19,920
capable of learning and be that you can

1938
01:22:16,470 --> 01:22:22,440
set the balance right in the present

1939
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:24,750
those are very optimistic ideas you know

1940
01:22:22,440 --> 01:22:27,480
because you might say well once you've

1941
01:22:24,750 --> 01:22:28,650
committed some sort of crime that's it

1942
01:22:27,480 --> 01:22:31,050
there's no hope for you but that's

1943
01:22:28,650 --> 01:22:33,540
pretty rough because the probability

1944
01:22:31,050 --> 01:22:35,070
that you've done unethical things at

1945
01:22:33,540 --> 01:22:38,360
some point in your life is a hundred

1946
01:22:35,070 --> 01:22:41,280
percent and so if there was no way of

1947
01:22:38,360 --> 01:22:48,030
setting the balance right after that

1948
01:22:41,280 --> 01:22:49,740
then everybody would be doomed so so

1949
01:22:48,030 --> 01:22:53,730
then the story gets rough again Jacob

1950
01:22:49,740 --> 01:22:55,850
settles in Shalem Shalem Dinah his

1951
01:22:53,730 --> 01:22:58,530
daughter goes looking around for friends

1952
01:22:55,850 --> 01:23:01,020
Shechem the son of Hamor lays with her

1953
01:22:58,530 --> 01:23:02,790
and then once her for his wife he

1954
01:23:01,020 --> 01:23:04,380
actually has the order reversed there

1955
01:23:02,790 --> 01:23:08,220
that turns out to be a problem

1956
01:23:04,380 --> 01:23:12,120
Jacob hears of this the fathers talk and

1957
01:23:08,220 --> 01:23:14,730
so they make an agreement the agreement

1958
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:17,060
is is that if all of hammers men

1959
01:23:14,730 --> 01:23:19,650
including hammer and his son are

1960
01:23:17,060 --> 01:23:21,480
circumcised so that's the proper

1961
01:23:19,650 --> 01:23:24,120
offering I guess that brings them into

1962
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:26,100
the familial fold and indicates that

1963
01:23:24,120 --> 01:23:29,340
they're willing to make a sacrifice to

1964
01:23:26,100 --> 01:23:31,790
do so especially after you know Shechem

1965
01:23:29,340 --> 01:23:34,260
put the cart before the horse let's say

1966
01:23:31,790 --> 01:23:36,510
the man of hammer or circumcised they

1967
01:23:34,260 --> 01:23:38,430
agree to do so that turns out to be a

1968
01:23:36,510 --> 01:23:41,250
big mistake so well they're laying

1969
01:23:38,430 --> 01:23:45,210
around the next day suffering madly from

1970
01:23:41,250 --> 01:23:47,300
the circumcision Simeon and Levi come in

1971
01:23:45,210 --> 01:23:48,800
they sneak in and kill all of them

1972
01:23:47,300 --> 01:23:53,619
and take their wealth and their women

1973
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:53,619
and children that's rough it's rough

1974
01:23:53,860 --> 01:24:02,599
yeah I guess you guys noticed that a

1975
01:23:57,040 --> 01:24:04,429
so-so at their honor societies right and

1976
01:24:02,599 --> 01:24:06,170
there's still lots of honor societies in

1977
01:24:04,429 --> 01:24:08,270
the world and so they don't take kindly

1978
01:24:06,170 --> 01:24:13,540
to what happened to their to their

1979
01:24:08,270 --> 01:24:13,540
sister although they don't kill her so

1980
01:24:13,690 --> 01:24:18,710
now it turns out that yeah it says as it

1981
01:24:17,059 --> 01:24:21,050
came to pass on the third day when they

1982
01:24:18,710 --> 01:24:22,099
were sore the two of the sons of Jacob

1983
01:24:21,050 --> 01:24:24,440
Simeon and Levi

1984
01:24:22,099 --> 01:24:26,420
Dinah's brethren took each man his sword

1985
01:24:24,440 --> 01:24:28,550
and came upon the city boldly and slew

1986
01:24:26,420 --> 01:24:30,050
all the males and they slew hamor and

1987
01:24:28,550 --> 01:24:32,150
shechem his son with the edge of the

1988
01:24:30,050 --> 01:24:35,150
sword and took Dinah out of Chekhov's

1989
01:24:32,150 --> 01:24:37,010
house and went out the sons of Jacob

1990
01:24:35,150 --> 01:24:40,280
came upon the slain and spoiled the city

1991
01:24:37,010 --> 01:24:41,690
because they had defiled their sister it

1992
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:43,219
took the sheep and the oxen and the

1993
01:24:41,690 --> 01:24:44,840
alysus and that which was in the city

1994
01:24:43,219 --> 01:24:46,610
and that was which it was in the field

1995
01:24:44,840 --> 01:24:48,710
and all their wealth and all their

1996
01:24:46,610 --> 01:24:50,869
little ones and their wives took they

1997
01:24:48,710 --> 01:24:53,420
came captive and spoiled everything else

1998
01:24:50,869 --> 01:24:54,829
that was in the house and Jacob actually

1999
01:24:53,420 --> 01:24:57,020
turns out not to be very happy about

2000
01:24:54,829 --> 01:24:59,929
that because he'd met with hammer and

2001
01:24:57,020 --> 01:25:02,270
they'd like hammered out a deal and that

2002
01:24:59,929 --> 01:25:04,730
and that's where they were living and so

2003
01:25:02,270 --> 01:25:07,550
he figured well that he was making the

2004
01:25:04,730 --> 01:25:11,510
best of a bad law let's say and his sons

2005
01:25:07,550 --> 01:25:13,550
went behind his back and Jacob says to

2006
01:25:11,510 --> 01:25:15,500
Simeon and Levi you have troubled me to

2007
01:25:13,550 --> 01:25:17,179
make me meat to make me stink among the

2008
01:25:15,500 --> 01:25:19,040
inhabitants of the land among the

2009
01:25:17,179 --> 01:25:21,170
Canaanites and the perizzites and I

2010
01:25:19,040 --> 01:25:23,239
being few in number they shall gather

2011
01:25:21,170 --> 01:25:25,699
themselves now together against me and

2012
01:25:23,239 --> 01:25:28,730
slay me and I shall be destroyed I had

2013
01:25:25,699 --> 01:25:33,920
my house and they said should he deal

2014
01:25:28,730 --> 01:25:35,900
with our sister as with a harlot and God

2015
01:25:33,920 --> 01:25:38,420
said unto Jacob and this is where we get

2016
01:25:35,900 --> 01:25:41,719
back to the idea of the center God says

2017
01:25:38,420 --> 01:25:43,670
to Jacob arise go to Bethel and dwell

2018
01:25:41,719 --> 01:25:46,250
there okay so Bethel was where Jacob had

2019
01:25:43,670 --> 01:25:48,980
originally put that pillar so now it's

2020
01:25:46,250 --> 01:25:50,989
back so he it's it's it's a real hero's

2021
01:25:48,980 --> 01:25:53,900
journey right there's there's the place

2022
01:25:50,989 --> 01:25:56,510
that he has a set place he goes out and

2023
01:25:53,900 --> 01:25:59,630
has these adventures and and undergoes a

2024
01:25:56,510 --> 01:26:01,670
moral transformation reconciles and then

2025
01:25:59,630 --> 01:26:01,849
he comes back to the same place right as

2026
01:26:01,670 --> 01:26:04,159
it

2027
01:26:01,849 --> 01:26:07,099
transformed person so that's a full hero

2028
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:09,559
cycle arise go to Bethel and dwell there

2029
01:26:07,099 --> 01:26:11,659
and make that there an altar unto God

2030
01:26:09,559 --> 01:26:13,659
that appeared to thee when thou fled us

2031
01:26:11,659 --> 01:26:16,039
from the face of Esau thy brother and

2032
01:26:13,659 --> 01:26:17,570
Jacob said to his household and to all

2033
01:26:16,039 --> 01:26:21,559
that were with him put away the strange

2034
01:26:17,570 --> 01:26:24,199
gods that are among you and be clean and

2035
01:26:21,559 --> 01:26:26,389
change your garments and let us arise

2036
01:26:24,199 --> 01:26:28,609
and go up to Bethel and I will make

2037
01:26:26,389 --> 01:26:30,469
there an altar unto God who answered me

2038
01:26:28,609 --> 01:26:34,219
in the day of my distress and was with

2039
01:26:30,469 --> 01:26:35,959
me in the way which I went and they gave

2040
01:26:34,219 --> 01:26:37,669
unto Jacob all the strange gods which

2041
01:26:35,959 --> 01:26:39,320
were in their hand and all their

2042
01:26:37,669 --> 01:26:41,359
earrings which were in their ears and

2043
01:26:39,320 --> 01:26:44,539
Jacob hid them under the oak which was

2044
01:26:41,359 --> 01:26:46,159
by Shechem and they journeyed and the

2045
01:26:44,539 --> 01:26:47,570
terror of God was upon the cities that

2046
01:26:46,159 --> 01:26:49,579
were round about them and they did not

2047
01:26:47,570 --> 01:26:51,889
pursue after the sons of Jacob

2048
01:26:49,579 --> 01:26:54,229
so Jacob came to laws which is in the

2049
01:26:51,889 --> 01:26:55,999
land of Canaan that is Bethel so that's

2050
01:26:54,229 --> 01:26:57,769
the place where he put up the pillar to

2051
01:26:55,999 --> 01:26:59,659
begin with he and all the people that

2052
01:26:57,769 --> 01:27:02,239
were there with him and he built there

2053
01:26:59,659 --> 01:27:04,219
an altar and called the place el Bethel

2054
01:27:02,239 --> 01:27:06,369
because their God appeared to him when

2055
01:27:04,219 --> 01:27:09,260
he fled from the face of his brother and

2056
01:27:06,369 --> 01:27:10,999
God appeared to Jacob again when he came

2057
01:27:09,260 --> 01:27:15,379
out of peda an aram and blessed him and

2058
01:27:10,999 --> 01:27:17,780
God said unto Him thy name is Jacob thy

2059
01:27:15,379 --> 01:27:19,579
name shall not be called any more Jacob

2060
01:27:17,780 --> 01:27:22,879
which you remember means usurper

2061
01:27:19,579 --> 01:27:26,300
but Israel shall be thy name he who

2062
01:27:22,879 --> 01:27:28,399
wrestles with God and he called his name

2063
01:27:26,300 --> 01:27:30,199
Israel and God said to him I am God

2064
01:27:28,399 --> 01:27:32,449
Almighty be fruitful and multiply a

2065
01:27:30,199 --> 01:27:34,579
nation and a company of nations shall be

2066
01:27:32,449 --> 01:27:36,949
of thee and Kings shall come out of thy

2067
01:27:34,579 --> 01:27:38,780
loins and the land which I gave Abraham

2068
01:27:36,949 --> 01:27:41,449
and Isaac to thee I will give it and to

2069
01:27:38,780 --> 01:27:44,209
thy seed after thee will I give the land

2070
01:27:41,449 --> 01:27:46,039
and God went up from him in the place

2071
01:27:44,209 --> 01:27:48,439
where he talked with him and God set up

2072
01:27:46,039 --> 01:27:50,479
Jacob set up a pillar in the place where

2073
01:27:48,439 --> 01:27:52,309
he talked with him a pillar of stone and

2074
01:27:50,479 --> 01:27:54,889
he poured a drink offering thereon and

2075
01:27:52,309 --> 01:27:56,269
he poured oil thereon and Jacob called

2076
01:27:54,889 --> 01:27:59,469
the name of the place where God spake

2077
01:27:56,269 --> 01:27:59,469
with him Bethel

2078
01:28:05,660 --> 01:28:11,760
so he's returned to the central place

2079
01:28:08,969 --> 01:28:16,469
which had been given to him as his

2080
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:20,040
territory Rachel dies in labor in the

2081
01:28:16,469 --> 01:28:22,230
process giving birth to an only son of

2082
01:28:20,040 --> 01:28:27,150
my sorrow whose name was then changed to

2083
01:28:22,230 --> 01:28:31,699
Benjamin son of the right hand now

2084
01:28:27,150 --> 01:28:33,960
Reuben so Simeon and Levi have already

2085
01:28:31,699 --> 01:28:36,420
done something unforgivable

2086
01:28:33,960 --> 01:28:39,239
now Reuben it's Reubens term he sleeps

2087
01:28:36,420 --> 01:28:40,050
with Bilhah who's Jacob Israel's

2088
01:28:39,239 --> 01:28:42,300
concubine

2089
01:28:40,050 --> 01:28:45,390
so he's the third of the sons to make an

2090
01:28:42,300 --> 01:28:47,840
unforgivable error and Jacob / Israel

2091
01:28:45,390 --> 01:28:50,489
gets wind of it so Reuben is no longer

2092
01:28:47,840 --> 01:28:53,370
he would have been the premier son given

2093
01:28:50,489 --> 01:28:55,890
that the two older sons were put out of

2094
01:28:53,370 --> 01:28:59,760
the running so to speak because of their

2095
01:28:55,890 --> 01:29:03,020
disobedience and impulsive vengeful

2096
01:28:59,760 --> 01:29:07,010
cruelty and then Reuben can't keep is

2097
01:29:03,020 --> 01:29:10,650
what do they say well you get the idea

2098
01:29:07,010 --> 01:29:15,870
yeah yeah seems to be something that's

2099
01:29:10,650 --> 01:29:19,469
still quite surprisingly common so then

2100
01:29:15,870 --> 01:29:21,510
we have this story that that basically

2101
01:29:19,469 --> 01:29:24,540
ends with this establishment of the

2102
01:29:21,510 --> 01:29:26,300
twelve tribes of Israel from Leah

2103
01:29:24,540 --> 01:29:29,610
there's Reuben Simeon Levi Judah

2104
01:29:26,300 --> 01:29:31,980
Issachar and Zebulun from Zilpah there's

2105
01:29:29,610 --> 01:29:34,260
gad and ashur from billah there's Dan

2106
01:29:31,980 --> 01:29:36,360
and Naphtali and from Rachel there's

2107
01:29:34,260 --> 01:29:38,880
Joseph who figures extraordinarily

2108
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:40,410
importantly in the next story that we're

2109
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:46,460
going to cover which hopefully will wrap

2110
01:29:40,410 --> 01:29:46,460
up Genesis and Benjamin and so now

2111
01:29:46,520 --> 01:29:56,070
Israel itself is established and so then

2112
01:29:53,400 --> 01:29:57,600
we turn to actually going to end this

2113
01:29:56,070 --> 01:30:03,150
early tonight that's quite bloody

2114
01:29:57,600 --> 01:30:08,340
miracle so the story then turns to

2115
01:30:03,150 --> 01:30:10,260
Joseph and the story begins essentially

2116
01:30:08,340 --> 01:30:11,760
now Israel loved Joseph more than all

2117
01:30:10,260 --> 01:30:14,160
his children because he was the son of

2118
01:30:11,760 --> 01:30:15,680
his old age and he made him a coat of

2119
01:30:14,160 --> 01:30:18,220
many colors

2120
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:21,350
and so what that seems to me to indicate

2121
01:30:18,220 --> 01:30:23,720
you know coats in dreams very often

2122
01:30:21,350 --> 01:30:25,190
seems to be particularly true of women's

2123
01:30:23,720 --> 01:30:27,920
dreams that's that's been like my

2124
01:30:25,190 --> 01:30:31,930
clinical observation clothing and

2125
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:34,310
footwear in particular symbolizes a role

2126
01:30:31,930 --> 01:30:36,020
and that makes sense right because you

2127
01:30:34,310 --> 01:30:38,540
address for the roles it's not that big

2128
01:30:36,020 --> 01:30:40,820
a mystery but so then you might say well

2129
01:30:38,540 --> 01:30:44,690
what does a coat of many colors indicate

2130
01:30:40,820 --> 01:30:47,210
and you know if you think of that

2131
01:30:44,690 --> 01:30:49,940
multiplicity there it's something like

2132
01:30:47,210 --> 01:30:52,430
the mastery of multiple domains right or

2133
01:30:49,940 --> 01:30:56,690
maybe something like plural potentiality

2134
01:30:52,430 --> 01:30:59,870
and so Jacob is is Israel's or Joseph is

2135
01:30:56,690 --> 01:31:03,080
Israel's favorite and because he sees in

2136
01:30:59,870 --> 01:31:05,080
him this excess possibility and he

2137
01:31:03,080 --> 01:31:08,660
basically tells his other sons that

2138
01:31:05,080 --> 01:31:10,490
Jacob is going to be the head son which

2139
01:31:08,660 --> 01:31:12,650
they are not happy with right because

2140
01:31:10,490 --> 01:31:14,480
he's just this young punk fundamentally

2141
01:31:12,650 --> 01:31:16,190
and he's clearly his father's favorite

2142
01:31:14,480 --> 01:31:19,060
and he gets this coat that's sort of

2143
01:31:16,190 --> 01:31:23,840
indicative of this higher status and so

2144
01:31:19,060 --> 01:31:26,210
Israel inadvertently sets up a

2145
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:30,700
tremendous amount of sibling rivalry in

2146
01:31:26,210 --> 01:31:35,510
the household again and that that's the

2147
01:31:30,700 --> 01:31:39,110
the understructure of the last story in

2148
01:31:35,510 --> 01:31:43,760
Genesis and so in in the last of this

2149
01:31:39,110 --> 01:31:46,730
lecture series for 2017 we'll cover the

2150
01:31:43,760 --> 01:31:48,740
story of Joseph and and his coat of many

2151
01:31:46,730 --> 01:31:52,220
colors and what happens as a consequence

2152
01:31:48,740 --> 01:31:56,480
of his of the favoritism shown to him by

2153
01:31:52,220 --> 01:31:59,810
his father and we'll track what happens

2154
01:31:56,480 --> 01:32:01,880
as a consequence of that and so I'm

2155
01:31:59,810 --> 01:32:04,570
going to stop there because I'm finished

2156
01:32:01,880 --> 01:32:04,570
so

2157
01:32:07,460 --> 01:32:12,150
hello dr. Pearson

2158
01:32:09,659 --> 01:32:17,090
this is an idea I've been wrestling with

2159
01:32:12,150 --> 01:32:19,350
for quite some time now this idea of a

2160
01:32:17,090 --> 01:32:21,989
lot of like the greatest sources of

2161
01:32:19,350 --> 01:32:24,960
wisdom that we've received through human

2162
01:32:21,989 --> 01:32:28,350
history either through texts experiences

2163
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:31,830
or scriptures seems to always come from

2164
01:32:28,350 --> 01:32:34,980
people going to isolation and then

2165
01:32:31,830 --> 01:32:37,320
coming back so I've had a hard time

2166
01:32:34,980 --> 01:32:39,480
trying to figure out from a scientific

2167
01:32:37,320 --> 01:32:43,639
point of view or evolutionary point of

2168
01:32:39,480 --> 01:32:46,380
view what would compel an organism to

2169
01:32:43,639 --> 01:32:48,350
that is that is centered around its

2170
01:32:46,380 --> 01:32:51,239
behave its behavior centered around

2171
01:32:48,350 --> 01:32:53,909
surviving in especially for humans as

2172
01:32:51,239 --> 01:32:57,480
social groups as well as reproducing to

2173
01:32:53,909 --> 01:33:00,600
want to go into isolation and then not

2174
01:32:57,480 --> 01:33:02,370
only that but obtain some level of

2175
01:33:00,600 --> 01:33:04,889
information that actually helps the

2176
01:33:02,370 --> 01:33:10,460
group in coming back that's a really

2177
01:33:04,889 --> 01:33:12,690
good question okay so there's this

2178
01:33:10,460 --> 01:33:16,050
neuroscientist neuropsychologist named

2179
01:33:12,690 --> 01:33:18,780
el Conan Goldberg and Goldberg was a

2180
01:33:16,050 --> 01:33:20,780
student of Alexander Luria and Alexander

2181
01:33:18,780 --> 01:33:23,429
Luria was a Russian neuropsychologist

2182
01:33:20,780 --> 01:33:26,420
perhaps the foremost neuropsychologist

2183
01:33:23,429 --> 01:33:29,909
of the mid to late 20th century and he

2184
01:33:26,420 --> 01:33:33,179
had students Sokolov in vineger dov'è

2185
01:33:29,909 --> 01:33:34,770
who discovered the orienting reflex for

2186
01:33:33,179 --> 01:33:36,510
example the orienting reflexes the

2187
01:33:34,770 --> 01:33:38,610
reflex that Orient's you when something

2188
01:33:36,510 --> 01:33:40,860
anomalous interferes with your goal

2189
01:33:38,610 --> 01:33:44,070
directed behavior it's a major discovery

2190
01:33:40,860 --> 01:33:45,690
like one of the one of the four or five

2191
01:33:44,070 --> 01:33:48,780
most important discoveries that have

2192
01:33:45,690 --> 01:33:50,580
ever been made in in in psychology I

2193
01:33:48,780 --> 01:33:53,940
would say certainly in neuroscience so

2194
01:33:50,580 --> 01:33:55,560
Luria was a big deal and he was the

2195
01:33:53,940 --> 01:33:56,820
first person who really established the

2196
01:33:55,560 --> 01:34:02,280
functional role of the prefrontal cortex

2197
01:33:56,820 --> 01:34:04,290
as well so and had it very nice overall

2198
01:34:02,280 --> 01:34:06,030
view of how the brain function his book

2199
01:34:04,290 --> 01:34:08,130
was written in 1980 and it's still

2200
01:34:06,030 --> 01:34:10,080
there's still loss in it that's really

2201
01:34:08,130 --> 01:34:11,760
useful which is pretty strange for a

2202
01:34:10,080 --> 01:34:15,570
science that's advanced that quickly

2203
01:34:11,760 --> 01:34:19,500
anyways so Goldberg came from a great

2204
01:34:15,570 --> 01:34:20,370
pedigree I believe Maria's teacher was

2205
01:34:19,500 --> 01:34:25,520
have

2206
01:34:20,370 --> 01:34:25,520
if I remember correctly so anyways

2207
01:34:28,700 --> 01:34:35,070
Goldberg you know you hear some of you

2208
01:34:32,670 --> 01:34:38,790
may have heard the idea that the left

2209
01:34:35,070 --> 01:34:40,290
hemisphere is more or linguistic than

2210
01:34:38,790 --> 01:34:41,910
the right hemisphere is that left

2211
01:34:40,290 --> 01:34:43,860
hemisphere is specialized for language

2212
01:34:41,910 --> 01:34:47,370
and the right hemisphere is specialized

2213
01:34:43,860 --> 01:34:51,180
for nonverbal imagistic communication

2214
01:34:47,370 --> 01:34:52,920
the left hemisphere has a pretty well

2215
01:34:51,180 --> 01:34:57,170
organized microstructure and the right

2216
01:34:52,920 --> 01:34:59,700
hemisphere is more diffuse as well and

2217
01:34:57,170 --> 01:35:01,500
that's true in left-handed males in

2218
01:34:59,700 --> 01:35:03,840
particular so the circuitry can be

2219
01:35:01,500 --> 01:35:05,790
switched around a bit but it's okay the

2220
01:35:03,840 --> 01:35:07,890
modules are basically the same although

2221
01:35:05,790 --> 01:35:09,870
they can be moved a little bit but

2222
01:35:07,890 --> 01:35:13,440
Goldberg thought that it isn't language

2223
01:35:09,870 --> 01:35:16,320
versus non language it's routine versus

2224
01:35:13,440 --> 01:35:19,590
novelty and so the left hemisphere and

2225
01:35:16,320 --> 01:35:21,510
there's a neuropsychologist physician

2226
01:35:19,590 --> 01:35:25,650
named Ramachandran who's done some very

2227
01:35:21,510 --> 01:35:26,940
interesting work that's pertinent to

2228
01:35:25,650 --> 01:35:30,510
this maybe I'll tell you a story about

2229
01:35:26,940 --> 01:35:35,130
him anyways Goldberg believed that the

2230
01:35:30,510 --> 01:35:38,070
right hemisphere say you have very old

2231
01:35:35,130 --> 01:35:40,410
systems underneath both both cortical

2232
01:35:38,070 --> 01:35:42,600
hemispheres that do things like respond

2233
01:35:40,410 --> 01:35:45,900
to anomaly to the thing that doesn't fit

2234
01:35:42,600 --> 01:35:47,610
to the predator in the distance some of

2235
01:35:45,900 --> 01:35:49,320
that's extraordinarily fast so that

2236
01:35:47,610 --> 01:35:51,630
would be like a snake reflex that can

2237
01:35:49,320 --> 01:35:53,370
move you away from a snake in less time

2238
01:35:51,630 --> 01:35:54,960
than it takes the snake to bite and it's

2239
01:35:53,370 --> 01:35:57,690
really a reflex it doesn't even hit your

2240
01:35:54,960 --> 01:36:00,570
brain it's really super fast and then

2241
01:35:57,690 --> 01:36:02,820
there's a defensive Crouch that's that's

2242
01:36:00,570 --> 01:36:04,830
instantiated higher up in the nervous

2243
01:36:02,820 --> 01:36:06,870
system but that's still remarkably fast

2244
01:36:04,830 --> 01:36:09,750
and then there's fear as an emotion and

2245
01:36:06,870 --> 01:36:11,700
and the orientation of attention and

2246
01:36:09,750 --> 01:36:13,890
then there's the cognitive processing

2247
01:36:11,700 --> 01:36:15,750
and that all streams out across a time

2248
01:36:13,890 --> 01:36:17,970
span right and maybe that time span is

2249
01:36:15,750 --> 01:36:19,740
half a second so you and that's really a

2250
01:36:17,970 --> 01:36:22,560
long time if something is attacking you

2251
01:36:19,740 --> 01:36:23,790
so you got those initial responses are

2252
01:36:22,560 --> 01:36:26,400
quite primitive but they're

2253
01:36:23,790 --> 01:36:28,530
extraordinarily fast all right so

2254
01:36:26,400 --> 01:36:31,050
there's subcortical structures that

2255
01:36:28,530 --> 01:36:34,690
orient you towards novelty and prepare

2256
01:36:31,050 --> 01:36:36,700
you for for freezing or for it

2257
01:36:34,690 --> 01:36:39,460
and the right hemisphere seems to be

2258
01:36:36,700 --> 01:36:42,490
dominated by those systems so imagine

2259
01:36:39,460 --> 01:36:44,620
that what happens is that something

2260
01:36:42,490 --> 01:36:46,270
threatens you you orient towards it

2261
01:36:44,620 --> 01:36:47,890
the right hemisphere produces a bunch of

2262
01:36:46,270 --> 01:36:49,660
images about what it might be

2263
01:36:47,890 --> 01:36:51,220
so imagine that's what happens when a

2264
01:36:49,660 --> 01:36:53,260
child is afraid of the dark

2265
01:36:51,220 --> 01:36:54,760
the child's on the bed they're afraid of

2266
01:36:53,260 --> 01:36:56,380
the dark they're crouched because

2267
01:36:54,760 --> 01:36:58,300
they're frozen like a prey animal and

2268
01:36:56,380 --> 01:37:01,570
their right hemisphere is producing

2269
01:36:58,300 --> 01:37:04,090
monsters to inhabit the the darkness

2270
01:37:01,570 --> 01:37:07,900
that are the child's hypotheses about

2271
01:37:04,090 --> 01:37:10,180
what might be out there okay because

2272
01:37:07,900 --> 01:37:11,470
that's what you want to know right you

2273
01:37:10,180 --> 01:37:13,900
want to know what's out there and then

2274
01:37:11,470 --> 01:37:16,270
you want to know what to do about it I

2275
01:37:13,900 --> 01:37:19,420
can tell you two kids dreams that are

2276
01:37:16,270 --> 01:37:22,650
sort of relevant to that so when my

2277
01:37:19,420 --> 01:37:25,240
daughter was about three she came into

2278
01:37:22,650 --> 01:37:27,940
the bedroom that my wife and I had and

2279
01:37:25,240 --> 01:37:32,020
she was crying she'd had a nightmare and

2280
01:37:27,940 --> 01:37:34,600
she said that she saw a stream and there

2281
01:37:32,020 --> 01:37:36,490
was garbage all over the stream and she

2282
01:37:34,600 --> 01:37:39,610
didn't like that and so I sat her down I

2283
01:37:36,490 --> 01:37:40,960
said okay so imagine the stream with the

2284
01:37:39,610 --> 01:37:42,370
garbage in it now imagine that you're

2285
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:45,670
taking the garbage out and throwing it

2286
01:37:42,370 --> 01:37:47,620
in the garbage bin and so she and I got

2287
01:37:45,670 --> 01:37:49,270
her to like visualize that because that

2288
01:37:47,620 --> 01:37:51,340
kind of puts her back in the semi dream

2289
01:37:49,270 --> 01:37:53,350
state and then she cleaned up the mess

2290
01:37:51,340 --> 01:37:55,030
and then she could go off to sleep now

2291
01:37:53,350 --> 01:37:56,500
you you could tell the child don't worry

2292
01:37:55,030 --> 01:37:58,690
about the dream isn't real

2293
01:37:56,500 --> 01:38:01,570
that's not that's true because it's not

2294
01:37:58,690 --> 01:38:04,210
real like other daytime things are but

2295
01:38:01,570 --> 01:38:06,700
it's not like it's not real it's a dream

2296
01:38:04,210 --> 01:38:10,360
like a dream is real it's just not the

2297
01:38:06,700 --> 01:38:13,210
same kind of real and so what I did with

2298
01:38:10,360 --> 01:38:15,790
her was to indicate to her practically

2299
01:38:13,210 --> 01:38:17,500
that if she saw something a normal uh

2300
01:38:15,790 --> 01:38:19,900
something that was out of place right

2301
01:38:17,500 --> 01:38:23,650
something that was a mess that it was

2302
01:38:19,900 --> 01:38:26,440
within her capacity to set it right okay

2303
01:38:23,650 --> 01:38:28,900
and so okay so now your right hemisphere

2304
01:38:26,440 --> 01:38:32,650
tells you what monsters might inhabit

2305
01:38:28,900 --> 01:38:34,210
the the darkness now what you have to do

2306
01:38:32,650 --> 01:38:36,910
is figure out there's two things you

2307
01:38:34,210 --> 01:38:40,330
have to figure out one is what to do

2308
01:38:36,910 --> 01:38:42,370
about a given monster and now there is

2309
01:38:40,330 --> 01:38:44,380
to do what about is to figure out what

2310
01:38:42,370 --> 01:38:47,980
to do about the class of all possible

2311
01:38:44,380 --> 01:38:48,450
monsters right that's a whole different

2312
01:38:47,980 --> 01:38:49,680
thing that's

2313
01:38:48,450 --> 01:38:51,770
something that only human beings are

2314
01:38:49,680 --> 01:38:54,360
capable of that level of abstraction

2315
01:38:51,770 --> 01:38:57,150
right and so what you might do about a

2316
01:38:54,360 --> 01:39:00,090
particular monster is hide or go out and

2317
01:38:57,150 --> 01:39:02,250
get rid of it if it was just an actual

2318
01:39:00,090 --> 01:39:03,750
animal right but that doesn't help

2319
01:39:02,250 --> 01:39:06,000
because there's all the other potential

2320
01:39:03,750 --> 01:39:08,100
predators that are still there and so

2321
01:39:06,000 --> 01:39:09,210
maybe you can go hunt all them down but

2322
01:39:08,100 --> 01:39:11,730
that doesn't help either because you

2323
01:39:09,210 --> 01:39:13,950
can't hunt them all down it's not or

2324
01:39:11,730 --> 01:39:15,510
it's not very likely anyways so instead

2325
01:39:13,950 --> 01:39:17,160
what you have to do is figure out how to

2326
01:39:15,510 --> 01:39:19,320
configure yourself so that you're in the

2327
01:39:17,160 --> 01:39:21,480
best possible position to fight off the

2328
01:39:19,320 --> 01:39:21,870
monsters when they come that's your best

2329
01:39:21,480 --> 01:39:24,210
bet

2330
01:39:21,870 --> 01:39:26,430
all right so now people are trying to

2331
01:39:24,210 --> 01:39:28,350
figure this out forever they're trying

2332
01:39:26,430 --> 01:39:31,410
to figure out what's the answer to the

2333
01:39:28,350 --> 01:39:33,780
problem of the class of all possible

2334
01:39:31,410 --> 01:39:38,400
monsters part of that sacrifice

2335
01:39:33,780 --> 01:39:41,160
so there are routines for example in in

2336
01:39:38,400 --> 01:39:43,290
Hinduism with the goddess Kali you make

2337
01:39:41,160 --> 01:39:45,570
offerings to Kelly who's this devouring

2338
01:39:43,290 --> 01:39:48,240
goddess and then she turns into her

2339
01:39:45,570 --> 01:39:50,220
benevolent counterpart and so sacrifice

2340
01:39:48,240 --> 01:39:52,770
is actually one way that you can tame

2341
01:39:50,220 --> 01:39:55,350
the monsters if you think about the

2342
01:39:52,770 --> 01:39:57,570
monster has the set of all negative

2343
01:39:55,350 --> 01:39:59,340
future potentialities you make the

2344
01:39:57,570 --> 01:40:01,800
proper sacrifice as those monsters stay

2345
01:39:59,340 --> 01:40:05,310
at bay but then there's heroism as an

2346
01:40:01,800 --> 01:40:07,410
alternative to which which means the act

2347
01:40:05,310 --> 01:40:09,120
of confrontation of the class of all

2348
01:40:07,410 --> 01:40:10,410
possible monsters and the building of

2349
01:40:09,120 --> 01:40:12,540
yourself up and into this sort of

2350
01:40:10,410 --> 01:40:15,140
courageous person that can do that it

2351
01:40:12,540 --> 01:40:19,410
took a tremendous amount of meditation

2352
01:40:15,140 --> 01:40:25,110
to transform those images say of the

2353
01:40:19,410 --> 01:40:27,510
monsters in into it or to solve the

2354
01:40:25,110 --> 01:40:29,070
problem of the class of those monsters

2355
01:40:27,510 --> 01:40:31,410
so now I'll tell you another child

2356
01:40:29,070 --> 01:40:33,270
stream so some of you have probably

2357
01:40:31,410 --> 01:40:37,460
heard this before but it's such a great

2358
01:40:33,270 --> 01:40:37,460
dream that it's worth it's worth telling

2359
01:40:37,970 --> 01:40:43,980
so now is that my sister-in-law's house

2360
01:40:41,370 --> 01:40:46,680
once and her son was running around he's

2361
01:40:43,980 --> 01:40:49,770
about four very precocious very verbal

2362
01:40:46,680 --> 01:40:51,320
very intelligent running around with a

2363
01:40:49,770 --> 01:40:54,000
knight hat on and a sword

2364
01:40:51,320 --> 01:40:56,550
so he's engaged in this pretty intense

2365
01:40:54,000 --> 01:40:58,650
play world and when he goes to sleep he

2366
01:40:56,550 --> 01:41:00,690
puts the knight hat on his pillow and

2367
01:40:58,650 --> 01:41:01,860
the sword by his pillow and at the same

2368
01:41:00,690 --> 01:41:04,260
time he

2369
01:41:01,860 --> 01:41:06,210
having night terrors so he's waking up

2370
01:41:04,260 --> 01:41:09,719
and had been for a number of weeks

2371
01:41:06,210 --> 01:41:12,810
Nate waking up screaming and then but he

2372
01:41:09,719 --> 01:41:14,100
doesn't know why there's some things

2373
01:41:12,810 --> 01:41:15,869
that aren't going so well in the

2374
01:41:14,100 --> 01:41:18,449
household and the parents get divorced

2375
01:41:15,869 --> 01:41:20,400
shortly afterwards okay so that's oh

2376
01:41:18,449 --> 01:41:23,070
that's that's what's going on underneath

2377
01:41:20,400 --> 01:41:24,690
right and he's also gonna go to

2378
01:41:23,070 --> 01:41:26,940
kindergarten and so he's about to go

2379
01:41:24,690 --> 01:41:31,800
into the world and so he's coping with

2380
01:41:26,940 --> 01:41:33,389
this you know so I'm watching him zoom

2381
01:41:31,800 --> 01:41:37,469
around as this night and thinking that's

2382
01:41:33,389 --> 01:41:40,139
pretty cool and that night he woke up

2383
01:41:37,469 --> 01:41:42,869
and had a it was screaming and so we're

2384
01:41:40,139 --> 01:41:46,050
all at breakfast the next morning and I

2385
01:41:42,869 --> 01:41:49,139
said did you dream anything and he got

2386
01:41:46,050 --> 01:41:51,690
really intense and he said yes I had a

2387
01:41:49,139 --> 01:41:54,690
dream and I said well what was the dream

2388
01:41:51,690 --> 01:41:59,369
and he said well I was out on this field

2389
01:41:54,690 --> 01:42:00,780
and all these like dwarfs came up to me

2390
01:41:59,369 --> 01:42:03,780
they were only about as high as my knees

2391
01:42:00,780 --> 01:42:06,570
and they didn't have any arms they have

2392
01:42:03,780 --> 01:42:09,600
powerful legs and they were covered with

2393
01:42:06,570 --> 01:42:11,280
like hairy feathers and grease and there

2394
01:42:09,600 --> 01:42:15,480
was cross carved in the top of their

2395
01:42:11,280 --> 01:42:16,830
head and they had beaks and whenever he

2396
01:42:15,480 --> 01:42:18,989
moved anywhere they would jump at him

2397
01:42:16,830 --> 01:42:21,630
with his with their beaks and there were

2398
01:42:18,989 --> 01:42:24,830
lots of them and everyone like just said

2399
01:42:21,630 --> 01:42:27,869
nothing at breakfast it was like yeah

2400
01:42:24,830 --> 01:42:30,389
cuz and he was right into this story and

2401
01:42:27,869 --> 01:42:31,650
so we were all like yeah well huh there

2402
01:42:30,389 --> 01:42:36,210
are that accounts for all the screaming

2403
01:42:31,650 --> 01:42:38,630
and so and then he said yeah and then in

2404
01:42:36,210 --> 01:42:42,150
the background there was a dragon and

2405
01:42:38,630 --> 01:42:45,869
every time the dragon puffed out smoke

2406
01:42:42,150 --> 01:42:47,610
it would turn into these dwarves it's

2407
01:42:45,869 --> 01:42:50,310
like oh man kid you really got a problem

2408
01:42:47,610 --> 01:42:53,010
there you got you got beat things that

2409
01:42:50,310 --> 01:42:55,920
are biting you and you can kill them and

2410
01:42:53,010 --> 01:42:57,840
that's fine but then there's the dragon

2411
01:42:55,920 --> 01:43:00,060
just puffing out new ones so it's like a

2412
01:42:57,840 --> 01:43:01,650
Hydra problem right the old Hydra is the

2413
01:43:00,060 --> 01:43:04,409
serpent you cut off one had seven more

2414
01:43:01,650 --> 01:43:07,260
grow it's not a good thing and it's such

2415
01:43:04,409 --> 01:43:09,659
a cool dream because it really portrayed

2416
01:43:07,260 --> 01:43:11,880
this class of all possible monsters

2417
01:43:09,659 --> 01:43:14,040
problem so you've got the specific

2418
01:43:11,880 --> 01:43:15,390
monsters and that's a problem so you got

2419
01:43:14,040 --> 01:43:16,740
to get rid of them but that's

2420
01:43:15,390 --> 01:43:18,390
not the problem the problem is is that

2421
01:43:16,740 --> 01:43:19,860
there's a there's something in the

2422
01:43:18,390 --> 01:43:23,000
background that's just generating

2423
01:43:19,860 --> 01:43:25,290
monsters like mad and so I said to him

2424
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:27,990
what do you think you could do about

2425
01:43:25,290 --> 01:43:29,670
that and that's a that's a loaded

2426
01:43:27,990 --> 01:43:31,560
question right that's like leading the

2427
01:43:29,670 --> 01:43:33,630
witness in the trial you don't get to

2428
01:43:31,560 --> 01:43:36,870
ask a question like that because it

2429
01:43:33,630 --> 01:43:38,190
implies that it implies the answer what

2430
01:43:36,870 --> 01:43:40,410
could you do about that

2431
01:43:38,190 --> 01:43:43,350
is not any different than saying you

2432
01:43:40,410 --> 01:43:47,340
could do something about that right so

2433
01:43:43,350 --> 01:43:48,660
so I hinted at that as a possibility and

2434
01:43:47,340 --> 01:43:50,130
his eyes lit up

2435
01:43:48,660 --> 01:43:52,380
now you remember he's already running

2436
01:43:50,130 --> 01:43:54,180
around as at night Hey so he kind of

2437
01:43:52,380 --> 01:43:56,580
already knew what to do because he had

2438
01:43:54,180 --> 01:43:58,380
the whole sword in the Hat and with that

2439
01:43:56,580 --> 01:44:01,440
you know that you can go after the drag

2440
01:43:58,380 --> 01:44:05,280
and he kind of got that and he said I'd

2441
01:44:01,440 --> 01:44:07,350
get my dad and then I jump up on top of

2442
01:44:05,280 --> 01:44:09,450
the dragon and I'd poke out both of its

2443
01:44:07,350 --> 01:44:12,060
eyes with my sword and then he'd go

2444
01:44:09,450 --> 01:44:14,190
right down its throat to the fire box

2445
01:44:12,060 --> 01:44:16,230
where the fire comes out and I carve out

2446
01:44:14,190 --> 01:44:21,470
a piece of the fire box and then I'd

2447
01:44:16,230 --> 01:44:21,470
used that as a shield and I thought yes

2448
01:44:21,530 --> 01:44:29,130
right right man it's so smart eh because

2449
01:44:26,940 --> 01:44:31,530
he got the thing instantly he knew that

2450
01:44:29,130 --> 01:44:32,850
he knew so imagine first of all he

2451
01:44:31,530 --> 01:44:35,160
thought okay I have to go to the heart

2452
01:44:32,850 --> 01:44:37,440
of the problem right and really to the

2453
01:44:35,160 --> 01:44:40,050
heart not to the dragon but right down

2454
01:44:37,440 --> 01:44:42,900
the dam thanks gullet right to the place

2455
01:44:40,050 --> 01:44:44,970
where the fire was actually being it was

2456
01:44:42,900 --> 01:44:46,800
actually being created because there it

2457
01:44:44,970 --> 01:44:48,420
was there you could find the shield and

2458
01:44:46,800 --> 01:44:50,220
that he'd take this thing that was

2459
01:44:48,420 --> 01:44:51,540
fireproof and make a shield out of it

2460
01:44:50,220 --> 01:44:54,870
and so that was just

2461
01:44:51,540 --> 01:44:56,460
he had bloody perfect it was so cool and

2462
01:44:54,870 --> 01:44:58,650
you think well how could a kid come up

2463
01:44:56,460 --> 01:45:00,810
with that and there's a bunch of answers

2464
01:44:58,650 --> 01:45:02,310
I mean one is we know snake fear is

2465
01:45:00,810 --> 01:45:05,070
innate we know that now there's been

2466
01:45:02,310 --> 01:45:07,620
recent research data that that has

2467
01:45:05,070 --> 01:45:09,720
demonstrated that okay so and we've been

2468
01:45:07,620 --> 01:45:12,750
preyed on and been predators for a very

2469
01:45:09,720 --> 01:45:14,670
long period of time so the idea that and

2470
01:45:12,750 --> 01:45:16,800
I found something else interesting about

2471
01:45:14,670 --> 01:45:18,570
the brain out that dubrow out about the

2472
01:45:16,800 --> 01:45:20,970
brain recently - and book I was reading

2473
01:45:18,570 --> 01:45:22,230
by Ray Kurzweil called how to build a

2474
01:45:20,970 --> 01:45:25,590
mind I think that's what it was called

2475
01:45:22,230 --> 01:45:27,000
it was quite a good book so I think it

2476
01:45:25,590 --> 01:45:28,680
was in that book or it was in the

2477
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:29,099
neuroscience paper I was reading doesn't

2478
01:45:28,680 --> 01:45:31,229
matter

2479
01:45:29,099 --> 01:45:33,929
but it was in one of those two places so

2480
01:45:31,229 --> 01:45:35,609
you know that scanning technology has

2481
01:45:33,929 --> 01:45:37,109
got more and more high resolution over

2482
01:45:35,609 --> 01:45:38,489
the last few years right it just gets

2483
01:45:37,109 --> 01:45:40,889
more and more high-resolution all the

2484
01:45:38,489 --> 01:45:42,929
time and so people are now able to look

2485
01:45:40,889 --> 01:45:44,849
at the micro structures of the brain in

2486
01:45:42,929 --> 01:45:47,189
a way that hasn't been possible before

2487
01:45:44,849 --> 01:45:49,349
and so the old idea with the cortex

2488
01:45:47,189 --> 01:45:51,809
basically was that cortex was full of a

2489
01:45:49,349 --> 01:45:53,669
bunch of neurons and then when one

2490
01:45:51,809 --> 01:45:55,709
neuron and another fired at the same

2491
01:45:53,669 --> 01:45:57,539
time they would wire together and that's

2492
01:45:55,709 --> 01:45:59,909
kind of how your brain learned to make

2493
01:45:57,539 --> 01:46:01,709
connections it's a bit more complicated

2494
01:45:59,909 --> 01:46:03,169
than that but that will do and then it

2495
01:46:01,709 --> 01:46:06,929
was found that it wasn't quite that

2496
01:46:03,169 --> 01:46:09,300
simple because what your cortex is made

2497
01:46:06,929 --> 01:46:11,579
out of are these columns of neurons that

2498
01:46:09,300 --> 01:46:14,789
are duplicated sort of like a like

2499
01:46:11,579 --> 01:46:16,769
centipedes legs you know it's very

2500
01:46:14,789 --> 01:46:18,989
simple genetic code to add another leg

2501
01:46:16,769 --> 01:46:20,369
set of legs to a centipede it's sort of

2502
01:46:18,989 --> 01:46:22,439
like that with your brain it's made out

2503
01:46:20,369 --> 01:46:25,169
of all these columns and the columns are

2504
01:46:22,439 --> 01:46:27,449
basically already quite wired up and

2505
01:46:25,169 --> 01:46:28,050
then as you learn the columns wired

2506
01:46:27,449 --> 01:46:30,269
together

2507
01:46:28,050 --> 01:46:31,499
okay so there's some pre-existence

2508
01:46:30,269 --> 01:46:33,449
structure there but there's more

2509
01:46:31,499 --> 01:46:36,840
preexisting structure than what that was

2510
01:46:33,449 --> 01:46:39,590
thought so it's it's basically that

2511
01:46:36,840 --> 01:46:42,119
there are already tracts that link

2512
01:46:39,590 --> 01:46:44,879
columns together that are in different

2513
01:46:42,119 --> 01:46:46,849
parts of the brain and the columns can

2514
01:46:44,879 --> 01:46:50,879
or the columns themselves can send out

2515
01:46:46,849 --> 01:46:51,869
dendrites to these superhighways which

2516
01:46:50,879 --> 01:46:53,699
are already there and then the

2517
01:46:51,869 --> 01:46:56,519
superhighway is there and then it can

2518
01:46:53,699 --> 01:46:58,619
generate connections to the columns at

2519
01:46:56,519 --> 01:47:00,419
the end of the superhighway so what that

2520
01:46:58,619 --> 01:47:02,189
means is that there's a tremendous

2521
01:47:00,419 --> 01:47:04,349
amount of cortical structure already in

2522
01:47:02,189 --> 01:47:05,579
place but there's plasticity around that

2523
01:47:04,349 --> 01:47:06,629
and when I read that I thought well

2524
01:47:05,579 --> 01:47:08,219
that's part of the source of the

2525
01:47:06,629 --> 01:47:10,109
archetypes there's already an archetypal

2526
01:47:08,219 --> 01:47:12,689
structure there that as well as the

2527
01:47:10,109 --> 01:47:15,469
subcortical structures so you could say

2528
01:47:12,689 --> 01:47:19,349
that like the kid already had within him

2529
01:47:15,469 --> 01:47:21,419
not only the capacity to represent not

2530
01:47:19,349 --> 01:47:23,550
only the monster but the class of all

2531
01:47:21,419 --> 01:47:25,590
possible monsters and the fact that the

2532
01:47:23,550 --> 01:47:27,239
problem wasn't monsters the problem was

2533
01:47:25,590 --> 01:47:29,609
that monsters could continually be

2534
01:47:27,239 --> 01:47:31,469
generated which is a way worse problem

2535
01:47:29,609 --> 01:47:33,599
and then the answer to that isn't to

2536
01:47:31,469 --> 01:47:35,159
kill an individual monster the answer to

2537
01:47:33,599 --> 01:47:38,579
that is go to the source of the

2538
01:47:35,159 --> 01:47:40,379
monstrous itself and defeat it so it's

2539
01:47:38,579 --> 01:47:41,459
absolutely staggering and you could

2540
01:47:40,379 --> 01:47:42,929
imagine that it would take a tremendous

2541
01:47:41,459 --> 01:47:45,119
amount of meditate

2542
01:47:42,929 --> 01:47:46,739
of effort for people to have come up

2543
01:47:45,119 --> 01:47:51,510
with that solution over a very long

2544
01:47:46,739 --> 01:47:54,599
period of time so now the point of the

2545
01:47:51,510 --> 01:47:57,269
representation is to formulate a picture

2546
01:47:54,599 --> 01:47:59,820
of what it is that's the threat so that

2547
01:47:57,269 --> 01:48:03,059
you can then formulate a general purpose

2548
01:47:59,820 --> 01:48:05,459
solution and so there's this image of

2549
01:48:03,059 --> 01:48:07,349
Kali which I really like because Kelly

2550
01:48:05,459 --> 01:48:10,249
is sort of the goddess of the darkness

2551
01:48:07,349 --> 01:48:13,860
let's say in destruction and so Kelly is

2552
01:48:10,249 --> 01:48:15,119
she has a headdress of fire her hair is

2553
01:48:13,860 --> 01:48:17,519
on fire and she has a headdress of

2554
01:48:15,119 --> 01:48:19,409
skulls and she has hands cut off all

2555
01:48:17,519 --> 01:48:21,590
around her neck and she has a belt

2556
01:48:19,409 --> 01:48:24,420
that's often snakes but it's sometimes

2557
01:48:21,590 --> 01:48:26,309
she sometimes eating the intestines of

2558
01:48:24,420 --> 01:48:28,170
this guy that she's just given birth to

2559
01:48:26,309 --> 01:48:30,479
and that she's sitting on she has eight

2560
01:48:28,170 --> 01:48:33,119
legs like a spider and she's in a web of

2561
01:48:30,479 --> 01:48:35,939
fire and so she's a monster in some

2562
01:48:33,119 --> 01:48:38,610
sense that represents everything that

2563
01:48:35,939 --> 01:48:40,459
might terrify and devour you and the

2564
01:48:38,610 --> 01:48:42,539
question is so you come up with that

2565
01:48:40,459 --> 01:48:45,059
representation as an image to represent

2566
01:48:42,539 --> 01:48:47,159
the class of all terrifying things and

2567
01:48:45,059 --> 01:48:49,949
then you have to generate a solution in

2568
01:48:47,159 --> 01:48:51,989
the face of that class and sacrifice is

2569
01:48:49,949 --> 01:48:54,209
one of the solutions but that heroic

2570
01:48:51,989 --> 01:48:56,090
encounter is another one of the

2571
01:48:54,209 --> 01:48:58,679
solutions and that's the one that he

2572
01:48:56,090 --> 01:49:00,689
catalyzed now he'd been read lots of

2573
01:48:58,679 --> 01:49:04,050
books he'd watched lots of Disney movies

2574
01:49:00,689 --> 01:49:06,659
you know and and he'd seen the heroic

2575
01:49:04,050 --> 01:49:09,659
pattern portrayed many many places and

2576
01:49:06,659 --> 01:49:12,239
his little brain was working like mad to

2577
01:49:09,659 --> 01:49:14,099
extract out the essence of that and to

2578
01:49:12,239 --> 01:49:17,219
embody it and when I asked him that

2579
01:49:14,099 --> 01:49:19,380
question it just went snap and all those

2580
01:49:17,219 --> 01:49:22,260
things lined up and his night terrors

2581
01:49:19,380 --> 01:49:23,909
went away that was it and I followed up

2582
01:49:22,260 --> 01:49:26,070
with his mom because it was really quite

2583
01:49:23,909 --> 01:49:27,900
remarkable the whole set of occurrences

2584
01:49:26,070 --> 01:49:29,340
you know and he didn't have night

2585
01:49:27,900 --> 01:49:30,989
terrors that night even though he'd been

2586
01:49:29,340 --> 01:49:32,969
having the nightly and that was the end

2587
01:49:30,989 --> 01:49:35,760
of them because he'd solved his problem

2588
01:49:32,969 --> 01:49:38,789
like he needed to be the courageous

2589
01:49:35,760 --> 01:49:42,360
knight that went after the dragon and so

2590
01:49:38,789 --> 01:49:47,489
that is what people need to be so I

2591
01:49:42,360 --> 01:49:50,309
think when we go into solitude we shut

2592
01:49:47,489 --> 01:49:53,219
off the external stimulation and we let

2593
01:49:50,309 --> 01:49:56,610
the Dreaming part of our mind emerge and

2594
01:49:53,219 --> 01:50:00,139
that's this nonverbal pattern

2595
01:49:56,610 --> 01:50:02,820
detector that thinks in images and it's

2596
01:50:00,139 --> 01:50:04,679
it's the thing that mediates between

2597
01:50:02,820 --> 01:50:06,360
what we don't understand and what we do

2598
01:50:04,679 --> 01:50:07,889
understand like if you understand it

2599
01:50:06,360 --> 01:50:10,080
completely you can say it and you can

2600
01:50:07,889 --> 01:50:11,850
act it out if you don't understand it

2601
01:50:10,080 --> 01:50:15,320
you represent it in images and there

2602
01:50:11,850 --> 01:50:17,940
it's like it's the emotion fear

2603
01:50:15,320 --> 01:50:19,889
withdrawal paralysis and then that

2604
01:50:17,940 --> 01:50:22,679
manifests itself in an image of what

2605
01:50:19,889 --> 01:50:24,900
that might be and that image is the

2606
01:50:22,679 --> 01:50:27,080
basis for the story and it's the basis

2607
01:50:24,900 --> 01:50:29,880
for further development of the idea and

2608
01:50:27,080 --> 01:50:32,010
to go into isolation is to let those

2609
01:50:29,880 --> 01:50:35,010
images emerge and to dream a little bit

2610
01:50:32,010 --> 01:50:39,030
and then that moves you that moves you

2611
01:50:35,010 --> 01:50:42,300
ahead into the future so language they

2612
01:50:39,030 --> 01:50:45,000
use before it's enough just to map out

2613
01:50:42,300 --> 01:50:46,949
the danger that is imminent in front of

2614
01:50:45,000 --> 01:50:48,980
you but all the potential dangers that

2615
01:50:46,949 --> 01:50:53,460
you could come up with in abstract form

2616
01:50:48,980 --> 01:50:55,800
yeah well remember what happens when God

2617
01:50:53,460 --> 01:50:58,619
throws Adam and Eve out of out of

2618
01:50:55,800 --> 01:51:01,170
paradise they become aware that they're

2619
01:50:58,619 --> 01:51:03,480
going to die right the future becomes a

2620
01:51:01,170 --> 01:51:05,659
problem because you could say the future

2621
01:51:03,480 --> 01:51:08,040
is the place of all potential monsters

2622
01:51:05,659 --> 01:51:09,270
right and so just the monster that you

2623
01:51:08,040 --> 01:51:10,739
have right in front of you it's like

2624
01:51:09,270 --> 01:51:12,780
yeah well you get rid of that but that

2625
01:51:10,739 --> 01:51:14,940
doesn't solve your problem does it the

2626
01:51:12,780 --> 01:51:17,610
problem is how do you exist in a world

2627
01:51:14,940 --> 01:51:19,590
full of monsters and part of that answer

2628
01:51:17,610 --> 01:51:22,920
is well you become a monster yourself

2629
01:51:19,590 --> 01:51:24,780
that's a big part of the answer but it's

2630
01:51:22,920 --> 01:51:26,489
an incomplete answer because if you're

2631
01:51:24,780 --> 01:51:28,889
just a monster then you're just as bad

2632
01:51:26,489 --> 01:51:31,080
as the monsters so you have to trance

2633
01:51:28,889 --> 01:51:32,760
you have to be a monstrous enough to

2634
01:51:31,080 --> 01:51:34,260
contend with the monsters but then you

2635
01:51:32,760 --> 01:51:36,150
have to be civilized enough so that

2636
01:51:34,260 --> 01:51:38,639
you're not a monster yourself and that's

2637
01:51:36,150 --> 01:51:42,960
more or less equivalent to the Union

2638
01:51:38,639 --> 01:51:45,500
inter integration of the shadow so yep

2639
01:51:42,960 --> 01:51:45,500
yeah

2640
01:51:51,130 --> 01:51:55,880
hiya dr. Peterson now I've been wanting

2641
01:51:53,480 --> 01:51:58,850
to ask you this for a while now since I

2642
01:51:55,880 --> 01:52:01,130
started watching your lectures after I

2643
01:51:58,850 --> 01:52:05,350
started reading and nici's Beyond Good

2644
01:52:01,130 --> 01:52:08,390
and Evil I came upon a paragraph in his

2645
01:52:05,350 --> 01:52:10,130
chapter on scholars that really really

2646
01:52:08,390 --> 01:52:12,770
bothered me and it actually bothers me

2647
01:52:10,130 --> 01:52:15,010
to this day he talked about this kind of

2648
01:52:12,770 --> 01:52:17,780
person like they were just a mirror-like

2649
01:52:15,010 --> 01:52:19,910
they stretched he said every part of

2650
01:52:17,780 --> 01:52:22,640
their skin basically to allow every new

2651
01:52:19,910 --> 01:52:25,130
piece of information that they took on

2652
01:52:22,640 --> 01:52:26,720
and that all they ever were was just an

2653
01:52:25,130 --> 01:52:29,030
instrument they were just a mirror on

2654
01:52:26,720 --> 01:52:31,400
reflecting what they had learned never

2655
01:52:29,030 --> 01:52:32,960
actually having generated anything on

2656
01:52:31,400 --> 01:52:34,700
their own and it's it's bothered me

2657
01:52:32,960 --> 01:52:37,700
because I feel like in a way it's sort

2658
01:52:34,700 --> 01:52:39,530
of like it's it's it's impacted my

2659
01:52:37,700 --> 01:52:42,140
identity a lot because I don't know how

2660
01:52:39,530 --> 01:52:44,720
are you supposed to create something you

2661
01:52:42,140 --> 01:52:45,590
know ok well that's ok that that's a

2662
01:52:44,720 --> 01:52:48,020
really good question

2663
01:52:45,590 --> 01:52:50,510
I mean Nietzsche is often classed with

2664
01:52:48,020 --> 01:52:52,310
the existentialists right and so one of

2665
01:52:50,510 --> 01:52:54,280
the tenants of existentialist there's

2666
01:52:52,310 --> 01:52:56,870
two real tenants of existentialism

2667
01:52:54,280 --> 01:52:59,480
there's more but obviously we're

2668
01:52:56,870 --> 01:53:01,820
oversimplifying but one is that life is

2669
01:52:59,480 --> 01:53:04,640
a problem it isn't because there's

2670
01:53:01,820 --> 01:53:06,680
something wrong with you it's that life

2671
01:53:04,640 --> 01:53:09,260
is a problem and so that's often

2672
01:53:06,680 --> 01:53:10,850
contrasted with the Freudian view which

2673
01:53:09,260 --> 01:53:13,070
is that if you have a problem it's

2674
01:53:10,850 --> 01:53:15,230
because something went wrong during your

2675
01:53:13,070 --> 01:53:18,680
development the existentialist said no

2676
01:53:15,230 --> 01:53:22,840
no it's like life is a problem make no

2677
01:53:18,680 --> 01:53:22,840
mistake about it and that

2678
01:53:28,690 --> 01:53:35,000
the purpose of the purpose of

2679
01:53:33,020 --> 01:53:38,900
scholarship is in some sense to solve

2680
01:53:35,000 --> 01:53:40,880
that problem and so for Nietzsche like

2681
01:53:38,900 --> 01:53:44,090
he said all truths are bloody truths to

2682
01:53:40,880 --> 01:53:47,120
me and what he meant by that was that if

2683
01:53:44,090 --> 01:53:49,550
an idea didn't incarnate itself in you

2684
01:53:47,120 --> 01:53:51,860
and transform your perceptions and your

2685
01:53:49,550 --> 01:53:53,150
actions then you were merely possessed

2686
01:53:51,860 --> 01:53:55,730
by the idea you were merely a

2687
01:53:53,150 --> 01:53:57,710
spokesperson for the idea or you could

2688
01:53:55,730 --> 01:54:01,790
say that the idea possessed you you're a

2689
01:53:57,710 --> 01:54:03,830
puppet for the idea it's not you it's

2690
01:54:01,790 --> 01:54:06,530
the idea is in you and it has you you

2691
01:54:03,830 --> 01:54:08,000
haven't taken the idea and incorporated

2692
01:54:06,530 --> 01:54:11,000
with you and made it part of your life

2693
01:54:08,000 --> 01:54:12,650
and so there's a romanticism that's

2694
01:54:11,000 --> 01:54:15,020
associated with that right that's the

2695
01:54:12,650 --> 01:54:19,070
passionate scholar the person for whom

2696
01:54:15,020 --> 01:54:22,090
ideas are not merely they're not merely

2697
01:54:19,070 --> 01:54:24,800
what would you call abstracted

2698
01:54:22,090 --> 01:54:28,700
representations that can be tossed about

2699
01:54:24,800 --> 01:54:30,440
as if they're commodities there there

2700
01:54:28,700 --> 01:54:32,000
there are more like pert they're more

2701
01:54:30,440 --> 01:54:35,930
like personalities that might be another

2702
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:38,480
way of thinking about it and so if

2703
01:54:35,930 --> 01:54:42,380
you're if if those ideas are compelling

2704
01:54:38,480 --> 01:54:44,660
then you don't like one thing I learned

2705
01:54:42,380 --> 01:54:46,940
a long time ago and I think this is

2706
01:54:44,660 --> 01:54:49,640
probably relevant I know when I was a

2707
01:54:46,940 --> 01:54:52,640
kid I like to argue and I like to win

2708
01:54:49,640 --> 01:54:54,350
arguments or or or lose them although I

2709
01:54:52,640 --> 01:54:56,420
like winning them a lot better but I

2710
01:54:54,350 --> 01:54:58,970
didn't really mind so much what the

2711
01:54:56,420 --> 01:55:02,600
content of the argument was you know I

2712
01:54:58,970 --> 01:55:04,520
could engage in it like a sparring match

2713
01:55:02,600 --> 01:55:05,600
and it was in some sense to establish

2714
01:55:04,520 --> 01:55:07,670
dominance right to establish

2715
01:55:05,600 --> 01:55:10,510
intellectual dominance I quit doing that

2716
01:55:07,670 --> 01:55:13,760
when I was in my mid-20s because I

2717
01:55:10,510 --> 01:55:16,220
thought that that was too shallow an

2718
01:55:13,760 --> 01:55:20,240
approach to the ideas they they're not

2719
01:55:16,220 --> 01:55:23,450
commodities of that sort they're there

2720
01:55:20,240 --> 01:55:24,920
they have tendrils that reach down into

2721
01:55:23,450 --> 01:55:27,620
the living that's the right way to think

2722
01:55:24,920 --> 01:55:29,920
about it and so Nietzsche's criticism of

2723
01:55:27,620 --> 01:55:32,930
scholars and he did this a lot was that

2724
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:34,940
they were bloodless you know they didn't

2725
01:55:32,930 --> 01:55:36,470
they were full of performative

2726
01:55:34,940 --> 01:55:38,000
contradictions that's another way of

2727
01:55:36,470 --> 01:55:39,920
thinking about they'd say one thing and

2728
01:55:38,000 --> 01:55:41,809
do another because their intellect was

2729
01:55:39,920 --> 01:55:44,929
completely dissociated from their

2730
01:55:41,809 --> 01:55:47,750
from their actions and Heath he he

2731
01:55:44,929 --> 01:55:50,389
thought that was a very bad idea and I

2732
01:55:47,750 --> 01:55:52,250
think that that's a good criticism I

2733
01:55:50,389 --> 01:55:53,869
think it is a bad idea I also think it

2734
01:55:52,250 --> 01:55:56,329
makes for an extraordinarily boring

2735
01:55:53,869 --> 01:55:58,130
lecturer you know because you can tell

2736
01:55:56,329 --> 01:55:59,659
if you're listening to someone whether

2737
01:55:58,130 --> 01:56:01,820
the idea is that you're hearing are

2738
01:55:59,659 --> 01:56:04,039
merely being passed through the person

2739
01:56:01,820 --> 01:56:06,530
as if they're being memorized say or

2740
01:56:04,039 --> 01:56:09,349
whether they're part of the dynamic core

2741
01:56:06,530 --> 01:56:10,969
of the person and if they're part of the

2742
01:56:09,349 --> 01:56:13,219
dynamic core of the person then they're

2743
01:56:10,969 --> 01:56:16,550
almost always engaging and gripping and

2744
01:56:13,219 --> 01:56:18,230
so he wasn't a fan of bloodless scholars

2745
01:56:16,550 --> 01:56:21,980
and I think that's correct because one

2746
01:56:18,230 --> 01:56:25,119
of the things that I see it's not a good

2747
01:56:21,980 --> 01:56:27,639
idea to have ideas possess you unless

2748
01:56:25,119 --> 01:56:31,010
you know what the ideas are up to and

2749
01:56:27,639 --> 01:56:32,510
lots of people are possessed by ideas

2750
01:56:31,010 --> 01:56:34,070
rather than possessing them and that

2751
01:56:32,510 --> 01:56:36,199
what that means is they haven't taken

2752
01:56:34,070 --> 01:56:36,920
the ideas and integrated them into their

2753
01:56:36,199 --> 01:56:40,400
own being

2754
01:56:36,920 --> 01:56:42,170
they haven't it's like an incarnation in

2755
01:56:40,400 --> 01:56:46,610
a sense they haven't incarnated the

2756
01:56:42,170 --> 01:56:47,630
ideas in an embodied form and and so

2757
01:56:46,610 --> 01:56:50,329
they're incomplete

2758
01:56:47,630 --> 01:56:52,309
you know Nietzsche also in thus spake

2759
01:56:50,329 --> 01:56:54,380
Zarathustra when Zarathustra comes down

2760
01:56:52,309 --> 01:56:56,780
the mountain he sees a bunch of people

2761
01:56:54,380 --> 01:56:58,340
gathered around a famous individual I

2762
01:56:56,780 --> 01:56:58,699
think maybe a scholar but doesn't really

2763
01:56:58,340 --> 01:57:01,099
matter

2764
01:56:58,699 --> 01:57:02,599
and when Zarathustra goes in looks at

2765
01:57:01,099 --> 01:57:05,719
the person all he sees his little tiny

2766
01:57:02,599 --> 01:57:07,909
 with a gigantic ear and so he's a

2767
01:57:05,719 --> 01:57:10,099
hyper specialist right and so he has a

2768
01:57:07,909 --> 01:57:12,800
pretty impressive ear but he's only this

2769
01:57:10,099 --> 01:57:14,539
big and that was Nietzsche's imagistic

2770
01:57:12,800 --> 01:57:17,179
commentary on the danger of hyper

2771
01:57:14,539 --> 01:57:19,340
specialization and also on the danger of

2772
01:57:17,179 --> 01:57:21,619
adulation for hyperspecialization

2773
01:57:19,340 --> 01:57:22,750
and and because he thought about it as a

2774
01:57:21,619 --> 01:57:27,369
kind of deformity

2775
01:57:22,750 --> 01:57:27,369
now Nietzsche was a pretty harsh guy but

2776
01:57:28,239 --> 01:57:33,050
but he did address the issue of the

2777
01:57:30,739 --> 01:57:35,630
relationship between intellectual

2778
01:57:33,050 --> 01:57:37,429
knowledge and and action because for

2779
01:57:35,630 --> 01:57:42,230
Nietzsche those things are not to be

2780
01:57:37,429 --> 01:57:44,690
separated in some sense so yeah so maybe

2781
01:57:42,230 --> 01:57:47,420
I don't know why it maybe it bothered

2782
01:57:44,690 --> 01:57:49,159
you like it's hard to say why it

2783
01:57:47,420 --> 01:57:51,409
bothered you it might have bothered you

2784
01:57:49,159 --> 01:57:53,599
because it's sort of undermined the idea

2785
01:57:51,409 --> 01:57:54,920
of scholar but the other possibility and

2786
01:57:53,599 --> 01:57:55,520
this isn't an accusation because

2787
01:57:54,920 --> 01:57:57,080
obviously

2788
01:57:55,520 --> 01:57:59,300
I don't know anything about you but it

2789
01:57:57,080 --> 01:58:02,200
might also be that it struck a chord you

2790
01:57:59,300 --> 01:58:07,360
know and that maybe you were doubtful or

2791
01:58:02,200 --> 01:58:11,540
questioning how tightly associated your

2792
01:58:07,360 --> 01:58:14,900
intellectual endeavor was with your

2793
01:58:11,540 --> 01:58:16,520
actual character and your practice so

2794
01:58:14,900 --> 01:58:17,600
that's another possibility I mean that's

2795
01:58:16,520 --> 01:58:19,370
a really good thing to think about

2796
01:58:17,600 --> 01:58:21,590
because generally speaking that

2797
01:58:19,370 --> 01:58:24,500
integration is it is very much lacking

2798
01:58:21,590 --> 01:58:26,690
people are a lot smarter and fluid with

2799
01:58:24,500 --> 01:58:29,900
their ideas than they are ethical and

2800
01:58:26,690 --> 01:58:34,840
consistent and characterized by

2801
01:58:29,900 --> 01:58:34,840
integrity so yep

2802
01:58:42,020 --> 01:58:47,099
hey um so last week you talked about how

2803
01:58:45,360 --> 01:58:48,570
you hated people asking you if you

2804
01:58:47,099 --> 01:58:49,800
believe in God or do you believe in

2805
01:58:48,570 --> 01:58:51,960
miracles or you just like those

2806
01:58:49,800 --> 01:58:53,699
questions elytis but you also talked

2807
01:58:51,960 --> 01:58:54,449
about how and I want to put words in

2808
01:58:53,699 --> 01:58:56,699
your mouth but I think you said

2809
01:58:54,449 --> 01:58:59,070
something about the idea of an empirical

2810
01:58:56,699 --> 01:59:01,110
evidence for religious experiences or

2811
01:58:59,070 --> 01:59:04,170
spiritual experiences and I wonder how

2812
01:59:01,110 --> 01:59:06,060
those two ideas can a spiritual

2813
01:59:04,170 --> 01:59:11,449
existence or can a spiritual experience

2814
01:59:06,060 --> 01:59:13,920
exist without God or who knows who knows

2815
01:59:11,449 --> 01:59:15,659
you know I don't know what I don't know

2816
01:59:13,920 --> 01:59:17,429
what to make of that I mean you could it

2817
01:59:15,659 --> 01:59:20,429
depends on what you're willing to accept

2818
01:59:17,429 --> 01:59:22,770
as proof I suppose that's where things

2819
01:59:20,429 --> 01:59:24,719
get tricky you know if you have to

2820
01:59:22,770 --> 01:59:27,360
demonstrate the existence of God

2821
01:59:24,719 --> 01:59:30,300
objectively then subjective experiences

2822
01:59:27,360 --> 01:59:33,329
of the transcendent are irrelevant right

2823
01:59:30,300 --> 01:59:35,099
but and and that's a perfectly

2824
01:59:33,329 --> 01:59:37,679
reasonable standpoint if your initial

2825
01:59:35,099 --> 01:59:39,449
presupposition is the only thing that

2826
01:59:37,679 --> 01:59:41,460
has actual existence is those things

2827
01:59:39,449 --> 01:59:44,130
that can be demonstrated objectively and

2828
01:59:41,460 --> 01:59:46,590
I'm not putting that down like that's a

2829
01:59:44,130 --> 01:59:49,199
powerful methodology our technology is

2830
01:59:46,590 --> 01:59:50,940
basically dependent on the acceptance at

2831
01:59:49,199 --> 01:59:54,179
least a partial acceptance of those

2832
01:59:50,940 --> 01:59:59,190
axioms but I also think that it's

2833
01:59:54,179 --> 02:00:01,949
difficult for me to deny the existence

2834
01:59:59,190 --> 02:00:04,650
of these patterns of thinking that seem

2835
02:00:01,949 --> 02:00:06,480
to exist cross-culturally like the

2836
02:00:04,650 --> 02:00:09,570
existence of the representation of the

2837
02:00:06,480 --> 02:00:11,969
Dragon for example especially given that

2838
02:00:09,570 --> 02:00:14,150
I can see an evolutionary rationale for

2839
02:00:11,969 --> 02:00:17,570
the emergence of these representations

2840
02:00:14,150 --> 02:00:20,280
so and then there's also the

2841
02:00:17,570 --> 02:00:23,360
indisputable fact that religious

2842
02:00:20,280 --> 02:00:25,760
experiences are accessible to people

2843
02:00:23,360 --> 02:00:28,760
through a number of different avenues

2844
02:00:25,760 --> 02:00:31,260
now and one of the things I mentioned

2845
02:00:28,760 --> 02:00:32,969
when I discussed this before is well you

2846
02:00:31,260 --> 02:00:36,750
could say well those are no different

2847
02:00:32,969 --> 02:00:38,099
than experiences of psychopathology but

2848
02:00:36,750 --> 02:00:40,409
they are different because the

2849
02:00:38,099 --> 02:00:43,079
experiences of psychopathology damage

2850
02:00:40,409 --> 02:00:45,270
people whereas the evidence is that the

2851
02:00:43,079 --> 02:00:47,849
transcendent experiences actually help

2852
02:00:45,270 --> 02:00:49,469
people so unless you can unless you're

2853
02:00:47,849 --> 02:00:51,360
willing to say well there are some forms

2854
02:00:49,469 --> 02:00:54,690
of psychopathological experience that

2855
02:00:51,360 --> 02:00:56,400
actually facilitate health which is

2856
02:00:54,690 --> 02:00:59,280
possibility but you know I think you're

2857
02:00:56,400 --> 02:01:06,540
you're pushing your hypothesis at that

2858
02:00:59,280 --> 02:01:09,500
point I'm not sure what you're saying

2859
02:01:06,540 --> 02:01:12,449
about a religious experience is what I'm

2860
02:01:09,500 --> 02:01:15,330
well generally a religious experience is

2861
02:01:12,449 --> 02:01:17,520
something like an experience of the of

2862
02:01:15,330 --> 02:01:19,469
the renewal of the world that might be

2863
02:01:17,520 --> 02:01:21,770
one way of thinking about it so that

2864
02:01:19,469 --> 02:01:25,020
everything sort of leaps forward as

2865
02:01:21,770 --> 02:01:26,820
crystalline and perfect as if you had

2866
02:01:25,020 --> 02:01:30,540
been viewing it from behind a mask

2867
02:01:26,820 --> 02:01:33,210
before another would be a sense of the

2868
02:01:30,540 --> 02:01:35,250
union of everything and so you're a

2869
02:01:33,210 --> 02:01:36,989
singular being and you're isolated and

2870
02:01:35,250 --> 02:01:38,580
in the religious experiences so for

2871
02:01:36,989 --> 02:01:44,610
example there's a book written recently

2872
02:01:38,580 --> 02:01:47,610
by a neuroscientist my stroke of what's

2873
02:01:44,610 --> 02:01:49,860
it called my stroke of insight yeah

2874
02:01:47,610 --> 02:01:52,290
that's right and I believe she had a

2875
02:01:49,860 --> 02:01:56,870
left hemisphere stroke if I remember

2876
02:01:52,290 --> 02:01:58,980
correctly and she was sufficiently

2877
02:01:56,870 --> 02:02:00,840
well-developed neuroscientists to

2878
02:01:58,980 --> 02:02:04,800
understand what was happening as she had

2879
02:02:00,840 --> 02:02:07,080
the stroke and and she had a intense

2880
02:02:04,800 --> 02:02:09,540
religious experience as a consequence of

2881
02:02:07,080 --> 02:02:12,210
that and she experienced it as a

2882
02:02:09,540 --> 02:02:14,270
dissolution of the ego into this state

2883
02:02:12,210 --> 02:02:17,250
of union with everything and this

2884
02:02:14,270 --> 02:02:19,739
transcendent experience of awe and and

2885
02:02:17,250 --> 02:02:21,480
the open well I don't remember the rest

2886
02:02:19,739 --> 02:02:22,860
of it I mean there are other elements of

2887
02:02:21,480 --> 02:02:24,480
religious experience that are quite

2888
02:02:22,860 --> 02:02:26,969
common the idea of the opening of the

2889
02:02:24,480 --> 02:02:29,310
heavens that's one the communion with

2890
02:02:26,969 --> 02:02:31,260
the ancestors that's another the

2891
02:02:29,310 --> 02:02:34,320
reduction of the body to a skeleton

2892
02:02:31,260 --> 02:02:37,410
that's another movement up into heaven

2893
02:02:34,320 --> 02:02:40,199
like these are well documented phenomena

2894
02:02:37,410 --> 02:02:41,699
and a lot of them are associated well of

2895
02:02:40,199 --> 02:02:43,380
a fair number of them were associated

2896
02:02:41,699 --> 02:02:45,750
with psychedelic use but that's not the

2897
02:02:43,380 --> 02:02:48,030
only Avenue to experiences like that and

2898
02:02:45,750 --> 02:02:50,520
epilepsy can produce experiences like

2899
02:02:48,030 --> 02:02:52,800
that too and then people usually report

2900
02:02:50,520 --> 02:02:54,449
a near-death experience as well you know

2901
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:56,360
people usually report that those

2902
02:02:54,449 --> 02:02:59,989
experiences have life-altering

2903
02:02:56,360 --> 02:03:02,910
significance now that in and of itself

2904
02:02:59,989 --> 02:03:04,949
only proves that people are capable of

2905
02:03:02,910 --> 02:03:05,640
having subjective religious experiences

2906
02:03:04,949 --> 02:03:08,490
right

2907
02:03:05,640 --> 02:03:10,830
it doesn't definitively prove

2908
02:03:08,490 --> 02:03:13,050
there's anything outside of that so

2909
02:03:10,830 --> 02:03:15,570
young Carl young for example most of the

2910
02:03:13,050 --> 02:03:18,360
time he didn't talk about God he talked

2911
02:03:15,570 --> 02:03:20,040
about the God image which is not the

2912
02:03:18,360 --> 02:03:22,110
same thing because you could have a god

2913
02:03:20,040 --> 02:03:24,600
image that was even evolutionarily

2914
02:03:22,110 --> 02:03:29,010
instantiated without that necessarily

2915
02:03:24,600 --> 02:03:33,570
being rep to any transcendent being

2916
02:03:29,010 --> 02:03:38,070
beyond the image right so who knows who

2917
02:03:33,570 --> 02:03:40,470
knows again I think it depends on what

2918
02:03:38,070 --> 02:03:44,190
you're willing to accept as proof now

2919
02:03:40,470 --> 02:03:45,770
the proof the it's beyond question that

2920
02:03:44,190 --> 02:03:48,390
can people can have life-changing

2921
02:03:45,770 --> 02:03:50,850
religious experiences another example of

2922
02:03:48,390 --> 02:03:53,520
that is that the best treatment for

2923
02:03:50,850 --> 02:03:55,170
alcoholism is religious conversion it's

2924
02:03:53,520 --> 02:03:57,390
well documented in the literature and I

2925
02:03:55,170 --> 02:04:00,540
studied alcoholism for a long time so

2926
02:03:57,390 --> 02:04:02,580
one of the cures that sticks is

2927
02:04:00,540 --> 02:04:04,140
religious conversion and the 12-step

2928
02:04:02,580 --> 02:04:06,320
programs essentially attempt to

2929
02:04:04,140 --> 02:04:08,910
instantiate religious conversion and

2930
02:04:06,320 --> 02:04:11,370
it's hard to document their success

2931
02:04:08,910 --> 02:04:13,310
because they succeed for the people who

2932
02:04:11,370 --> 02:04:17,120
stick with it but that's not a very good

2933
02:04:13,310 --> 02:04:18,930
measure right it's sort of it's sort of

2934
02:04:17,120 --> 02:04:21,000
self-evident that they work for the

2935
02:04:18,930 --> 02:04:23,220
people who stick with it I'm not cynical

2936
02:04:21,000 --> 02:04:24,630
about about Alcoholics Anonymous or

2937
02:04:23,220 --> 02:04:28,290
anything but we don't have good data on

2938
02:04:24,630 --> 02:04:30,570
on outcome but there is good data

2939
02:04:28,290 --> 02:04:33,810
showing that religious transformation is

2940
02:04:30,570 --> 02:04:42,240
a good cure for for alcoholism so and

2941
02:04:33,810 --> 02:04:47,310
that's an interesting phenomena too it's

2942
02:04:42,240 --> 02:04:49,080
too complicated I probably can't okay

2943
02:04:47,310 --> 02:04:50,310
I'll try I'll try this for a second so

2944
02:04:49,080 --> 02:04:52,830
here's how I think a religious

2945
02:04:50,310 --> 02:04:54,750
conversion might work so imagine you've

2946
02:04:52,830 --> 02:04:55,760
got the left hemisphere and it's the

2947
02:04:54,750 --> 02:05:00,090
place where your habitual

2948
02:04:55,760 --> 02:05:03,120
interpretations reside so I can give you

2949
02:05:00,090 --> 02:05:05,240
a quick example of this so this guy

2950
02:05:03,120 --> 02:05:08,190
Ramachandran who's a neurophysiologist

2951
02:05:05,240 --> 02:05:11,430
or I think that's his that's his field

2952
02:05:08,190 --> 02:05:13,560
of study I think he's at UCLA he studied

2953
02:05:11,430 --> 02:05:16,590
people who hadn't neglect and neglects

2954
02:05:13,560 --> 02:05:18,180
is a very very bizarre phenomena so if

2955
02:05:16,590 --> 02:05:20,700
you have a stroke that damages your

2956
02:05:18,180 --> 02:05:22,020
right parietal lobe you'll lose the left

2957
02:05:20,700 --> 02:05:24,360
part of your

2958
02:05:22,020 --> 02:05:26,310
being not just your body it's really

2959
02:05:24,360 --> 02:05:29,280
weird it's like so for example if you

2960
02:05:26,310 --> 02:05:31,950
have a right parietal stroke and you

2961
02:05:29,280 --> 02:05:34,560
look at a clock you only see you only

2962
02:05:31,950 --> 02:05:36,450
only half the clock exists for you it's

2963
02:05:34,560 --> 02:05:38,670
not like you only see half the clock

2964
02:05:36,450 --> 02:05:40,950
it's weirder than that it's that there's

2965
02:05:38,670 --> 02:05:42,780
only the right side of the clock there's

2966
02:05:40,950 --> 02:05:45,060
only the right side of you there's only

2967
02:05:42,780 --> 02:05:47,880
the right side of my body I don't know

2968
02:05:45,060 --> 02:05:50,070
that this exists and so sometimes people

2969
02:05:47,880 --> 02:05:52,650
with right parietal damage will wake up

2970
02:05:50,070 --> 02:05:54,810
after the stroke and grab their left arm

2971
02:05:52,650 --> 02:05:56,490
and throw it out of bed and or their leg

2972
02:05:54,810 --> 02:05:58,170
and throw it out of bed because it's not

2973
02:05:56,490 --> 02:06:00,480
theirs and then of course they fall out

2974
02:05:58,170 --> 02:06:03,570
of bed which is quite a shock to them so

2975
02:06:00,480 --> 02:06:05,370
and so now they'll only eat half the

2976
02:06:03,570 --> 02:06:07,110
food on the plate nobody can really

2977
02:06:05,370 --> 02:06:09,300
understand this phenomena logically

2978
02:06:07,110 --> 02:06:11,670
right because we can't imagine what that

2979
02:06:09,300 --> 02:06:13,710
must be like I think it must be like you

2980
02:06:11,670 --> 02:06:16,800
know how you know there's things behind

2981
02:06:13,710 --> 02:06:18,480
you but you don't not see them they're

2982
02:06:16,800 --> 02:06:20,640
just not there it's not like it's black

2983
02:06:18,480 --> 02:06:23,880
or anything or there's a space it's just

2984
02:06:20,640 --> 02:06:27,000
not there and so I think what happens is

2985
02:06:23,880 --> 02:06:28,800
the not there extends to three-quarters

2986
02:06:27,000 --> 02:06:33,090
of the field instead of half the field

2987
02:06:28,800 --> 02:06:35,190
that's a guess anyway so ramas now the

2988
02:06:33,090 --> 02:06:37,380
funny thing about people with neglect is

2989
02:06:35,190 --> 02:06:39,060
that if you tell them if you point it

2990
02:06:37,380 --> 02:06:41,700
out you say well I noticed that you're

2991
02:06:39,060 --> 02:06:44,820
not moving your left foot today they'll

2992
02:06:41,700 --> 02:06:46,710
say well it's it's arthritic and I can't

2993
02:06:44,820 --> 02:06:48,090
move it and say well why do you just try

2994
02:06:46,710 --> 02:06:49,620
to move it so no look doctor I already

2995
02:06:48,090 --> 02:06:51,420
told you it's in too much pain to move

2996
02:06:49,620 --> 02:06:54,120
it was working fine this morning that

2997
02:06:51,420 --> 02:06:56,370
can be months after the the accident so

2998
02:06:54,120 --> 02:06:58,170
it's a denial and and people thought

2999
02:06:56,370 --> 02:07:00,030
actually that that was trauma induced

3000
02:06:58,170 --> 02:07:00,960
denial for a long time before they

3001
02:07:00,030 --> 02:07:02,280
figured it out was actually a

3002
02:07:00,960 --> 02:07:05,100
consequence of the neurophysiological

3003
02:07:02,280 --> 02:07:10,070
damage you know Ramachandran found that

3004
02:07:05,100 --> 02:07:13,710
if you irrigated the contralateral ear

3005
02:07:10,070 --> 02:07:16,260
say now if you pour cold water in

3006
02:07:13,710 --> 02:07:17,760
someone's ear it upsets their vestibular

3007
02:07:16,260 --> 02:07:19,950
system and their eyes will move back and

3008
02:07:17,760 --> 02:07:23,580
forth like this you can try that at a

3009
02:07:19,950 --> 02:07:25,680
party if you want and anyways

3010
02:07:23,580 --> 02:07:27,060
Ramachandran was testing vestibular

3011
02:07:25,680 --> 02:07:29,700
function on these patients and he

3012
02:07:27,060 --> 02:07:32,580
irrigated the right ear with cold water

3013
02:07:29,700 --> 02:07:35,789
and they woke up and maybe what happened

3014
02:07:32,580 --> 02:07:37,440
was that that was shocking enough

3015
02:07:35,789 --> 02:07:39,719
so imagine the networks in the right

3016
02:07:37,440 --> 02:07:41,849
hemisphere were degraded but not

3017
02:07:39,719 --> 02:07:43,920
completely gone and they needed a really

3018
02:07:41,849 --> 02:07:46,289
high threshold of activation to snap

3019
02:07:43,920 --> 02:07:47,969
into function so here's an example of

3020
02:07:46,289 --> 02:07:50,699
that if you have Parkinson's disease

3021
02:07:47,969 --> 02:07:52,260
imagine you're frozen there okay and I

3022
02:07:50,699 --> 02:07:55,639
throw a ball at you you'll go like this

3023
02:07:52,260 --> 02:07:59,579
and catch it but you can't throw it back

3024
02:07:55,639 --> 02:08:01,590
so you can the stimulus is enough that's

3025
02:07:59,579 --> 02:08:03,360
enough to push you past threshold but

3026
02:08:01,590 --> 02:08:05,699
you can't do it voluntarily now if you

3027
02:08:03,360 --> 02:08:07,260
have Parkinson's like right to the tenth

3028
02:08:05,699 --> 02:08:09,030
degree you won't even be able to couch

3029
02:08:07,260 --> 02:08:10,949
it but there's a stage where you could

3030
02:08:09,030 --> 02:08:13,739
still do that there's a great case study

3031
02:08:10,949 --> 02:08:15,360
where this grandpa was in a wheelchair

3032
02:08:13,739 --> 02:08:17,730
he had Parkinson's and his young

3033
02:08:15,360 --> 02:08:19,440
grandson was playing out on the dock and

3034
02:08:17,730 --> 02:08:22,230
fell in the water and started to drown

3035
02:08:19,440 --> 02:08:24,929
and he got out of his wheelchair went

3036
02:08:22,230 --> 02:08:26,940
into the ocean rescued him brought him

3037
02:08:24,929 --> 02:08:29,400
onto the beach sat back down in his

3038
02:08:26,940 --> 02:08:30,989
wheelchair and was paralyzed together so

3039
02:08:29,400 --> 02:08:32,880
that was enough so you can imagine there

3040
02:08:30,989 --> 02:08:36,239
was enough network left so if the

3041
02:08:32,880 --> 02:08:38,039
emotional tension became high enough

3042
02:08:36,239 --> 02:08:41,340
that the degraded circuits could still

3043
02:08:38,039 --> 02:08:43,380
function so okay so back to Ramachandran

3044
02:08:41,340 --> 02:08:45,929
so you irrigate the ear all of a sudden

3045
02:08:43,380 --> 02:08:48,510
the right hemisphere connections flash

3046
02:08:45,929 --> 02:08:50,519
the remainders managed to connect and

3047
02:08:48,510 --> 02:08:52,349
the person goes oh my god I've had a

3048
02:08:50,519 --> 02:08:54,659
terrible stroke I've lost the left side

3049
02:08:52,349 --> 02:08:57,239
of my body they're crying they're like

3050
02:08:54,659 --> 02:09:00,179
completely catastrophic aliy overwhelmed

3051
02:08:57,239 --> 02:09:02,190
by it and then 20 minutes later the the

3052
02:09:00,179 --> 02:09:04,889
effects wear off and they snap back in

3053
02:09:02,190 --> 02:09:06,780
and now they they've lost their left

3054
02:09:04,889 --> 02:09:09,780
side again they don't remember it and so

3055
02:09:06,780 --> 02:09:13,559
what seems to happen is that the right

3056
02:09:09,780 --> 02:09:15,900
hemisphere is collecting anomalous

3057
02:09:13,559 --> 02:09:17,639
information that's what it does that's

3058
02:09:15,900 --> 02:09:20,820
what it does when you're dreaming it's

3059
02:09:17,639 --> 02:09:23,039
it's it's it's representing that

3060
02:09:20,820 --> 02:09:25,320
anomalous information in image form and

3061
02:09:23,039 --> 02:09:27,360
sort of slowly passing it to the left

3062
02:09:25,320 --> 02:09:29,369
hemisphere so it doesn't overwhelm it

3063
02:09:27,360 --> 02:09:30,809
and maybe if it gets overwhelming you

3064
02:09:29,369 --> 02:09:32,610
wake up and you're afraid and you tell

3065
02:09:30,809 --> 02:09:34,730
someone about the dream that helps you

3066
02:09:32,610 --> 02:09:36,840
figure out what it was but anyways so

3067
02:09:34,730 --> 02:09:39,590
that the right hemisphere is always

3068
02:09:36,840 --> 02:09:42,949
trying to tap the left hemisphere into

3069
02:09:39,590 --> 02:09:47,369
transformation right so now imagine that

3070
02:09:42,949 --> 02:09:49,050
that can happen a little bit or a lot so

3071
02:09:47,369 --> 02:09:49,680
maybe you're just ignoring a little bit

3072
02:09:49,050 --> 02:09:52,200
of anomalous

3073
02:09:49,680 --> 02:09:54,210
information you just have some mildly

3074
02:09:52,200 --> 02:09:56,220
frightening dreams or maybe you've just

3075
02:09:54,210 --> 02:09:57,270
stacked up a whole bunch of things that

3076
02:09:56,220 --> 02:09:59,970
you're ignoring and there's some

3077
02:09:57,270 --> 02:10:02,010
major-league monsters that you haven't

3078
02:09:59,970 --> 02:10:05,160
contended with maybe there's situations

3079
02:10:02,010 --> 02:10:09,000
where the right hemisphere is stored up

3080
02:10:05,160 --> 02:10:11,430
enough counter enough of a counter

3081
02:10:09,000 --> 02:10:12,030
hypothesis let's say about how the world

3082
02:10:11,430 --> 02:10:14,040
works

3083
02:10:12,030 --> 02:10:16,470
out make making sense out of all those

3084
02:10:14,040 --> 02:10:19,740
things that you've ignored that one day

3085
02:10:16,470 --> 02:10:22,170
it just goes snap and you're a new

3086
02:10:19,740 --> 02:10:25,470
personality and maybe the new

3087
02:10:22,170 --> 02:10:27,090
personality isn't addicted so it's

3088
02:10:25,470 --> 02:10:33,080
something like it's something like that

3089
02:10:27,090 --> 02:10:33,080
I think so yeah okay

3090
02:10:38,150 --> 02:10:46,350
joke good morning citizen Peterson oh

3091
02:10:43,610 --> 02:10:48,330
you got I've prepared a real doozy for

3092
02:10:46,350 --> 02:10:50,220
you here oh good it's a good thing

3093
02:10:48,330 --> 02:10:52,620
you've got extra time to handle this one

3094
02:10:50,220 --> 02:10:55,080
I'd even say it's rehearsed a little bit

3095
02:10:52,620 --> 02:11:00,660
so it's gonna be ultra ineffective yeah

3096
02:10:55,080 --> 02:11:03,210
okay now I understand that a lecture on

3097
02:11:00,660 --> 02:11:03,989
the psychological significance of

3098
02:11:03,210 --> 02:11:07,020
anything really

3099
02:11:03,989 --> 02:11:11,540
is going to indubitably wander off into

3100
02:11:07,020 --> 02:11:15,060
an anthropocentric worldview but as a

3101
02:11:11,540 --> 02:11:17,700
practitioner of the hard sciences I

3102
02:11:15,060 --> 02:11:20,910
wanted to dig a little bit deeper you

3103
02:11:17,700 --> 02:11:23,250
know so I sought out I guess a religious

3104
02:11:20,910 --> 02:11:30,750
interpretation of both creative freedom

3105
02:11:23,250 --> 02:11:35,010
and I guess the very nature of time

3106
02:11:30,750 --> 02:11:37,739
itself and I found it obviously that's

3107
02:11:35,010 --> 02:11:40,170
why I'm here and if you think you have

3108
02:11:37,739 --> 02:11:42,390
an anthropocentric worldview it's

3109
02:11:40,170 --> 02:11:47,040
nothing compared to Joseph Cardinal

3110
02:11:42,390 --> 02:11:50,640
Ratzinger you know now I like to think

3111
02:11:47,040 --> 02:11:52,440
that you know this microphone here the

3112
02:11:50,640 --> 02:11:55,230
one that you keep muting out on me

3113
02:11:52,440 --> 02:11:57,720
you know this microphone is an object

3114
02:11:55,230 --> 02:11:59,910
which exists outside of our individual

3115
02:11:57,720 --> 02:12:04,110
perceptions that's just the way I like

3116
02:11:59,910 --> 02:12:06,480
to look at it but then I think about the

3117
02:12:04,110 --> 02:12:09,630
concept beauty is in the eye of the

3118
02:12:06,480 --> 02:12:12,120
beholder and certainly I mean when

3119
02:12:09,630 --> 02:12:14,310
you're talking about are the

3120
02:12:12,120 --> 02:12:16,290
appreciation of art there has to be some

3121
02:12:14,310 --> 02:12:19,890
sort of subjective element integrated

3122
02:12:16,290 --> 02:12:23,730
into that but there also must be a limit

3123
02:12:19,890 --> 02:12:26,940
as well I mean certain works of art do

3124
02:12:23,730 --> 02:12:30,060
we appreciate as absolute masterpieces

3125
02:12:26,940 --> 02:12:32,340
like Michelangelo's pietà for example

3126
02:12:30,060 --> 02:12:35,040
which you bring up frequently because it

3127
02:12:32,340 --> 02:12:37,680
really is that good but there's other

3128
02:12:35,040 --> 02:12:42,120
things which are just by comparison

3129
02:12:37,680 --> 02:12:44,790
there like vandalism you know now

3130
02:12:42,120 --> 02:12:47,239
there's always a temptation all right to

3131
02:12:44,790 --> 02:12:49,700
invoke the principle of a

3132
02:12:47,239 --> 02:12:51,870
non-overlapping magisteria

3133
02:12:49,700 --> 02:12:54,510
but that seems like sort

3134
02:12:51,870 --> 02:12:57,000
of a capo right so I formulated I guess

3135
02:12:54,510 --> 02:12:58,800
for myself for standards of measure

3136
02:12:57,000 --> 02:13:02,130
which help me separate what's the

3137
02:12:58,800 --> 02:13:06,290
difference between art and mediocrity

3138
02:13:02,130 --> 02:13:09,840
and here's the four number one education

3139
02:13:06,290 --> 02:13:11,460
number two time commitment you got to

3140
02:13:09,840 --> 02:13:13,770
put in the time if you're an artist it's

3141
02:13:11,460 --> 02:13:15,480
probably gonna become your full-time

3142
02:13:13,770 --> 02:13:16,470
occupation it's that you have to be that

3143
02:13:15,480 --> 02:13:20,430
passionate about it

3144
02:13:16,470 --> 02:13:22,410
number three public display art isn't

3145
02:13:20,430 --> 02:13:24,210
something that you own for yourself you

3146
02:13:22,410 --> 02:13:26,010
hide it in your basement then it's not

3147
02:13:24,210 --> 02:13:28,080
art it's something what you have to

3148
02:13:26,010 --> 02:13:30,330
express you know something which you've

3149
02:13:28,080 --> 02:13:35,490
got to share and number four and I think

3150
02:13:30,330 --> 02:13:38,610
this is the most important one efficacy

3151
02:13:35,490 --> 02:13:40,560
of vision if you're an artist you've got

3152
02:13:38,610 --> 02:13:42,870
to have a vision and we talked about the

3153
02:13:40,560 --> 02:13:44,790
dream state here a lot you go into the

3154
02:13:42,870 --> 02:13:46,500
dream state you have inspiration but

3155
02:13:44,790 --> 02:13:47,820
it's not enough to just have the

3156
02:13:46,500 --> 02:13:51,330
inspiration because that's totally

3157
02:13:47,820 --> 02:13:54,090
subjective for you the art the art part

3158
02:13:51,330 --> 02:13:56,250
about it is having the techniques and

3159
02:13:54,090 --> 02:13:57,840
the skill and the intent and I guess the

3160
02:13:56,250 --> 02:14:01,260
capacity to turn that into something

3161
02:13:57,840 --> 02:14:03,660
real you know that you can then express

3162
02:14:01,260 --> 02:14:06,420
or share so can you read cardinal

3163
02:14:03,660 --> 02:14:08,610
ratzinger as explanation for the nature

3164
02:14:06,420 --> 02:14:11,280
of time and then address the concept of

3165
02:14:08,610 --> 02:14:13,470
beauty in the eye of the beholder with

3166
02:14:11,280 --> 02:14:17,780
specific reference to the body

3167
02:14:13,470 --> 02:14:17,780
positivity movement how

3168
02:14:19,340 --> 02:14:22,420
sheesh misses

3169
02:14:56,489 --> 02:15:07,860
no I don't think I can I think I think I

3170
02:15:08,670 --> 02:15:18,489
think that's ha ha ha I think I think

3171
02:15:15,699 --> 02:15:21,610
that you you tangled together so many

3172
02:15:18,489 --> 02:15:23,380
things and this is also a tangle of

3173
02:15:21,610 --> 02:15:26,710
things not that that's a criticism that

3174
02:15:23,380 --> 02:15:29,050
I can't pull them all together with

3175
02:15:26,710 --> 02:15:32,290
sufficient rapidity not to bore the

3176
02:15:29,050 --> 02:15:40,060
audience to death so I'm gonna I'm gonna

3177
02:15:32,290 --> 02:15:43,360
wait I'm gonna wait ok dr. Peterson I'm

3178
02:15:40,060 --> 02:15:46,989
fascinated by the idea of faith what

3179
02:15:43,360 --> 02:15:50,800
faith means Jacob listens to a voice and

3180
02:15:46,989 --> 02:15:55,690
believes it he probably heard other

3181
02:15:50,800 --> 02:15:58,300
voices why did he believe this one why

3182
02:15:55,690 --> 02:16:03,040
what there must have been an a priori

3183
02:15:58,300 --> 02:16:06,010
sort of functional necessity for him to

3184
02:16:03,040 --> 02:16:08,020
believe the voice that told him one

3185
02:16:06,010 --> 02:16:09,850
thing or another and and I think that

3186
02:16:08,020 --> 02:16:11,100
that's a string that runs through the

3187
02:16:09,850 --> 02:16:14,680
Bible and then through the New Testament

3188
02:16:11,100 --> 02:16:16,989
we are expected as well I confess I'm a

3189
02:16:14,680 --> 02:16:21,760
Christian I'm I act like I believe God

3190
02:16:16,989 --> 02:16:24,280
is real and and so there is this call of

3191
02:16:21,760 --> 02:16:27,310
faith and also the in in every hero's

3192
02:16:24,280 --> 02:16:30,489
story we we see now there is always a

3193
02:16:27,310 --> 02:16:33,429
moment in that story where the hero must

3194
02:16:30,489 --> 02:16:35,080
believe something beyond the evidence

3195
02:16:33,429 --> 02:16:37,090
that is before them which is to say they

3196
02:16:35,080 --> 02:16:38,469
must take a leap of faith so I'm

3197
02:16:37,090 --> 02:16:40,240
wondering if you can just kind of unpack

3198
02:16:38,469 --> 02:16:42,849
that experience of faith and the

3199
02:16:40,240 --> 02:16:44,650
understanding of how a human being makes

3200
02:16:42,849 --> 02:16:46,929
the choice to believe one thing or

3201
02:16:44,650 --> 02:16:50,920
another god that's a great question I

3202
02:16:46,929 --> 02:16:54,160
mean uh is this still on

3203
02:16:50,920 --> 02:16:57,969
is this still working okay okay okay

3204
02:16:54,160 --> 02:16:59,860
good um I don't I don't precisely know

3205
02:16:57,969 --> 02:17:02,139
the answer that it's it's a very

3206
02:16:59,860 --> 02:17:03,910
peculiar thing because we think many

3207
02:17:02,139 --> 02:17:07,210
things or you could say many voices

3208
02:17:03,910 --> 02:17:09,160
appear in our minds because when

3209
02:17:07,210 --> 02:17:10,990
Nietzsche took des cartes I think

3210
02:17:09,160 --> 02:17:12,370
therefore I am apart and he said well it

3211
02:17:10,990 --> 02:17:16,240
isn't so obvious that there's an AI

3212
02:17:12,370 --> 02:17:18,880
first of all that it's a unity like a no

3213
02:17:16,240 --> 02:17:20,650
unity transparent unto itself which of

3214
02:17:18,880 --> 02:17:22,929
course the psychoanalysts picked up in a

3215
02:17:20,650 --> 02:17:25,719
big way and then he wasn't sure that it

3216
02:17:22,929 --> 02:17:27,189
was the AI who thought in some causal

3217
02:17:25,719 --> 02:17:29,500
manner he said well no it's more like

3218
02:17:27,189 --> 02:17:32,200
thoughts it's something like thoughts

3219
02:17:29,500 --> 02:17:33,849
appear in the phenomenal field and maybe

3220
02:17:32,200 --> 02:17:35,290
you choose between them or maybe they

3221
02:17:33,849 --> 02:17:37,120
possess you like there's lots of other

3222
02:17:35,290 --> 02:17:39,729
ways of thinking about it it isn't

3223
02:17:37,120 --> 02:17:42,300
exactly obvious to me why we choose to

3224
02:17:39,729 --> 02:17:47,019
take one pathway rather than another

3225
02:17:42,300 --> 02:17:48,910
when so many of them offer themselves to

3226
02:17:47,019 --> 02:17:52,179
us you know people tend to talk about

3227
02:17:48,910 --> 02:18:01,570
that as something like conscience right

3228
02:17:52,179 --> 02:18:03,960
and now maybe it's that it's got to have

3229
02:18:01,570 --> 02:18:06,490
something to do I think

3230
02:18:03,960 --> 02:18:09,370
it's an endless regress because you can

3231
02:18:06,490 --> 02:18:11,860
always ask why the why any assumption

3232
02:18:09,370 --> 02:18:13,960
became primary but I'll put that aside

3233
02:18:11,860 --> 02:18:17,979
for a moment it seems to me to have

3234
02:18:13,960 --> 02:18:21,490
something to do with your aims you know

3235
02:18:17,979 --> 02:18:24,160
that you're more likely to listen to a

3236
02:18:21,490 --> 02:18:27,040
voice that is in keeping with your most

3237
02:18:24,160 --> 02:18:28,719
fundamental aims and then the question

3238
02:18:27,040 --> 02:18:30,550
is where do your most fundamental aims

3239
02:18:28,719 --> 02:18:32,050
come from and from what I've been able

3240
02:18:30,550 --> 02:18:34,990
to determine and I'll speak

3241
02:18:32,050 --> 02:18:37,780
psychologically again is that to begin

3242
02:18:34,990 --> 02:18:40,510
with you're a concatenation of rather

3243
02:18:37,780 --> 02:18:43,420
primitive sub personalities hungry ones

3244
02:18:40,510 --> 02:18:44,860
tired one's upset ones laughing one so

3245
02:18:43,420 --> 02:18:46,630
you can see that in babies you know they

3246
02:18:44,860 --> 02:18:51,160
cycle through those states very rapidly

3247
02:18:46,630 --> 02:18:53,830
there's a infantile unity above all that

3248
02:18:51,160 --> 02:18:56,679
but it doesn't have control right and so

3249
02:18:53,830 --> 02:18:58,740
then the developing individual has to

3250
02:18:56,679 --> 02:19:01,330
figure out how to integrate those

3251
02:18:58,740 --> 02:19:03,780
primitive sub personalities into a

3252
02:19:01,330 --> 02:19:05,730
unified personality

3253
02:19:03,780 --> 02:19:09,260
at the same time they integrate the

3254
02:19:05,730 --> 02:19:13,710
unified personality into a social unity

3255
02:19:09,260 --> 02:19:16,440
so it's partly individual integration

3256
02:19:13,710 --> 02:19:18,630
but it's fed by social forces I mean

3257
02:19:16,440 --> 02:19:21,450
even when you watch a an infant

3258
02:19:18,630 --> 02:19:23,160
breastfeed its established a

3259
02:19:21,450 --> 02:19:25,260
relationship with its mother and there's

3260
02:19:23,160 --> 02:19:28,530
a reciprocity that's already at play

3261
02:19:25,260 --> 02:19:30,900
there so then that underlying

3262
02:19:28,530 --> 02:19:33,420
multiplicity starts to form itself into

3263
02:19:30,900 --> 02:19:36,000
a unity and then the question and I

3264
02:19:33,420 --> 02:19:38,340
would say that's something like that's

3265
02:19:36,000 --> 02:19:41,639
something like the emergence of the the

3266
02:19:38,340 --> 02:19:43,530
individual out of out of the the Titans

3267
02:19:41,639 --> 02:19:45,809
that's a reasonable way of thinking

3268
02:19:43,530 --> 02:19:48,480
about it like a sovereign out of the

3269
02:19:45,809 --> 02:19:50,700
Titans it's something like that but then

3270
02:19:48,480 --> 02:19:53,820
there's another division which seems to

3271
02:19:50,700 --> 02:19:56,160
me to paralyse parallel the the Cain and

3272
02:19:53,820 --> 02:19:57,900
Abel division it's that that integration

3273
02:19:56,160 --> 02:19:59,580
can be oriented towards something that's

3274
02:19:57,900 --> 02:20:01,790
positive but it can also be oriented

3275
02:19:59,580 --> 02:20:04,620
towards something that's negative and

3276
02:20:01,790 --> 02:20:07,050
that's the split of the world into good

3277
02:20:04,620 --> 02:20:08,970
and evil I think and then it looks like

3278
02:20:07,050 --> 02:20:10,800
you're navigating between those and I

3279
02:20:08,970 --> 02:20:12,860
can only account for that with something

3280
02:20:10,800 --> 02:20:16,440
like choice like I think the free choice

3281
02:20:12,860 --> 02:20:19,050
even though I don't understand it I'm

3282
02:20:16,440 --> 02:20:21,150
unwilling to deny the existence of free

3283
02:20:19,050 --> 02:20:24,300
choice merely because I don't understand

3284
02:20:21,150 --> 02:20:26,370
it because it looks to me like that's

3285
02:20:24,300 --> 02:20:29,190
how people act that's how they expect to

3286
02:20:26,370 --> 02:20:31,200
be treated and that societies who that

3287
02:20:29,190 --> 02:20:32,760
that structure themselves in accordance

3288
02:20:31,200 --> 02:20:35,520
with the idea that people have free

3289
02:20:32,760 --> 02:20:37,110
choice actually work now that doesn't

3290
02:20:35,520 --> 02:20:38,220
prove that there's free choice but

3291
02:20:37,110 --> 02:20:41,280
people have been arguing about that

3292
02:20:38,220 --> 02:20:43,500
forever so but it looks to me so those

3293
02:20:41,280 --> 02:20:45,710
are two possible means of integration

3294
02:20:43,500 --> 02:20:48,830
and then I think what you're doing is

3295
02:20:45,710 --> 02:20:51,600
feeding one or the other constantly and

3296
02:20:48,830 --> 02:20:54,300
I think you probably choose which one to

3297
02:20:51,600 --> 02:20:56,670
feed I think that's and I mean that's

3298
02:20:54,300 --> 02:20:59,970
how it feels that way to me as well like

3299
02:20:56,670 --> 02:21:02,250
when I look at my own you know maybe

3300
02:20:59,970 --> 02:21:03,840
you're really aggravated with something

3301
02:21:02,250 --> 02:21:07,020
maybe you're aggravated with your wife

3302
02:21:03,840 --> 02:21:09,420
you know or your child or something like

3303
02:21:07,020 --> 02:21:12,330
that you know and you're feeling kind of

3304
02:21:09,420 --> 02:21:14,100
nasty and maybe even know that you're in

3305
02:21:12,330 --> 02:21:17,250
the wrong and an idea comes into your

3306
02:21:14,100 --> 02:21:18,990
head you think I could say that and

3307
02:21:17,250 --> 02:21:21,060
no you could say it and you know what it

3308
02:21:18,990 --> 02:21:24,420
would do but then you pause and you

3309
02:21:21,060 --> 02:21:26,130
think would that make it better or worse

3310
02:21:24,420 --> 02:21:28,410
and then maybe you go to hell with it

3311
02:21:26,130 --> 02:21:30,150
which is a quite the thing to say I've

3312
02:21:28,410 --> 02:21:30,600
got a little story about that in a

3313
02:21:30,150 --> 02:21:34,650
minute

3314
02:21:30,600 --> 02:21:36,930
and then you say it but you knew you

3315
02:21:34,650 --> 02:21:39,330
knew that you took the low road right

3316
02:21:36,930 --> 02:21:40,830
and you know it and then you're guilty

3317
02:21:39,330 --> 02:21:42,600
about that and defensive and that makes

3318
02:21:40,830 --> 02:21:44,190
the fight way worse because then there's

3319
02:21:42,600 --> 02:21:46,890
no damn way you're gonna admit that you

3320
02:21:44,190 --> 02:21:49,800
actually did that and so things do go to

3321
02:21:46,890 --> 02:21:53,250
hell and so so here's here's an ugly

3322
02:21:49,800 --> 02:21:55,950
little idea so that's that's that's

3323
02:21:53,250 --> 02:22:00,180
relevant to the question so imagine

3324
02:21:55,950 --> 02:22:02,460
you're playing around with cocaine now

3325
02:22:00,180 --> 02:22:04,020
I'm using cocaine because it's very

3326
02:22:02,460 --> 02:22:05,970
addictive but it's a very interesting

3327
02:22:04,020 --> 02:22:09,540
chemical because it's a dopaminergic

3328
02:22:05,970 --> 02:22:11,400
agonist and what what dopamine does is

3329
02:22:09,540 --> 02:22:13,850
two things it makes you feel like what

3330
02:22:11,400 --> 02:22:15,930
you're doing is worthwhile but it also

3331
02:22:13,850 --> 02:22:18,360
imagined that there's a bunch of neural

3332
02:22:15,930 --> 02:22:20,730
circuits that are active and then they

3333
02:22:18,360 --> 02:22:22,320
get a hit of dopamine or you do then

3334
02:22:20,730 --> 02:22:25,170
those neural circuits get a little bit

3335
02:22:22,320 --> 02:22:27,630
more powerful okay so it it has a

3336
02:22:25,170 --> 02:22:29,250
rewarding property which is that it

3337
02:22:27,630 --> 02:22:31,830
makes you feel like what you're doing is

3338
02:22:29,250 --> 02:22:34,080
important and it has a reinforcing

3339
02:22:31,830 --> 02:22:37,170
property which is it makes neural

3340
02:22:34,080 --> 02:22:40,740
circuits grow so now what that means is

3341
02:22:37,170 --> 02:22:44,640
that whatever you were doing just before

3342
02:22:40,740 --> 02:22:46,380
you took cocaine grows okay so now

3343
02:22:44,640 --> 02:22:48,000
imagine there's a bunch of different

3344
02:22:46,380 --> 02:22:50,310
things that you do just before you take

3345
02:22:48,000 --> 02:22:53,370
cocaine but there's a string of

3346
02:22:50,310 --> 02:22:55,110
decisions and at one decision point is

3347
02:22:53,370 --> 02:22:57,060
the same for all of those difference

3348
02:22:55,110 --> 02:22:58,830
occurrences and that decision point is

3349
02:22:57,060 --> 02:23:01,020
because you know you're in trouble and

3350
02:22:58,830 --> 02:23:02,270
that decision point is well to hell with

3351
02:23:01,020 --> 02:23:05,970
it

3352
02:23:02,270 --> 02:23:08,220
okay so then you think that each of the

3353
02:23:05,970 --> 02:23:09,630
200 times that you take cocaine even

3354
02:23:08,220 --> 02:23:12,060
though you do it in different places but

3355
02:23:09,630 --> 02:23:14,310
that one thought is there all the time

3356
02:23:12,060 --> 02:23:16,530
and that thing grows because you're

3357
02:23:14,310 --> 02:23:18,870
reinforcing it and it grows and it grows

3358
02:23:16,530 --> 02:23:21,060
and it grows and so now that's in you

3359
02:23:18,870 --> 02:23:23,910
let's that's part of you and it's the

3360
02:23:21,060 --> 02:23:26,760
thing that says to hell with it okay so

3361
02:23:23,910 --> 02:23:29,280
now and maybe that's not such a good

3362
02:23:26,760 --> 02:23:30,931
thing to grow inside your brain so then

3363
02:23:29,280 --> 02:23:32,730
you your idea

3364
02:23:30,931 --> 02:23:34,891
and they take you to a cocaine treatment

3365
02:23:32,730 --> 02:23:37,080
center and after a week you're no longer

3366
02:23:34,891 --> 02:23:39,091
physically physiologically addicted

3367
02:23:37,080 --> 02:23:42,091
you're not craving you don't have a

3368
02:23:39,091 --> 02:23:43,170
problem as long as you're there but then

3369
02:23:42,091 --> 02:23:46,170
they take you back to your normal

3370
02:23:43,170 --> 02:23:49,410
environment and you see like cocaine Joe

3371
02:23:46,170 --> 02:23:51,631
your friend and as soon as you see him

3372
02:23:49,410 --> 02:23:55,110
up that thing comes and bang you're back

3373
02:23:51,631 --> 02:23:57,210
on the you're back on the to hell with

3374
02:23:55,110 --> 02:24:00,080
the track and that's well you're in well

3375
02:23:57,210 --> 02:24:02,370
you're where you will end up - if you

3376
02:24:00,080 --> 02:24:06,210
reinforce that particular perspective

3377
02:24:02,370 --> 02:24:07,980
long enough so that's akin in a sense to

3378
02:24:06,210 --> 02:24:10,341
the this decision-making process you

3379
02:24:07,980 --> 02:24:12,721
know if you if you take the low road

3380
02:24:10,341 --> 02:24:17,030
then that wins and it gets a little

3381
02:24:12,721 --> 02:24:18,900
stronger because everything that wins

3382
02:24:17,030 --> 02:24:22,200
neurologically gets a little stronger

3383
02:24:18,900 --> 02:24:24,091
it's like a Darwinian competition so one

3384
02:24:22,200 --> 02:24:26,040
rule is don't practice what you don't

3385
02:24:24,091 --> 02:24:28,530
want to become because you really do

3386
02:24:26,040 --> 02:24:30,631
become that it builds it builds itself

3387
02:24:28,530 --> 02:24:32,311
right into your neural architecture and

3388
02:24:30,631 --> 02:24:33,480
that's one of the terrifying things

3389
02:24:32,311 --> 02:24:35,160
about addiction you know because you

3390
02:24:33,480 --> 02:24:37,891
think well it's kind of psychological

3391
02:24:35,160 --> 02:24:39,570
it's like yeah kind of it's also kind of

3392
02:24:37,891 --> 02:24:42,570
neuro physiological and you build a

3393
02:24:39,570 --> 02:24:44,580
one-eyed cocaine monster in your head if

3394
02:24:42,570 --> 02:24:51,320
you hit yourself enough with something

3395
02:24:44,580 --> 02:24:51,320
that reinforcing so yeah

3396
02:24:55,120 --> 02:25:04,780
last question I guess it's just a really

3397
02:25:00,221 --> 02:25:08,381
simple question then about long

3398
02:25:04,780 --> 02:25:10,120
suffering so when it one of the things

3399
02:25:08,381 --> 02:25:11,351
that was noticing from the stories of

3400
02:25:10,120 --> 02:25:13,990
Jacob and a lot of these biblical

3401
02:25:11,351 --> 02:25:16,650
narratives is you do have this

3402
02:25:13,990 --> 02:25:19,061
all-powerful God who is able to kind of

3403
02:25:16,650 --> 02:25:21,070
essentially be the hidden protagonist in

3404
02:25:19,061 --> 02:25:23,921
the narrative but then the funny thing

3405
02:25:21,070 --> 02:25:25,181
is that he's kind of revealing some of

3406
02:25:23,921 --> 02:25:28,811
his qualities throughout the course of

3407
02:25:25,181 --> 02:25:31,240
the story so you were talking about the

3408
02:25:28,811 --> 02:25:34,631
weird paradox of the fact that God

3409
02:25:31,240 --> 02:25:37,511
somehow allows Jacob Israel to win the

3410
02:25:34,631 --> 02:25:40,001
fight yeah

3411
02:25:37,511 --> 02:25:42,370
so my question is relating to pants EPs

3412
02:25:40,001 --> 02:25:43,931
thing about the rats that you told like

3413
02:25:42,370 --> 02:25:45,311
three or four times and the number of

3414
02:25:43,931 --> 02:25:46,841
occasions I saw one even more recent

3415
02:25:45,311 --> 02:25:48,580
videos you talked about it where the

3416
02:25:46,841 --> 02:25:50,410
bigger rat lets the smaller rat win

3417
02:25:48,580 --> 02:25:52,480
because then the other the smaller rat

3418
02:25:50,410 --> 02:25:55,990
won't engage in the game so the question

3419
02:25:52,480 --> 02:25:58,751
is is twofold for me one is God allowing

3420
02:25:55,990 --> 02:26:01,211
humanity to win periodically so that's

3421
02:25:58,751 --> 02:26:03,881
to allow us to actually engage in the

3422
02:26:01,211 --> 02:26:06,431
dialogue through these stories and to is

3423
02:26:03,881 --> 02:26:08,351
it a much more primitive version of the

3424
02:26:06,431 --> 02:26:10,751
virtue of humility which you wouldn't

3425
02:26:08,351 --> 02:26:15,431
normally characterize of an Amana path

3426
02:26:10,751 --> 02:26:17,830
of anonymity omnipotent deity well those

3427
02:26:15,431 --> 02:26:19,541
are excellent questions that's I really

3428
02:26:17,830 --> 02:26:23,771
like the second one in particular that

3429
02:26:19,541 --> 02:26:25,601
that that God's decision to allow human

3430
02:26:23,771 --> 02:26:27,730
victory from time to time is actually a

3431
02:26:25,601 --> 02:26:30,610
manifestation of something approximating

3432
02:26:27,730 --> 02:26:32,771
humility or at least mercy but humility

3433
02:26:30,610 --> 02:26:36,041
is an interesting take on it well it's

3434
02:26:32,771 --> 02:26:38,681
also connected to Paul's image of how

3435
02:26:36,041 --> 02:26:41,591
Christ handed him hands himself over and

3436
02:26:38,681 --> 02:26:43,841
allows himself to be defeated by men and

3437
02:26:41,591 --> 02:26:46,931
therefore conquers sin which is man's

3438
02:26:43,841 --> 02:26:49,211
enemy it's a weird it's the same paradox

3439
02:26:46,931 --> 02:26:52,771
where God enters into that dynamic with

3440
02:26:49,211 --> 02:26:56,681
people and loses and willingly loses

3441
02:26:52,771 --> 02:26:58,091
yeah well that's a okay so the first

3442
02:26:56,681 --> 02:27:01,440
thing I would say is that that's a

3443
02:26:58,091 --> 02:27:05,381
really interesting analogy I I

3444
02:27:01,440 --> 02:27:08,320
I can't it's complicated enough question

3445
02:27:05,381 --> 02:27:08,949
so that I can't go be I don't think I

3446
02:27:08,320 --> 02:27:10,779
can go be

3447
02:27:08,949 --> 02:27:12,189
the question actually because it's so

3448
02:27:10,779 --> 02:27:13,959
complicated that I don't think I can

3449
02:27:12,189 --> 02:27:16,329
formulate it any better than you already

3450
02:27:13,959 --> 02:27:18,069
did like it's an interesting string of

3451
02:27:16,329 --> 02:27:21,579
ideas I'd have to play with it a while

3452
02:27:18,069 --> 02:27:25,419
to see it does shed an interesting light

3453
02:27:21,579 --> 02:27:27,430
on why God is amenable to negotiation in

3454
02:27:25,419 --> 02:27:29,169
the Old Testament which is really a

3455
02:27:27,430 --> 02:27:31,060
strange as you pointed out it's really a

3456
02:27:29,169 --> 02:27:33,009
strange thing it's like this is

3457
02:27:31,060 --> 02:27:35,499
omnipotent God who obviously can do

3458
02:27:33,009 --> 02:27:37,869
whatever he wants and yet he allow he

3459
02:27:35,499 --> 02:27:40,270
can be bargained with and that also

3460
02:27:37,869 --> 02:27:42,279
opens up the question of why like your

3461
02:27:40,270 --> 02:27:44,199
hypothesis is well if you don't let the

3462
02:27:42,279 --> 02:27:46,749
little rat win now and then then they

3463
02:27:44,199 --> 02:27:48,279
get dejected and quit playing and that's

3464
02:27:46,749 --> 02:27:50,140
I mean that's that's a pretty good

3465
02:27:48,279 --> 02:27:52,600
observation if people don't get to win

3466
02:27:50,140 --> 02:27:55,119
now and then you know they that's kind

3467
02:27:52,600 --> 02:27:56,709
of what happens to Cain God says well

3468
02:27:55,119 --> 02:28:03,989
you not playing a straight game that's

3469
02:27:56,709 --> 02:28:03,989
why you're not winning but I don't know

3470
02:28:05,369 --> 02:28:09,009
there's an intimation in the Old

3471
02:28:07,719 --> 02:28:10,899
Testament and I think it's more

3472
02:28:09,009 --> 02:28:13,209
developed in the New Testament maybe not

3473
02:28:10,899 --> 02:28:17,879
that the straighter the game you play

3474
02:28:13,209 --> 02:28:20,469
the more likely you are to win and so

3475
02:28:17,879 --> 02:28:22,959
maybe part of the reason that God lets

3476
02:28:20,469 --> 02:28:24,999
Abraham bargain and and even Jacob is

3477
02:28:22,959 --> 02:28:27,789
because they've started to play very

3478
02:28:24,999 --> 02:28:29,409
straight games and so maybe you do win

3479
02:28:27,789 --> 02:28:32,199
in your wrestling with God if you play a

3480
02:28:29,409 --> 02:28:34,029
straight game I mean I think that's I

3481
02:28:32,199 --> 02:28:35,399
actually think that's I think the reason

3482
02:28:34,029 --> 02:28:38,199
that's true is because that's actually

3483
02:28:35,399 --> 02:28:40,029
why we would define it as a straight

3484
02:28:38,199 --> 02:28:42,549
game now then we could speak

3485
02:28:40,029 --> 02:28:45,249
psychologically again I think that what

3486
02:28:42,549 --> 02:28:47,979
we've come to recognize as a straight

3487
02:28:45,249 --> 02:28:51,039
game is the game that in the broadest

3488
02:28:47,979 --> 02:28:53,799
number of situations across the widest

3489
02:28:51,039 --> 02:28:55,749
range of time spans is most likely to

3490
02:28:53,799 --> 02:28:57,640
produce a positive outcome and that's

3491
02:28:55,749 --> 02:28:59,259
that's actually the grounds for our

3492
02:28:57,640 --> 02:29:01,839
sense of ethics that it's really

3493
02:28:59,259 --> 02:29:03,159
practical not to belabor it too much

3494
02:29:01,839 --> 02:29:04,629
because there was there was an

3495
02:29:03,159 --> 02:29:07,119
interesting insight from Chesterton's

3496
02:29:04,629 --> 02:29:10,289
the man who was Thursday where God sets

3497
02:29:07,119 --> 02:29:15,039
himself up as the benevolent antagonist

3498
02:29:10,289 --> 02:29:17,199
so as to accelerate the game yeah well I

3499
02:29:15,039 --> 02:29:20,499
think that's a really interesting idea I

3500
02:29:17,199 --> 02:29:22,630
mean there is there is hints I would say

3501
02:29:20,499 --> 02:29:26,380
throughout the biblical story

3502
02:29:22,630 --> 02:29:28,840
that the reason that God tolerates Satan

3503
02:29:26,380 --> 02:29:32,710
let's say is because without an

3504
02:29:28,840 --> 02:29:34,510
adversary you're soft and that's I mean

3505
02:29:32,710 --> 02:29:37,180
that's tied in with the notion that life

3506
02:29:34,510 --> 02:29:38,800
is something like a moral struggle you

3507
02:29:37,180 --> 02:29:42,100
know that that's the fundamental essence

3508
02:29:38,800 --> 02:29:44,220
of being a moral struggle now it I think

3509
02:29:42,100 --> 02:29:47,020
that that's phenomenologically a

3510
02:29:44,220 --> 02:29:48,520
reasonable observation maybe it's maybe

3511
02:29:47,020 --> 02:29:51,280
other people don't experience it that

3512
02:29:48,520 --> 02:29:53,710
way but it seems to me like within my

3513
02:29:51,280 --> 02:29:55,000
own experience that that's accurate now

3514
02:29:53,710 --> 02:29:56,620
I don't know what again I don't know

3515
02:29:55,000 --> 02:29:59,439
what that says about the fundamental

3516
02:29:56,620 --> 02:30:02,200
nature of reality but I had a vision at

3517
02:29:59,439 --> 02:30:07,570
one point that I was in a ring with

3518
02:30:02,200 --> 02:30:11,800
Satan actually believe it or not and it

3519
02:30:07,570 --> 02:30:15,010
was like a Roman Colosseum and you know

3520
02:30:11,800 --> 02:30:19,479
I was rather upset to find myself there

3521
02:30:15,010 --> 02:30:22,120
but I won and I asked God afterwards why

3522
02:30:19,479 --> 02:30:25,750
he would do such a thing and his answer

3523
02:30:22,120 --> 02:30:27,729
was he knew I could win and that's

3524
02:30:25,750 --> 02:30:29,050
interesting you know because like I

3525
02:30:27,729 --> 02:30:30,610
don't know what to make of that believe

3526
02:30:29,050 --> 02:30:34,660
me I have no idea what to make of that

3527
02:30:30,610 --> 02:30:38,140
but the idea was that if you're trying

3528
02:30:34,660 --> 02:30:39,340
to encourage someone rather than protect

3529
02:30:38,140 --> 02:30:41,350
them because those are really different

3530
02:30:39,340 --> 02:30:43,149
things right to protect someone isn't to

3531
02:30:41,350 --> 02:30:45,460
make them strong to encourage them is to

3532
02:30:43,149 --> 02:30:51,250
make them strong then you set them a

3533
02:30:45,460 --> 02:30:54,700
series of challenges right right at the

3534
02:30:51,250 --> 02:30:56,020
point where they may win and maybe you

3535
02:30:54,700 --> 02:30:58,540
could make a case that that's what you

3536
02:30:56,020 --> 02:31:00,700
do if you really care for someone now I

3537
02:30:58,540 --> 02:31:03,580
know that that's it I'm not saying that

3538
02:31:00,700 --> 02:31:06,729
that interpretation is correct I'm not

3539
02:31:03,580 --> 02:31:08,620
but but there's something mean you

3540
02:31:06,729 --> 02:31:10,450
definitely with your children you know

3541
02:31:08,620 --> 02:31:14,740
when you're wrestling with them say when

3542
02:31:10,450 --> 02:31:17,189
you're playing with them you use you

3543
02:31:14,740 --> 02:31:19,720
push them to the limit of their ability

3544
02:31:17,189 --> 02:31:27,899
because otherwise they don't transcend

3545
02:31:19,720 --> 02:31:27,899
their current abilities so yep

3546
02:31:29,420 --> 02:31:38,350
[Music]

3547
02:31:38,560 --> 02:31:45,560
so we'll see some of you perhaps most of

3548
02:31:42,560 --> 02:31:48,410
you in December and I think we'll finish

3549
02:31:45,560 --> 02:31:50,270
off Genesis at that point and then in

3550
02:31:48,410 --> 02:31:53,720
the new year probably not till the

3551
02:31:50,270 --> 02:31:55,069
spring I'll start with exodus which I'm

3552
02:31:53,720 --> 02:31:57,050
really looking forward to because I

3553
02:31:55,069 --> 02:32:00,080
really like the Exodus story it's an

3554
02:31:57,050 --> 02:32:01,880
amazing story and unbelievably deep note

3555
02:32:00,080 --> 02:32:04,489
well the ones we've covered so far being

3556
02:32:01,880 --> 02:32:05,989
you know pretty good as well but so

3557
02:32:04,489 --> 02:32:09,399
thank you all for coming and we'll

3558
02:32:05,989 --> 02:32:09,399
perhaps see you in about a month
