2
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:22,140
three difficult stories tonight and

3
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:24,060
hopefully my plan is to get through all

4
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:29,670
three of them so we'll see how that goes

5
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:32,759
so we're going to talk about the story

6
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:36,690
of sodom and gomorrah and then the story

7
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:40,350
of the sacrifice of Isaac which is an

8
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:42,149
extremely complicated complicated story

9
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:43,379
and so we'll try to make some headway

10
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:45,539
with that the story of Sodom and

11
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:48,020
Gomorrah is plenty complicated - all

12
00:00:45,539 --> 00:00:51,899
right so what we established last week

13
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:54,199
at least in part was this idea that the

14
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:57,570
Abrahamic narratives are set up as

15
00:00:54,199 --> 00:01:01,649
punctuated epochs I suppose in Abraham's

16
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:04,019
life and we were hypothesizing that you

17
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:05,850
know you set out a goal for yourself in

18
00:01:04,019 --> 00:01:09,000
your life it's like a stage in your life

19
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:11,310
you might say that and then when you run

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,369
that goal to its end when that stage

21
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:17,700
comes to an end then you have to regroup

22
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:20,880
and orient yourself once again and I was

23
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:25,740
making the case that that's a good time

24
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:27,780
to make necessary sacrifices you know

25
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:32,100
and part of that because as you move

26
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:36,000
through your life you have to shed that

27
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:38,659
which is no longer necessary and because

28
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,360
otherwise it accretes around you and

29
00:01:38,659 --> 00:01:46,259
holds you down and you perish sooner

30
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:48,479
than you should and I think that's in

31
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:50,149
large part because if you don't dispense

32
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,920
with your life as you move through it

33
00:01:50,149 --> 00:01:55,079
then the stress of all that undone

34
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:57,719
business and all those unmade decisions

35
00:01:55,079 --> 00:02:00,290
turns into a kind of chaos around you

36
00:01:57,719 --> 00:02:02,520
and that chaos puts you in a state of

37
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:05,100
psychophysiological emergency

38
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:09,690
preparedness chronically and that just

39
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:11,640
ages you and so it's necessary in some

40
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,350
sense to stay light on your feet and

41
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:17,850
also I think

42
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:21,150
to renew your commitment to your aim

43
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:23,580
upward and I believe that that's what

44
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:26,040
the sacrificial routines in the

45
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:27,960
Abrahamic stories dramatized I said

46
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:32,810
already that these things are often

47
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:36,110
first portrayed very dramatically and

48
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:38,520
concretely before they become

49
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:40,110
psychologists and we'll see because one

50
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,360
of the things that happens tonight as

51
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:45,000
well in these stories is that when God

52
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,130
makes his covenant with Abraham this is

53
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,500
the next part of the story it's also

54
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:52,440
when the idea of circumcision is

55
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:54,210
introduced into ancient Hebrew culture

56
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,610
and others every bit of evidence that

57
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:59,970
other cultures were utilizing

58
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:03,090
circumcision beforehand so it wasn't

59
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:05,730
necessarily a novel invention of the

60
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:09,330
Abrahamic people but I see its

61
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:11,990
introduction as a step on the road to

62
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:14,790
the psychologize ation of the idea of

63
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:18,060
sacrifice right first of all it's giving

64
00:03:14,790 --> 00:03:21,060
up something concrete and then second

65
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:23,850
it's signified by the sacrifice of a

66
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:25,530
part of the body instead of for the sake

67
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:27,090
of the whole it's something like that

68
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:28,500
it's dramatizing the idea that you have

69
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:30,960
to give up a part of yourself for the

70
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,460
sake of the whole and eventually well by

71
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:34,890
modern times that becomes virtually

72
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:39,090
completely psycho psychological and it's

73
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:41,160
in its essence in that we all understand

74
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:42,980
perhaps not as well as we should but at

75
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:47,100
least well enough to explain it that

76
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:50,940
it's necessary to make sacrifices to

77
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:53,190
move ahead in life one of the themes

78
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:55,500
that I'd like to explore tonight in

79
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:58,530
relationship especially to the sacrifice

80
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:02,130
of Isaac is that you know once humanity

81
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:03,960
had established the idea that sacrifice

82
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:06,750
was necessary to move ahead which is

83
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:09,390
really it's a discovery of incalculable

84
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:10,860
magnitude right the idea that the idea

85
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:13,140
that you can give up something in the

86
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:15,780
present and that will in some sense

87
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:17,730
ensure a better future is an

88
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:19,380
unbelievable achievement it's equivalent

89
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:20,880
to the discovery of the future it's

90
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:23,310
equivalent to the discovery of the

91
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:26,280
utility of work like its importance

92
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:27,240
can't be overstated okay so it took a

93
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,919
long time for people

94
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,569
figure this out animals haven't figured

95
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:32,460
it out at all right we've figured it out

96
00:04:30,569 --> 00:04:34,229
and it's hard it's hard for people to

97
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:37,139
make sacrifices because of course the

98
00:04:34,229 --> 00:04:38,669
present has a major grip on you as it

99
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:39,240
should because in some way you live in

100
00:04:38,669 --> 00:04:42,599
the present

101
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:44,520
so anyways there's the twin problem of

102
00:04:42,599 --> 00:04:45,690
getting the whole idea of sacrifice up

103
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:47,039
and running and then figuring out

104
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:48,960
exactly what it means but there's a

105
00:04:47,039 --> 00:04:52,590
problem that branches off that too or a

106
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:54,810
two-fold problem so the hypothesis is

107
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:58,139
that sacrifice is necessary to ensure

108
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:59,639
the that the future is safe and secure

109
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:02,310
and productive and positive and all of

110
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:04,020
those things ok so then then a question

111
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:07,020
immediate two questions immediately rise

112
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:08,970
from that right one is well what's the

113
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:10,289
proper sacrifice now we already talked

114
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:11,729
about that a little bit with regards to

115
00:05:10,289 --> 00:05:14,310
Cain and Abel and one of the things we

116
00:05:11,729 --> 00:05:16,949
saw was that Cain's sacrifice whatever

117
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:18,509
it was was wrong and Abel's was right

118
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:20,310
Noah's seemed to be right

119
00:05:18,509 --> 00:05:22,650
Abraham seems to be right there is

120
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:23,819
something about a sacrifice that can be

121
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:25,949
correct there's something about a

122
00:05:23,819 --> 00:05:28,050
sacrifice that can be incorrect the

123
00:05:25,949 --> 00:05:30,810
question is what would be the maximally

124
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:32,940
correct sacrifice so because that's an

125
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:34,620
obvious question to arise from the mere

126
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:36,449
observation that sacrifice is necessary

127
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:39,270
okay if you're going to sacrifice and

128
00:05:36,449 --> 00:05:40,949
it's necessary well how is it that you

129
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:42,870
would behave if you were going to do it

130
00:05:40,949 --> 00:05:45,150
really well if you're going to do it

131
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:47,520
perfectly okay so that's question number

132
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:50,820
one and then question number two might

133
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:53,639
be well if the future can be better

134
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:55,770
because of the sacrifice and sacrifices

135
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:59,039
can vary in quality then how much better

136
00:05:55,770 --> 00:06:00,599
could this set the future be if your

137
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,729
sacrifice was of the highest quality

138
00:06:00,599 --> 00:06:04,229
right there's a limit issue there and it

139
00:06:02,729 --> 00:06:05,580
the limit is something like well how

140
00:06:04,229 --> 00:06:07,650
good could your life be if you really

141
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:09,930
got your act together and you gave up

142
00:06:07,650 --> 00:06:12,120
all the things that we're impeding you

143
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:14,550
in your movement forward if you did that

144
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:16,949
forthrightly and and and with with

145
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:18,900
integrity and with seriousness with with

146
00:06:16,949 --> 00:06:21,569
dead seriousness and you tried to set

147
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:24,000
your life right what is the upper limits

148
00:06:21,569 --> 00:06:26,969
with regards to how your life might lay

149
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,340
itself out and I would say well we don't

150
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:32,039
know the answer to that but I think that

151
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:33,930
like the idea of something like the City

152
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:35,310
of God or the kingdom of God on earth or

153
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:39,000
the re-establishment of paradise

154
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:41,190
something like that is the answer of the

155
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,140
imagination to the court

156
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:46,290
how good could the future be if

157
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:48,360
sacrifice was optimized and those are

158
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:50,160
archetypal questions right an archetypal

159
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,680
question is a question that everyone

160
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,420
asks whether they know it or not because

161
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:56,310
sometimes you can act out a question an

162
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:58,170
archetypical estin is a question that

163
00:06:56,310 --> 00:07:00,630
everyone asks and an archetypal answer

164
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:04,200
is the answer that can't be made any

165
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:05,490
better to that question so I can give

166
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:07,860
you an example of that the reason that

167
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:09,630
Christ's passion is an archetypal story

168
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:12,030
is because it's a kind of limit right

169
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:14,070
it's the worst possible set of things

170
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:17,250
that can happen to the best possible

171
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:19,560
person so it's a story that constitutes

172
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:21,570
a limit it has nothing to do with the

173
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,950
factual reality of the story that's a

174
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:24,990
completely independent issue I'm

175
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:26,670
speaking about this psychologically is

176
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:28,860
that certain stories can exhaust

177
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:31,320
themselves in a perfect form and that

178
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:33,390
would be the archetypal form so that's

179
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:35,460
the territory that we're going to wander

180
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:38,400
around in a little bit today and we'll

181
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:40,110
use the stories as anchors in thinking a

182
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,600
lot about the Sodom and Gomorrah story

183
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:44,580
because it has its classically

184
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:46,620
associated with a biblical injunction

185
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:48,360
against homosexuality and that's often

186
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:50,580
how it's read I would say in particular

187
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:51,840
by the more fundamentalist end of the

188
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:53,700
Christian spectrum and I've thought

189
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,560
about that a lot because it's pretty

190
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:57,120
damn clear that the story of Sodom and

191
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:59,190
Gomorrah has something to do with sexual

192
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,480
and propriety but I've really come to

193
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:03,270
the conclusion and it's very little to

194
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:06,300
do with homosexuality so we'll see how

195
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:07,920
that interpretation prevails as we walk

196
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:10,590
through this tonight okay so we'll start

197
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:13,320
with a bit of a recap from last week so

198
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:15,900
Abraham's had had his last adventure and

199
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:17,550
he's 90 years old ninety nine years old

200
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,800
actually the Lord appeared to Abram and

201
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:22,050
said unto him I am the Almighty God walk

202
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:25,110
before me and be thou perfect well

203
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:28,620
that's quite the command now

204
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:33,540
Alexander McLaren who we talked about

205
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:36,090
before it elaborated upon this slightly

206
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:38,190
and this is what he had to say it's this

207
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:39,900
is not precisely walking with God the

208
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:42,210
idea of walking before God it is rather

209
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:44,040
that of an act of life spent in

210
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:45,900
continual consciousness of being naked

211
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:48,720
and opened before the eyes of him to

212
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:50,820
whom we have to give an account okay so

213
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,220
that's that's an idea that's in keeping

214
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:54,440
with the notion that what we're seeing

215
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:59,150
an Abrahamic story

216
00:08:54,440 --> 00:09:01,700
is the call to adventure of the of man

217
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:03,590
of the typical person right because your

218
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:04,790
life in some sense is an adventure and I

219
00:09:03,590 --> 00:09:07,070
suppose the reason for that is that

220
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:09,200
you're confronted by things that you

221
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:11,330
cannot understand that you have not yet

222
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:13,850
mastered there's a heavy price to be

223
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:15,890
paid if you fail to conduct yourself

224
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:18,290
appropriately and there's a large reward

225
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:20,750
to be gained if you conduct yourself

226
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:23,330
properly and so that pretty much defines

227
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:24,710
an adventure story and God calls to

228
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:26,060
Abraham and tells him to move out into

229
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:28,640
the world to leave what he's familiar

230
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:32,210
with to go into the strange lands of

231
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:35,360
famine and tyranny and to find his place

232
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:38,540
and that works out quite nicely for

233
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:40,010
Abraham and so what that also means is

234
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:42,410
that because Abraham is doing that

235
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:44,900
consciously at least according to this

236
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:47,720
interpretation that he's not naive in

237
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:49,790
his in his determination to move forward

238
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,440
you know I mean I've dealt with lots of

239
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:53,540
people who have anxiety disorders you

240
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,130
know and one thing about people who have

241
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:58,000
anxiety disorders is they are not

242
00:09:55,130 --> 00:10:00,530
mysterious to me I understand

243
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,870
it's no problem for me to understand why

244
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:04,400
people have anxiety disorders or why

245
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:06,830
they're depressed or why they have

246
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:08,720
substance use problems the mystery to me

247
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:11,570
is always why people don't have all of

248
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:13,400
those things at once because everybody

249
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:14,780
has a reason to be anxious in fact we

250
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,610
have the ultimate reason to be anxious

251
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:18,470
because we know that we're vulnerable

252
00:10:16,610 --> 00:10:20,840
and we know that we're going to die and

253
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:22,910
how you cannot be anxious under those

254
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:24,950
circumstances is a great mystery it's a

255
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:27,050
massive mystery and the same thing

256
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:29,180
applies with regards to depression and

257
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:30,560
then the same thing applies to some

258
00:10:29,180 --> 00:10:32,690
degree with regards to drug and alcohol

259
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:34,310
abuse because I said last week there's

260
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:36,290
plenty of reasons to drown your

261
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:37,970
consciousness in alcohol that's for sure

262
00:10:36,290 --> 00:10:41,270
we could refer to the aforementioned

263
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:43,880
anxiety depression not least and so and

264
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:45,620
the and the sorts of drugs that people

265
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:48,200
are prone to take our chemicals that

266
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:55,160
take the affective edge off the tragedy

267
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:59,630
of life so so back to back to the issue

268
00:10:55,160 --> 00:11:01,670
of fear being Abraham is self-conscious

269
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:03,320
that's what this commentary says but the

270
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:04,910
thing is as he moves forward despite

271
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:06,680
that he's self-conscious and he knows

272
00:11:04,910 --> 00:11:08,389
the danger but he moves forward despite

273
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:10,639
that and that's actually

274
00:11:08,389 --> 00:11:13,249
the appropriate response in the face of

275
00:11:10,639 --> 00:11:14,869
actual non naive understanding of what

276
00:11:13,249 --> 00:11:16,429
constitutes life like if you're naive

277
00:11:14,869 --> 00:11:18,259
and you move forward it's like well what

278
00:11:16,429 --> 00:11:19,970
the hell do you know you know there's no

279
00:11:18,259 --> 00:11:22,939
courage in naivety because you don't

280
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:24,350
know what there is to stop you you don't

281
00:11:22,939 --> 00:11:27,920
know what dangers you might apprehend

282
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:30,619
but to be aware of what it is that your

283
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:32,239
problem is so to be alert existentially

284
00:11:30,619 --> 00:11:33,860
let's say or to be fully self conscious

285
00:11:32,239 --> 00:11:35,689
means that you're perfectly aware of

286
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:37,850
your limitations and how you might be

287
00:11:35,689 --> 00:11:39,499
hurt and then to make the decision to

288
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:41,480
move forward into the unknown and the

289
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:43,489
land of the stranger anyways that's the

290
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:45,559
I would say that's one of the secrets to

291
00:11:43,489 --> 00:11:48,439
a good life and I can say that really

292
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:50,269
without fear of contradiction I would I

293
00:11:48,439 --> 00:11:52,129
would say because the clinical

294
00:11:50,269 --> 00:11:54,499
literature on this is very very very

295
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:56,720
clear what you do with people who are

296
00:11:54,499 --> 00:11:59,209
afraid and to some degree depressed but

297
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,799
certainly anxious is you lay out what

298
00:11:59,209 --> 00:12:02,899
what they're anxious about first of all

299
00:12:00,799 --> 00:12:04,879
in in detail what is it that you're

300
00:12:02,899 --> 00:12:07,809
afraid of what might happen and then you

301
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:10,040
decompose it into small problems

302
00:12:07,809 --> 00:12:12,290
hypothetically manageable problems and

303
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:13,699
then you have the person expose

304
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:15,919
themselves to this thing that they're

305
00:12:13,699 --> 00:12:17,569
afraid of and what happens isn't that

306
00:12:15,919 --> 00:12:20,089
they get less afraid that isn't what the

307
00:12:17,569 --> 00:12:21,980
clinical literature indicates exactly

308
00:12:20,089 --> 00:12:24,649
what happens instead is they get braver

309
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:26,209
and that's not the same thing right cuz

310
00:12:24,649 --> 00:12:27,589
if you get less afraid it's like well

311
00:12:26,209 --> 00:12:29,809
the world isn't just dangerous as I

312
00:12:27,589 --> 00:12:31,610
thought it was you know silly me if you

313
00:12:29,809 --> 00:12:33,019
get braver that's not what happens what

314
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:34,850
happens is the other world am world's

315
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:36,679
just as dangerous as I thought or maybe

316
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:38,540
it's even more dangerous than I thought

317
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:40,759
but it turns out that there's something

318
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:42,919
in me that responds to taking that on as

319
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:45,079
a voluntary challenge and grows and

320
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:46,220
thrives as a consequence and there's no

321
00:12:45,079 --> 00:12:48,019
doubt about this even the

322
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:53,509
psychophysiological findings are quite

323
00:12:48,019 --> 00:12:55,730
clear if you if you can if you impose a

324
00:12:53,509 --> 00:12:57,669
stressor on two groups of people and on

325
00:12:55,730 --> 00:13:00,379
one group the stressor is imposed

326
00:12:57,669 --> 00:13:03,139
involuntarily and on the other group the

327
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:04,519
stressor is picked up voluntarily the

328
00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:06,439
people who pick up the stress or

329
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:08,449
voluntary voluntarily use a whole

330
00:13:06,439 --> 00:13:10,369
different psychophysiological system to

331
00:13:08,449 --> 00:13:12,230
deal with it they use the system that's

332
00:13:10,369 --> 00:13:14,239
associated with approach and challenge

333
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:16,819
and not the system that's associated

334
00:13:14,239 --> 00:13:19,249
with defensive aggression and withdrawal

335
00:13:16,819 --> 00:13:20,990
and the system that is associated with

336
00:13:19,249 --> 00:13:21,600
challenges much more associated with

337
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:24,180
positive

338
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,730
and much less associated with negative

339
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:29,009
emotion it's also much less hard on you

340
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:31,290
because the the defensive posturing

341
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:33,029
system the prey animal system man when

342
00:13:31,290 --> 00:13:35,819
that thing kicks in it's all systems are

343
00:13:33,029 --> 00:13:37,649
go for you you know you're the gas is

344
00:13:35,819 --> 00:13:38,970
pushed down to the are the pedals pushed

345
00:13:37,649 --> 00:13:41,430
down to the metal and the brakes are on

346
00:13:38,970 --> 00:13:43,139
you're using future resources that you

347
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:44,819
could be storing for future time right

348
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:48,089
now in the present to ready yourself for

349
00:13:44,819 --> 00:13:50,220
emergency so there's there's there's

350
00:13:48,089 --> 00:13:51,839
nothing simple or trivial at all about

351
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:54,389
the idea of being called to move

352
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:56,459
forthrightly forward into the strange

353
00:13:54,389 --> 00:13:58,139
and the unknown and there's a real

354
00:13:56,459 --> 00:14:00,209
adventure that's associated with that

355
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:01,889
right so that's an exciting thing which

356
00:14:00,209 --> 00:14:04,050
is part of the reason why people travel

357
00:14:01,889 --> 00:14:05,880
and then also to see yourself as the

358
00:14:04,050 --> 00:14:08,130
sort of creature that can do that is

359
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:11,100
willing to do that on a habitual basis

360
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:14,009
is also the right kind of tonic for I

361
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:16,050
hate this word for your self-esteem you

362
00:14:14,009 --> 00:14:17,339
know because the self-esteem has nothing

363
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:19,860
to do with feeling good about yourself

364
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:22,110
as I already mentioned there isn't

365
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:23,880
necessarily reason why a priori you

366
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:26,459
should just feel good about yourself but

367
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:28,230
if you can view yourself acting in a

368
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:29,850
courageous and forthright manner and

369
00:14:28,230 --> 00:14:32,639
encountering the world and trying to

370
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:35,069
improve your lot and and and taking

371
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,300
risks you know in a non naive way well

372
00:14:35,069 --> 00:14:38,279
then you have something that you can

373
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:39,990
comfort yourself with at night when

374
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:42,959
you're wondering what the whole damn

375
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:45,740
point of is of your futile and miserable

376
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:48,540
life and so and that's necessary because

377
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:49,769
it's often the case that you wake up at

378
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:51,569
4:00 in the morning or at least

379
00:14:49,769 --> 00:14:52,860
sometimes the case that you wake up at

380
00:14:51,569 --> 00:14:54,689
4:00 in the morning when things haven't

381
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:56,189
been going that well and wonder just

382
00:14:54,689 --> 00:14:57,990
what the hell the point is of your

383
00:14:56,189 --> 00:15:00,540
futile and miserable life you have to

384
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:02,610
have something real to set against that

385
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:04,829
it can't be just rationalizations about

386
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:06,480
how you know you're a valuable person

387
00:15:04,829 --> 00:15:08,310
among others even though that's true

388
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,500
that's not good enough you need

389
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:13,050
something that's more realistic to set

390
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:15,329
it against that an observing courage in

391
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:17,670
yourself is definitely one of the things

392
00:15:15,329 --> 00:15:19,740
that that that can help you sleep

393
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:23,779
soundly at night when when things are

394
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:26,730
destabilized a little bit around you so

395
00:15:23,779 --> 00:15:29,100
back to the covenant God tells Abraham

396
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:31,410
me make my covenant between me and D and

397
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:33,300
will multiply the exceedingly and Abram

398
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:34,500
fell on his face and God talked with him

399
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:36,660
saying as

400
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,220
me behold my covenant my contract is

401
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:40,620
with thee and thou shalt be a father of

402
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:42,330
many nations neither shall thy name

403
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:44,730
anymore be called Abram but thy name

404
00:15:42,330 --> 00:15:47,430
shall be called Abraham for a father of

405
00:15:44,730 --> 00:15:49,290
many nations have I made thee an abram

406
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:51,630
means High father and Abraham father of

407
00:15:49,290 --> 00:15:54,540
a multitude and I'll make thee

408
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:57,270
exceedingly fruitful and I will make

409
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:59,580
nations of thee and Kings shall come out

410
00:15:57,270 --> 00:16:01,890
of thee and I will establish my covenant

411
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:04,020
between me and thee and thy seed after

412
00:16:01,890 --> 00:16:06,300
thee in their generations for an

413
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:08,460
everlasting covenant to be a God unto

414
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:09,870
thee and to thy seed after thee and I

415
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:11,640
will give unto thee and thy seed after

416
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:14,220
thee the land wherein thou art a

417
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:16,350
stranger all the land of canaan for an

418
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:19,110
everlasting possession and I will be

419
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:21,660
their God I love that line really the

420
00:16:19,110 --> 00:16:24,000
line about the land where you are a

421
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:25,650
stranger you know and everything that

422
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,210
happens in the Bible almost everything

423
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:29,120
that happens in these more archaic

424
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:30,780
stories in particular is laid out

425
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,150
geographically the metaphor is

426
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:35,520
Geographic so you move to a land that

427
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:37,200
you haven't yet occupied maybe that's

428
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:39,090
full of strangers and then the land is

429
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:41,070
what's granted to you but it's perfectly

430
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:42,270
reasonable to think about this from the

431
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:44,160
perspective from a more abstract

432
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:45,570
perspective it's much more relevant to

433
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:48,030
modern people with our incredibly

434
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:51,120
complex societies you know it's

435
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:52,650
definitely the case that if you go into

436
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,210
the land of the stranger which is

437
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:55,830
exactly what you do when you try out any

438
00:16:54,210 --> 00:16:57,990
new endeavor right when you start a new

439
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:59,130
job or when you start a new educational

440
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:01,170
enterprise or when you start a new

441
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:03,300
relationship doesn't matter you're out

442
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:05,610
there in unexplored territory like the

443
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:08,160
physical geography is the same but we

444
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:10,170
don't live in in the physics in the

445
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:11,940
spatial world only we live in the

446
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:14,550
temporal spatial world and what that

447
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:16,650
means is that the same place can be

448
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:18,780
different at a different time and maybe

449
00:17:16,650 --> 00:17:20,430
it can be completely different and so if

450
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:22,290
you're in your house but you have a new

451
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:24,330
person in your house while your house is

452
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:26,190
new for all intents and purpose because

453
00:17:24,330 --> 00:17:29,100
the territory surrounding that new

454
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:31,440
person is the territory of the foreigner

455
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:32,700
essentially and the same thing happens

456
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,810
to you when you start a new job and

457
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:35,610
you'll find that when you start a new

458
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:36,990
job especially if you stretched yourself

459
00:17:35,610 --> 00:17:39,510
a little bit beyond your zone of comfort

460
00:17:36,990 --> 00:17:41,700
that you very much feel like an imposter

461
00:17:39,510 --> 00:17:43,290
right when you're first there and then

462
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:45,120
the question is well how do you master

463
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:47,340
that and the answer to that seems to be

464
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:48,480
well it seems fairly straightforward if

465
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:50,370
the place that you're in

466
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,500
has any degree of possibility if it

467
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:55,590
isn't inhabited by demons so to speak

468
00:17:52,500 --> 00:17:57,059
the best way to act is to lift your aim

469
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:58,559
upward an attempt to get your act

470
00:17:57,059 --> 00:17:59,940
together and to tell the truth and to

471
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:02,190
live a meaningful life and to do

472
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:03,750
difficult things all of that and that is

473
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:06,660
the best way of mastering a new

474
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:09,120
territory and you know I all probability

475
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:11,250
the degree to which you're able to act

476
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,809
that out is precisely proportionate to

477
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:14,580
the degree to which you're going to

478
00:18:12,809 --> 00:18:16,230
become a master in that territory and

479
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:18,780
not sort of thinking having a lot faster

480
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:21,540
than people think you know it's it's

481
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:23,820
really quite remarkable how fast you can

482
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:26,309
move forward if you can establish

483
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:28,860
yourself somewhere and prove yourself

484
00:18:26,309 --> 00:18:31,559
useful assuming that you're around

485
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:33,360
people to whom proving yourself useful

486
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:34,590
actually matters like I know perfectly

487
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,240
well that you can end up in an

488
00:18:34,590 --> 00:18:38,429
employment situation where you're

489
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,780
punished for your virtues right in which

490
00:18:38,429 --> 00:18:41,910
case you should just get the hell out of

491
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:44,100
there and really really you get out of

492
00:18:41,910 --> 00:18:45,390
there and you go find somewhere where if

493
00:18:44,100 --> 00:18:46,770
you work hard and do what you're

494
00:18:45,390 --> 00:18:49,620
supposed to do you're actually going to

495
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:51,360
be rewarded right because that's not a

496
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:54,570
workplace that's hell and you should

497
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:56,460
just leave there so and God said unto

498
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:58,410
Abraham thou shalt keep my covenant

499
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:00,690
therefore thou and thy seed after thee

500
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:02,880
in their generations this is my covenant

501
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:04,980
which he shall keep between me and you

502
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:07,799
and thy seed after thee every man child

503
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:10,200
among you shall be circumcised that's a

504
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:11,820
mystery they're like why that particular

505
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:14,940
right what's dramatic I mean it

506
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:17,490
certainly it certainly affects a man

507
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:19,169
where he's most concerned to be affected

508
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:22,350
there's something like that and so it's

509
00:19:19,169 --> 00:19:23,309
it's a sacrifice that has a certain I

510
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:25,020
would say a certain degree of

511
00:19:23,309 --> 00:19:26,580
unforgettable 'ti that would be the

512
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:28,590
first thing and a certain degree of pain

513
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:29,700
and threat that goes along with it so

514
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:32,370
it's not nothing

515
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:35,730
that's the thing now you can argue and I

516
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:38,549
think there is an argument a case to be

517
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:41,910
made about whether or not in the modern

518
00:19:38,549 --> 00:19:43,830
world circumcision is a reasonable is

519
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:45,059
something reasonable to inflict on

520
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:48,750
infants I don't want to have that

521
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:51,090
conversation at all but I don't think

522
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:53,340
that's relevant to this particular issue

523
00:19:51,090 --> 00:19:55,429
because we're talking about something

524
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:59,400
different we're talking about humanity's

525
00:19:55,429 --> 00:20:01,770
attempt to reconcile themselves to the

526
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,279
fact that something has to be given up

527
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:04,200
in order

528
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:06,090
something else to happen and to try to

529
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,099
really work through that idea and to

530
00:20:06,090 --> 00:20:10,529
make it into a psychological reality and

531
00:20:08,099 --> 00:20:11,639
so far what we've seen in the biblical

532
00:20:10,529 --> 00:20:13,019
stories is that when you make a

533
00:20:11,639 --> 00:20:15,059
sacrifice it's not really something

534
00:20:13,019 --> 00:20:17,429
personal or psychological right it's

535
00:20:15,059 --> 00:20:19,529
something external and dramatic you give

536
00:20:17,429 --> 00:20:21,779
up something that you own you don't give

537
00:20:19,529 --> 00:20:24,479
up something that you are or that's part

538
00:20:21,779 --> 00:20:26,549
of you and it's actually more of a

539
00:20:24,479 --> 00:20:28,320
sacrifice to give up something that's a

540
00:20:26,549 --> 00:20:30,509
part of you or something that you are

541
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,279
than to give up something that you own I

542
00:20:30,509 --> 00:20:34,379
mean it's a subtle distinction between

543
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:36,210
because in some sense the distinction

544
00:20:34,379 --> 00:20:38,969
between what you own and what you are is

545
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:41,369
subtle right I mean it's not

546
00:20:38,969 --> 00:20:43,469
overwhelmingly subtle but but people

547
00:20:41,369 --> 00:20:44,849
identify with their possessions and they

548
00:20:43,469 --> 00:20:46,169
need to because otherwise they wouldn't

549
00:20:44,849 --> 00:20:48,389
care for them and they need their

550
00:20:46,169 --> 00:20:50,190
possessions in order to live so their

551
00:20:48,389 --> 00:20:53,309
possessions are in some sense integral

552
00:20:50,190 --> 00:20:56,519
to them but this transformation here of

553
00:20:53,309 --> 00:20:57,839
an act that was external and associated

554
00:20:56,519 --> 00:20:59,580
essentially with possessions to

555
00:20:57,839 --> 00:21:02,249
something that was actually at least

556
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:04,769
part of the body brings it much closer

557
00:21:02,249 --> 00:21:06,690
to it brings it much closer to the to

558
00:21:04,769 --> 00:21:10,950
the to the individual as a psychological

559
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:12,599
reality it's something like that and you

560
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:14,219
shall circumscribe is circumcised the

561
00:21:12,599 --> 00:21:16,889
flesh of your foreskin and it shall be a

562
00:21:14,219 --> 00:21:19,619
token of the Covenant betwixt me and you

563
00:21:16,889 --> 00:21:21,899
it's also a permanent marker you know

564
00:21:19,619 --> 00:21:24,089
and I've read a fair bit about practices

565
00:21:21,899 --> 00:21:25,469
like tattooing and body scarification

566
00:21:24,089 --> 00:21:27,359
you know which is those are very very

567
00:21:25,469 --> 00:21:29,429
common practices right they're human

568
00:21:27,359 --> 00:21:31,049
universals actually no matter where you

569
00:21:29,429 --> 00:21:32,909
go around the world you mean you see a

570
00:21:31,049 --> 00:21:34,649
couple of things first of all almost

571
00:21:32,909 --> 00:21:36,809
without exception people wear clothing

572
00:21:34,649 --> 00:21:40,109
and sometimes it's relatively minimal

573
00:21:36,809 --> 00:21:42,210
clothing but but it's and often it's

574
00:21:40,109 --> 00:21:45,269
more decorative than protective but it's

575
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:46,710
almost inevitably clothing and the other

576
00:21:45,269 --> 00:21:49,469
thing that you see is that people do

577
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:51,839
scarify and tattoo themselves and they

578
00:21:49,469 --> 00:21:53,389
do that in some manner to catalyze their

579
00:21:51,839 --> 00:21:56,369
identity right they're trying to

580
00:21:53,389 --> 00:21:59,009
transform themselves from a generic

581
00:21:56,369 --> 00:22:01,409
person in some sense to a person that's

582
00:21:59,009 --> 00:22:03,450
been designed by their own hand it's

583
00:22:01,409 --> 00:22:05,639
something like that they're it's a

584
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:07,499
marker of developing identity and some

585
00:22:05,639 --> 00:22:10,139
of it seems to be catalyzed with pain

586
00:22:07,499 --> 00:22:12,359
you know that modern people who tattoo

587
00:22:10,139 --> 00:22:14,460
and I'm not saying that I'm in favor of

588
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:15,720
tattooing because actually I'm not but

589
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:17,730
that but that

590
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:20,480
my own particular bias and if you have a

591
00:22:17,730 --> 00:22:22,530
tattoo that's fine with me

592
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,880
I'm also not saying that there's

593
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:26,789
anything wrong with it

594
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:28,620
but one of the things you do see what we

595
00:22:26,789 --> 00:22:30,780
the people who have it to tattoo do

596
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:33,720
report is a couple of things is that the

597
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:35,340
pain is actually necessary and that the

598
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:37,559
pain is actually something that seems to

599
00:22:35,340 --> 00:22:39,419
establish something like a memory so

600
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:40,860
well it's a memory because of the pain

601
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:43,320
because you plenty well remember things

602
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:45,270
that hurt but it's also a memory because

603
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:46,950
it's actually etched on you right it's

604
00:22:45,270 --> 00:22:49,169
not something that you can just abandon

605
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:50,669
and forget and so a circumcision is

606
00:22:49,169 --> 00:22:52,380
exactly the same thing it's like you

607
00:22:50,669 --> 00:22:54,299
don't forget it because it's part of you

608
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:57,120
and so it makes a good token for a

609
00:22:54,299 --> 00:22:59,250
covenant and so that seems to be the

610
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:01,320
rationale here from from speaking from a

611
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:03,929
psychological perspective it's to

612
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:06,090
indicate as well that the the damn thing

613
00:23:03,929 --> 00:23:07,770
that's happening is serious and I think

614
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:10,919
also that was the case with the earlier

615
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:12,419
sacrifices of animals it's like modern

616
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:14,130
people don't do this like you don't know

617
00:23:12,419 --> 00:23:16,620
how serious you would take a vow if you

618
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:18,240
sacrificed a goat in your backyard you

619
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:20,220
know it's actually a very dramatic thing

620
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,320
to do you know you think about it as

621
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:25,409
primitive and perhaps it is archaic and

622
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:27,210
and and no doubt it is but it's also to

623
00:23:25,409 --> 00:23:28,740
take the life of something and to spill

624
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:30,179
its blood that's no joke that's

625
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:32,280
something you remember especially if you

626
00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:34,230
haven't done it before and we actually

627
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:36,750
don't know what we would need to do in

628
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:38,280
order to take some things seriously you

629
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:40,110
know because we all do things like make

630
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:41,460
new year's resolutions about how we're

631
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:43,919
going to be better people and we don't

632
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:45,929
do it and the reason for that at least

633
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:49,020
in part is because we don't know how to

634
00:23:45,929 --> 00:23:52,380
make the sacrifice sufficiently bloody

635
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:54,299
let's say so that we remember that it's

636
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:56,280
necessary right we don't take it with

637
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:59,520
seriousness we don't think I should quit

638
00:23:56,280 --> 00:24:01,159
smoking because I'm going to die and we

639
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:03,330
don't think through what that means like

640
00:24:01,159 --> 00:24:05,669
coughing your lungs out for three months

641
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:09,090
in a hotel bed well your entire family

642
00:24:05,669 --> 00:24:11,010
is like a half repulsed and horrified

643
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:12,929
and sorrow stricken at the fact that

644
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:14,549
this has happened far too early you know

645
00:24:12,929 --> 00:24:17,460
we won't make that real enough to make

646
00:24:14,549 --> 00:24:20,909
it serious and serious and without that

647
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:22,740
seriousness we won't do it so there's

648
00:24:20,909 --> 00:24:24,840
something to be said for rituals of

649
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:27,480
seriousness and I think this is one of

650
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:29,400
them and he that is eight days shall be

651
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:31,380
circumcised among you every man

652
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:32,760
child in your generations he that is

653
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:35,060
born in the house or bought with money

654
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:37,710
of any stranger which is not a dice seed

655
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:39,960
this is from Charles John Ellicott who

656
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:42,480
was bishop of Gloucester the fitness of

657
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:45,480
circumcision to be a sign of entering

658
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:48,030
into a covenant and especially into one

659
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:50,190
to which children were to be admitted

660
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:52,560
consisted in its being a representation

661
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:55,380
of a new birth by putting off the old

662
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:57,630
man and the dedication of the new man

663
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:59,310
unto holiness it's like a baptism that's

664
00:24:57,630 --> 00:25:01,800
right that's that's what's that's what's

665
00:24:59,310 --> 00:25:04,080
echoed there and of course baptism is

666
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:05,850
returned to the pre cosmogonic chaos

667
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:08,160
because that's what the water indicates

668
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:10,020
and return to this source of life and

669
00:25:08,160 --> 00:25:11,880
and then the renewal that comes along

670
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:13,950
with it so it's the it's it's it's a

671
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:16,020
sacrificial idea in some sense that if

672
00:25:13,950 --> 00:25:18,840
there is to be a new you that the old

673
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:22,020
you has to dissolve has to return to the

674
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:24,150
solution from which it emerged initially

675
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:26,610
and to reconstitute itself and so

676
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:28,950
there's an echo of that idea here the

677
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:31,200
flesh was cast away that the spirit

678
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:33,120
might grow strong and the change of name

679
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,830
and Abram and Sarai was typical of this

680
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:37,140
change of condition they had been born

681
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:40,260
again and so must again be named and

682
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:42,150
though women could need be admitted

683
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:44,010
directly into the could not indeed be

684
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:45,930
admitted directly into the Covenant yet

685
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:48,150
they shared in its privileges by virtue

686
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:50,220
of their constant annuity to the men who

687
00:25:48,150 --> 00:25:51,750
were as sponsors for them and that Sarai

688
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:53,850
changes her name equally with her

689
00:25:51,750 --> 00:25:55,920
husband well you could make a case and

690
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:59,070
and anthropological observers have made

691
00:25:55,920 --> 00:26:01,830
this case to that women undergo a

692
00:25:59,070 --> 00:26:03,110
sufficiently a set of sufficiently

693
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:05,160
radical psychophysiological

694
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:08,670
transformations merely as a consequence

695
00:26:05,160 --> 00:26:12,240
of being part being feminine in nature

696
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:14,220
such that the additional rituals of

697
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:15,900
transformation that might be necessary

698
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:17,430
for men aren't necessary and one of

699
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:19,170
those might be menstruation because

700
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:20,960
that's a pretty dramatic transformation

701
00:26:19,170 --> 00:26:24,330
and there has been some indication that

702
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:26,010
circumcision is like a male it's like

703
00:26:24,330 --> 00:26:27,870
the male equivalent of menstruation

704
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:29,160
something like that because of the blood

705
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:30,840
that's involved and because of the

706
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:33,000
locale and then of course the same thing

707
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:34,410
is the case with women when they give

708
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,750
birth because that's a particularly

709
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:38,340
dramatic thing as I just witnessed

710
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:39,960
because my daughter just had a baby this

711
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:49,380
week so thank God for that

712
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:49,380
[Applause]

713
00:26:49,769 --> 00:26:54,459
recent investigation this is from the

714
00:26:52,209 --> 00:26:56,469
Cambridge Bible for school and colleges

715
00:26:54,459 --> 00:27:00,759
which if you want to read it is only 58

716
00:26:56,469 --> 00:27:02,019
volumes recent investigation is not

717
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:04,269
tended to support the theory that

718
00:27:02,019 --> 00:27:06,669
circumcision has any connection with

719
00:27:04,269 --> 00:27:08,619
primitive child sacrifice nor again that

720
00:27:06,669 --> 00:27:11,079
it took its origin from hygienic motives

721
00:27:08,619 --> 00:27:12,909
apparently it represents the dedication

722
00:27:11,079 --> 00:27:15,249
of the manhood of the people to God in

723
00:27:12,909 --> 00:27:16,779
the history of Israel it has survived as

724
00:27:15,249 --> 00:27:18,969
the symbol of the people belonging to

725
00:27:16,779 --> 00:27:21,639
Jehovah through his special election

726
00:27:18,969 --> 00:27:23,379
this corporeal sacrament remained to the

727
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:34,690
Israelite when when every other tie of

728
00:27:23,379 --> 00:27:37,509
religion or race had been severed the

729
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:39,190
other thing that that I read about in

730
00:27:37,509 --> 00:27:41,259
relationship to this idea of the

731
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:43,419
multi-generational covenant had

732
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:45,759
something to do because God told Abraham

733
00:27:43,419 --> 00:27:48,309
to include all of the people of his

734
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:50,919
household into this covenant and and

735
00:27:48,309 --> 00:27:53,589
that that that really meant that he was

736
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:55,719
establishing it a territory of ethics

737
00:27:53,589 --> 00:27:57,249
around them like the ark except the

738
00:27:55,719 --> 00:28:00,039
psychological equivalent of the ark

739
00:27:57,249 --> 00:28:02,289
right so it was it was a spiritual or

740
00:28:00,039 --> 00:28:04,979
psychological or ethical territory that

741
00:28:02,289 --> 00:28:08,469
everyone who was of that household was

742
00:28:04,979 --> 00:28:10,809
required to occupy or obliged or perhaps

743
00:28:08,469 --> 00:28:13,479
privileged to occupy and there was also

744
00:28:10,809 --> 00:28:15,729
an injunction to Abraham with regards to

745
00:28:13,479 --> 00:28:17,799
his children which was that as he had

746
00:28:15,729 --> 00:28:19,539
established a covenant with God which we

747
00:28:17,799 --> 00:28:22,749
could say is something like his decision

748
00:28:19,539 --> 00:28:25,659
to to aim as high as possible and to

749
00:28:22,749 --> 00:28:26,919
live properly as a consequence it's more

750
00:28:25,659 --> 00:28:30,579
than that but it's something like that

751
00:28:26,919 --> 00:28:34,089
that he also was under the supreme moral

752
00:28:30,579 --> 00:28:35,409
obligation to share that with his with

753
00:28:34,089 --> 00:28:38,109
the other men in his family especially

754
00:28:35,409 --> 00:28:41,229
as children and so and so I think

755
00:28:38,109 --> 00:28:43,929
there's also a call here to adopting a

756
00:28:41,229 --> 00:28:46,479
sacred the sacred responsibility in

757
00:28:43,929 --> 00:28:49,179
relationship to children that has to do

758
00:28:46,479 --> 00:28:51,579
with ensuring that they understand how

759
00:28:49,179 --> 00:28:53,730
to take their place in the world and I

760
00:28:51,579 --> 00:28:55,830
think that that's

761
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:58,530
definitely something very much worth

762
00:28:55,830 --> 00:29:00,720
considering especially given the

763
00:28:58,530 --> 00:29:04,200
emphasis in the Noah's story in the

764
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:06,150
story of Noah that Noah had his that his

765
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:08,340
generations were perfect right

766
00:29:06,150 --> 00:29:10,230
as I said before it wasn't merely that

767
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:12,180
he had walked with God that he had

768
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:13,980
perfected his own relationship with the

769
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:16,320
divine let's say with the transcendent

770
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:17,640
and I want to make that concrete which

771
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:21,090
is a strange thing to do with the

772
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:21,450
transcendent I mean people ask me all

773
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:23,850
the time

774
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:25,230
about what I believe and of course

775
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:29,820
that's what I'm trying to explain while

776
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:32,790
I'm talking but but but and and many

777
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:36,050
people of course are skeptical about the

778
00:29:32,790 --> 00:29:41,280
idea of anything transcendent and and

779
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:42,870
and say transcendent and eternal but

780
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,520
that can also be addressed from a

781
00:29:42,870 --> 00:29:48,300
psychological perspective because I

782
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:52,020
would say well if you have an ideal of

783
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:54,510
any sort how is that not transcendent it

784
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:56,730
transcends you that's the first thing

785
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:59,310
and it doesn't exist in reality it

786
00:29:56,730 --> 00:30:01,500
exists in a place of possibility and

787
00:29:59,310 --> 00:30:03,600
believe me man we treat places of

788
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:06,540
possibility as if they're real because

789
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:08,040
people will call on you you know about

790
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:09,060
your possibility in your potential

791
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:11,580
they'll say to you you're not

792
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:13,760
manifesting your full potential and you

793
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:17,400
might say well what do you mean by that

794
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:19,920
potential it doesn't exist it isn't here

795
00:30:17,400 --> 00:30:22,170
now you can't measure it or weigh it you

796
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:24,990
can't get a grip on it and they'll say

797
00:30:22,170 --> 00:30:26,310
don't rationalize you know perfectly

798
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:28,260
well what I mean when I'm talking about

799
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:30,300
your potential and so we could and you

800
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:32,010
do and everyone does and everyone knows

801
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:33,840
exactly what that means and so that's a

802
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:36,870
metaphysical reality that will

803
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:38,580
immediately accept as real and also

804
00:30:36,870 --> 00:30:41,040
castigate ourselves for not fulfilling

805
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:42,600
and others to like because you're just

806
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:43,740
not happy when the people around you

807
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:46,110
especially if you love them don't

808
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:47,820
fulfill their potential you really feel

809
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:49,350
that something has gone wrong and so

810
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:50,940
there's a transcendent reality and

811
00:30:49,350 --> 00:30:53,730
potential and then when you hypothesize

812
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:56,460
an ideal that you might pursue which you

813
00:30:53,730 --> 00:30:58,590
always do if you pursue anything right

814
00:30:56,460 --> 00:31:00,390
because to pursue something means you

815
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:02,220
don't already have it you're pursuing

816
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:04,020
something that doesn't exist you're

817
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:06,060
probably not pursuing something that's

818
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:07,530
worse than what you already have because

819
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:08,880
why the hell would you

820
00:31:07,530 --> 00:31:11,790
sooo it right that's completely

821
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:14,220
counterproductive so in in the mere fact

822
00:31:11,790 --> 00:31:17,460
of your pursuit you you pause it a

823
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:20,220
transcendent reality that you can that

824
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:22,440
you can that you can journey towards

825
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:24,690
that's more valuable than the reality

826
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:26,880
that you have now that's predicated in

827
00:31:24,690 --> 00:31:29,280
some sense on something like an eternal

828
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:32,820
Verity or an eternal truth it partakes

829
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:34,860
in the ideal and so we have an

830
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:36,420
relationship with the transcendent and

831
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:38,550
you might say well that doesn't mean you

832
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:41,220
have to personify the transcendent say

833
00:31:38,550 --> 00:31:44,010
as Jehovah you know the God the Father

834
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:45,660
but there's also some damn good reasons

835
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:49,040
for doing that because one of the things

836
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:51,600
that I've realized thinking through this

837
00:31:49,040 --> 00:31:54,390
covenant idea and also the sacrifice

838
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:57,600
idea is that the idea that the future is

839
00:31:54,390 --> 00:32:00,360
a judgmental father is a really really

840
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:02,280
good idea you know because you think

841
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:04,230
about what the future is in part I mean

842
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:06,380
the future is however the natural world

843
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:08,610
is going to lay itself out over the next

844
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:11,010
endless amount of time that isn't what I

845
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:13,290
mean I think more about your future now

846
00:32:11,010 --> 00:32:15,360
mostly your future is the future that

847
00:32:13,290 --> 00:32:16,590
you're going to negotiate with other

848
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,690
people but they're going to be other

849
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:20,280
people in the future and some of those

850
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:22,740
people are going to be you in the future

851
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:24,420
and family members in the future and so

852
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:27,120
what's happening right now is that if

853
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:30,540
you make the sacrifices properly then

854
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:32,310
you're actually pleasing that future set

855
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:34,590
of people and that future set of people

856
00:32:32,310 --> 00:32:36,930
is definitely going to serve as a judge

857
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:38,820
that's exactly what it does that's

858
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:40,470
precisely what it does and so you might

859
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:43,590
say well it was the brilliant

860
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:46,020
imagination of mankind that hypothesized

861
00:32:43,590 --> 00:32:48,150
that the best way to think about the

862
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:50,610
social group including the family but

863
00:32:48,150 --> 00:32:52,830
also including you as your future self

864
00:32:50,610 --> 00:32:55,920
was to consider that you live in

865
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:59,250
relationship with a future father who's

866
00:32:55,920 --> 00:33:02,040
a judge it's like yes that's exactly

867
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:03,750
right now is it right right or is it

868
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:06,960
psychologically right well it's at least

869
00:33:03,750 --> 00:33:08,190
psychologically right and you know one

870
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:11,370
of the things I've learned about the

871
00:33:08,190 --> 00:33:12,810
biblical stories is that to say that

872
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:16,250
they're psychologically right doesn't

873
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:20,040
exhaust the ways in which they're right

874
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:21,389
but it at least gives rational modern

875
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:23,429
people who are skeptical

876
00:33:21,389 --> 00:33:29,129
properly so a better way of getting a

877
00:33:23,429 --> 00:33:31,109
grip on them so and the uncircumcised

878
00:33:29,129 --> 00:33:33,089
man child whose flesh of his foreskin is

879
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:34,950
not circumcised that soul shall be cut

880
00:33:33,089 --> 00:33:37,879
off from his people he had broken my

881
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:40,649
covenant so it's a serious contractual

882
00:33:37,879 --> 00:33:42,749
relationship now I was thinking about

883
00:33:40,649 --> 00:33:44,190
how to understand this and I remembered

884
00:33:42,749 --> 00:33:47,639
this old story which I'm going to read

885
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:49,559
to you about a monkey so there's an old

886
00:33:47,639 --> 00:33:51,359
impossibly apocryphal story about how to

887
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:53,759
catch a monkey that illustrates this set

888
00:33:51,359 --> 00:33:56,039
of ideas very well first so goes the

889
00:33:53,759 --> 00:33:58,919
story you have to find a large narrow

890
00:33:56,039 --> 00:34:00,479
neck jar just barely wide enough in

891
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:03,209
diameter for a monkey to put his hand

892
00:34:00,479 --> 00:34:05,849
inside and then you have to fill the jar

893
00:34:03,209 --> 00:34:07,919
up with rocks so that it's too heavy for

894
00:34:05,849 --> 00:34:09,750
the monkey to carry away and then you

895
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:13,079
scatter some treats around the jar that

896
00:34:09,750 --> 00:34:15,299
are attractive to monkeys and close to

897
00:34:13,079 --> 00:34:17,309
the jar and then you put a few of those

898
00:34:15,299 --> 00:34:18,839
treats inside the jar and so that's the

899
00:34:17,309 --> 00:34:20,129
first part of the trick and then the

900
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:21,629
second part of the trick is the monkey

901
00:34:20,129 --> 00:34:23,220
comes along and gathers up the treats

902
00:34:21,629 --> 00:34:25,519
and then puts his hand in the jar and

903
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:28,109
grabs the treats that are in there but

904
00:34:25,519 --> 00:34:29,519
it's narrow necked and so once the

905
00:34:28,109 --> 00:34:31,559
monkey puts his hand in there and grabs

906
00:34:29,519 --> 00:34:33,929
the goodies then he can't get his hand

907
00:34:31,559 --> 00:34:35,039
out of the damn jar and so then you can

908
00:34:33,929 --> 00:34:36,720
just come along and pick up the monkey

909
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:39,440
and like too bad for the monkey rights

910
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:41,819
like he shouldn't let go of what he had

911
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,710
so that something terrible didn't happen

912
00:34:41,819 --> 00:34:45,960
to him but that isn't what the monkey

913
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:48,659
will do because he can't sacrifice the

914
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:50,909
part for the hole and there's something

915
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:52,950
about the circumcision story that's

916
00:34:50,909 --> 00:34:56,129
about that it's about sacrificing the

917
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:57,329
part to save the whole and I mean

918
00:34:56,129 --> 00:34:58,920
there's an echo of that in the New

919
00:34:57,329 --> 00:35:00,839
Testament if I remember correctly I

920
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:04,200
believe it's I believe this is correct

921
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:06,210
although it might not be where Christ

922
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:08,549
tells his disciples to pluck out their

923
00:35:06,210 --> 00:35:12,359
eye if it offends them seems like a very

924
00:35:08,549 --> 00:35:14,309
dramatic you know piece of advice but

925
00:35:12,359 --> 00:35:17,130
it's it's partaking of the same idea

926
00:35:14,309 --> 00:35:19,019
which is that now if there's something

927
00:35:17,130 --> 00:35:20,490
holding you back we'll see this when we

928
00:35:19,019 --> 00:35:22,470
get to the story of law - if there's

929
00:35:20,490 --> 00:35:26,099
something holding you back even if it's

930
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:28,019
beer to you you have to let it go you

931
00:35:26,099 --> 00:35:29,910
seriously have to let it go because

932
00:35:28,019 --> 00:35:33,390
there isn't anything more important than

933
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:35,420
progressing forward and cheap sympathy

934
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:38,850
cheap empathy cheap

935
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:41,340
nostalgia none of that is sufficient

936
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:43,020
none of that will work because the

937
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:45,450
consequences of not putting things

938
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:50,280
together immediately are dire and

939
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:52,200
there's no time to wait and God said

940
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:54,060
unto Abraham as for Sarai thy wife thou

941
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:56,490
shalt not call her name Sarai but Sarah

942
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:58,590
shall be her name my princess

943
00:35:56,490 --> 00:36:00,450
that was suraíh Sarah is mother of

944
00:35:58,590 --> 00:36:03,180
Nations and I will bless her and give

945
00:36:00,450 --> 00:36:04,350
thee a son also of her yea I will bless

946
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:07,140
her she will be a mother of Nations

947
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:08,670
kings of people shall be of her then a

948
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:11,370
hebrew ham fell on his face and laughed

949
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:13,020
and said in his heart shall a child be

950
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:15,240
born unto him that is a hundred years

951
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:17,370
old he's got a lot of doll I would say I

952
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:18,930
mean there's God talking to him any

953
00:36:17,370 --> 00:36:20,760
laughs you know but that's okay that's

954
00:36:18,930 --> 00:36:24,090
he's a courageous guy and that's what

955
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:26,910
people are like and and shall Sarah that

956
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:28,740
is 90 years old bear and Abraham said

957
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:32,070
unto God oh that Ishmael might live

958
00:36:28,740 --> 00:36:34,860
before thee and God said Sarah thy wife

959
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:36,690
shall bear thee a son indeed and thou

960
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:38,340
shalt call his name Isaac and I will

961
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:39,990
establish my covenant with him for an

962
00:36:38,340 --> 00:36:42,780
everlasting covenant and with his seed

963
00:36:39,990 --> 00:36:45,120
after him and as for Ishmael I've heard

964
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:46,740
thee behold I have blessed him and will

965
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:48,780
make him fruitful and will multiply him

966
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:51,480
exceedingly 12 Prince's shall he beget

967
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:54,000
and I will make him a great nation now

968
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:56,160
what does this mean this is this is a

969
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,360
miraculous story in some sense right

970
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:59,790
because well Sarah

971
00:36:57,360 --> 00:37:01,560
it's what the Isaac want or what Abraham

972
00:36:59,790 --> 00:37:03,330
wants most is to have a son but it looks

973
00:37:01,560 --> 00:37:05,370
like it's pretty much impossible and I I

974
00:37:03,330 --> 00:37:10,680
think what the story is attempting to

975
00:37:05,370 --> 00:37:13,170
indicate is something like god only

976
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:15,600
knows what will happen to you if you put

977
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:18,330
your house in order certainly things

978
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:22,560
that you do not currently regard as

979
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:24,420
possible will happen and the more you

980
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:26,370
put your house in order the more things

981
00:37:24,420 --> 00:37:30,060
that you regard as impossible will

982
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:31,800
happen and it might be the case that if

983
00:37:30,060 --> 00:37:34,230
you put your host together sufficiently

984
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:37,080
things that were of miraculous

985
00:37:34,230 --> 00:37:38,730
impossibility would happen to you well

986
00:37:37,080 --> 00:37:41,070
and there's no way of knowing until you

987
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:43,800
try it but there's no way of being sure

988
00:37:41,070 --> 00:37:47,840
that it's not the case unless you do and

989
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:51,820
my experience has been that

990
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:54,650
I don't mean just personally I mean that

991
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:57,860
the world is a remarkable and mysterious

992
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:59,510
place and the relationship between the

993
00:37:57,860 --> 00:38:01,850
nature and structure of the world and

994
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:03,650
your actions is indeterminate they may

995
00:38:01,850 --> 00:38:05,750
be more tightly related than you think

996
00:38:03,650 --> 00:38:08,840
and I don't know how to square that with

997
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:12,350
the fact that well you're obviously in a

998
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:19,040
mortal body and constrained by all sorts

999
00:38:12,350 --> 00:38:22,220
of serious constraints and none of that

1000
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:24,200
none of that can be trivially overcome

1001
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:27,440
and I don't really understand how there

1002
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:29,510
can be that seriousness of mortal

1003
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:31,280
constraint and the infinite potential

1004
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:33,950
that also seems to characterize human

1005
00:38:31,280 --> 00:38:35,420
beings all at the same time but then I

1006
00:38:33,950 --> 00:38:37,340
don't really understand anything about

1007
00:38:35,420 --> 00:38:42,170
the nature of reality so that's just one

1008
00:38:37,340 --> 00:38:44,090
more mystery to add to the pile so but

1009
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:46,100
my covenant I will establish his Isaac

1010
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:48,230
which share a Sarah shall bear unto thee

1011
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:50,030
at the set time next year and he left

1012
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:51,830
off talking with him and God went up

1013
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:53,720
from Abraham and Abraham took Ishmael

1014
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:55,040
his son and all that were born in this

1015
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:56,840
house and all that were bought with his

1016
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:58,730
money every male among the men of

1017
00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:00,230
Abraham's house and circumcised the

1018
00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:03,020
flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame

1019
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:04,850
as God had said unto him that must have

1020
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:09,680
been an interesting conversation that's

1021
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:15,140
I mean really this is what God told you

1022
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:17,020
to do it like okay and Abraham was

1023
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:19,340
ninety years old and nine when he was

1024
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:21,440
circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin

1025
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:23,900
and Ishmael was thirteen years old when

1026
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:26,210
he was circumcised in the cell same day

1027
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:27,350
was Abraham circumcised and his son and

1028
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:28,880
all the men of his house

1029
00:39:27,350 --> 00:39:30,830
ORN in the house and bought with money

1030
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:35,180
of the stranger were circumcised with

1031
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:36,770
him all right so that's the renewal of

1032
00:39:35,180 --> 00:39:38,570
the Covenant that's the next part of the

1033
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:40,850
story that's the circumcision that's the

1034
00:39:38,570 --> 00:39:43,150
circumcision story and as I said it

1035
00:39:40,850 --> 00:39:46,100
seems to indicate to me something about

1036
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:49,610
seriousness of intent something about

1037
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:51,500
the responsibility that Abraham

1038
00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:54,440
determines to take for everyone that's

1039
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:56,300
part of his household the psychological

1040
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:59,960
increasing psychological transformation

1041
00:39:56,300 --> 00:40:01,640
of the idea of sacrifice the necessity

1042
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:05,150
of doing something memorable

1043
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:09,290
and the the what would you call it the

1044
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:11,750
end the utility of rekindling the aims

1045
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:13,940
of your highest values when you come to

1046
00:40:11,750 --> 00:40:16,340
the end of an epoch in your life when

1047
00:40:13,940 --> 00:40:17,990
you have to take stock again right you

1048
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:19,760
take stock of yourself that's really

1049
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:21,560
what that phrase means to take stock is

1050
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:24,920
to take stock of yourself and to decide

1051
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:27,470
ok well what should move forward in time

1052
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:30,320
with me and what should be let go as if

1053
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:32,510
it's Deadwood and the more Deadwood that

1054
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:34,220
you let go of and burn off when you have

1055
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:35,660
the opportunity the less it accretes

1056
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:38,390
around you here's something interesting

1057
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:40,070
about forest fires you know people have

1058
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:41,840
been trying to prevent forest fires for

1059
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:43,550
a long time especially that damn bear

1060
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:44,300
smokey right he's trying to prevent

1061
00:40:43,550 --> 00:40:47,690
forest fires

1062
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:49,790
and so because forest fires burn up the

1063
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:52,130
forest and that can't be good but here's

1064
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:54,470
what happens if you don't let forest

1065
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:56,920
fires burn is that

1066
00:40:54,470 --> 00:40:59,480
well forests collect a lot of dry

1067
00:40:56,920 --> 00:41:03,350
branches right because tree branches guy

1068
00:40:59,480 --> 00:41:06,050
and wood falls on the forest floor and

1069
00:41:03,350 --> 00:41:09,280
collects and so the amount of flammable

1070
00:41:06,050 --> 00:41:12,830
material keeps increasing with time and

1071
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:14,360
that's not so bad if it's wet but if the

1072
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:16,430
amount of flammable material is

1073
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:18,710
increasing and it gets really dry and

1074
00:41:16,430 --> 00:41:21,890
then it burns then you have a real

1075
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:24,950
problem the forest fire can burn so hot

1076
00:41:21,890 --> 00:41:27,350
that it burns root does pop soil right

1077
00:41:24,950 --> 00:41:28,730
off in which case you don't have a

1078
00:41:27,350 --> 00:41:31,940
forest at all anymore you just have a

1079
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:33,740
desert and lots of trees are evolved to

1080
00:41:31,940 --> 00:41:36,410
withstand forest fires of a certain

1081
00:41:33,740 --> 00:41:38,420
intensity and some won't even release

1082
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:41,600
their seeds unless there's been a fire

1083
00:41:38,420 --> 00:41:44,330
and so a little bit of fire at the right

1084
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:46,400
time can stop everything from burning to

1085
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:49,610
the ground and that's also a really

1086
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:52,130
useful insight a metaphorical insight

1087
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:53,960
into the nature of sacrifice right it's

1088
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:55,940
also a lot easier to let go of something

1089
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:57,920
when you're deciding to let go of it

1090
00:41:55,940 --> 00:41:59,720
because you've decided yourself that

1091
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:02,570
it's you're done with that it's a weak

1092
00:41:59,720 --> 00:42:04,730
part of you it needs to disappear you do

1093
00:42:02,570 --> 00:42:06,920
that yourself it's much better and much

1094
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:08,570
easier than it is if it's taken away

1095
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:11,660
from you forcibly in which case you're

1096
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:13,760
very much likely to fight it these other

1097
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:15,330
there's another interesting thing here a

1098
00:42:13,760 --> 00:42:16,770
motif that runs

1099
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:18,600
the entire Bible it's a very very

1100
00:42:16,770 --> 00:42:20,370
powerful motif and it's partly

1101
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:24,120
associated with this idea of walking

1102
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:25,950
with or walking before God and you know

1103
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:28,380
in the New Testament Christ says

1104
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:30,900
something like thy father's will be done

1105
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:35,610
and he means that that will should be

1106
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:37,050
done through him and so I can't I won't

1107
00:42:35,610 --> 00:42:39,000
build a state that's exactly right but

1108
00:42:37,050 --> 00:42:40,860
it's something like this you know a lot

1109
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:43,560
of what people regard as their own

1110
00:42:40,860 --> 00:42:45,480
personalities and and are proud of about

1111
00:42:43,560 --> 00:42:48,440
their own personalities aren't their own

1112
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:51,800
personalities at all they're useless

1113
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:53,970
idiosyncrasies that differ them

1114
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:56,130
differentiate them trivially from other

1115
00:42:53,970 --> 00:42:58,080
people but they have no value in and of

1116
00:42:56,130 --> 00:43:00,510
themselves they're more like quirks I

1117
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:04,200
remember once I was trying to teach a

1118
00:43:00,510 --> 00:43:07,560
particularly stubborn student about how

1119
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:10,200
to write and she had written a number of

1120
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:12,840
essays in in University and got

1121
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:14,040
universally walloped for them and the

1122
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:17,010
reason for that was she couldn't write

1123
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:19,770
really at all she was really really bad

1124
00:43:17,010 --> 00:43:22,950
at writing and so I was sitting down

1125
00:43:19,770 --> 00:43:26,460
with her trying to explain to her what

1126
00:43:22,950 --> 00:43:28,440
she was doing wrong and she was being

1127
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:30,690
very annoying about it very recalcitrant

1128
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:33,140
very very unwilling to listen that was a

1129
00:43:30,690 --> 00:43:36,060
pearls before swine thing you know and

1130
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:37,530
at one point she said it I can write

1131
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:39,540
perfectly well this university

1132
00:43:37,530 --> 00:43:41,520
professors just don't like my style and

1133
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:48,180
I could see all my hands creep towards

1134
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:50,940
her neck yeah well then I'd be funny if

1135
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:52,350
it wasn't true but was also true you

1136
00:43:50,940 --> 00:43:55,440
know and I thought what the hell's with

1137
00:43:52,350 --> 00:43:57,660
you you can't even write and you think

1138
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:59,900
you have a style and normally do you

1139
00:43:57,660 --> 00:43:59,900
think

1140
00:44:03,140 --> 00:44:07,980
ya know not knowing how to write is not

1141
00:44:06,030 --> 00:44:11,790
a style that's the other point right and

1142
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:13,710
so you know she she instead of humbling

1143
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:15,060
herself which was necessary and okay

1144
00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:16,200
right cuz she was a new University

1145
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:17,370
students like of course you don't know

1146
00:44:16,200 --> 00:44:27,600
how to write when were you gonna learn

1147
00:44:17,370 --> 00:44:30,120
in school I don't think so so she had

1148
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:32,100
this you know this this this style issue

1149
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:35,100
and it it just it just didn't go

1150
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:36,510
anywhere at all and so now let's see I

1151
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:40,560
lost my train of thought and telling you

1152
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:42,930
tell me all those jokes oh yes in terms

1153
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:44,460
of above letting things burn off yeah

1154
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:46,590
well so she was proud of her

1155
00:44:44,460 --> 00:44:48,450
insufficiency that's arrogance right

1156
00:44:46,590 --> 00:44:50,160
that's not humility it's self-deception

1157
00:44:48,450 --> 00:44:51,510
and arrogance to be proud of your

1158
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:53,520
insufficiency that's a very foolish

1159
00:44:51,510 --> 00:44:54,930
thing and that means to cling to the

1160
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:57,150
parts of you that are dead

1161
00:44:54,930 --> 00:44:59,580
okay now there's this idea that runs

1162
00:44:57,150 --> 00:45:05,850
through the Bible I think as a whole

1163
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:07,890
that okay I'll tell you another little

1164
00:45:05,850 --> 00:45:09,740
side story here I was reading about

1165
00:45:07,890 --> 00:45:13,260
Socrates today and I was reading about

1166
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:16,770
Socrates trial you know he was tried by

1167
00:45:13,260 --> 00:45:18,570
the Athenians for corrupting for failing

1168
00:45:16,770 --> 00:45:20,580
to worship the correct gods and

1169
00:45:18,570 --> 00:45:22,200
corrupting the youth of Athens by like

1170
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:23,940
teaching them stuff and asking them

1171
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:28,260
questions you know which is great way to

1172
00:45:23,940 --> 00:45:31,470
corrupt people and so he knew the trial

1173
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:33,180
was coming and Athens wasn't a very big

1174
00:45:31,470 --> 00:45:34,860
place only on about 25,000 people

1175
00:45:33,180 --> 00:45:36,870
everybody knew everybody everybody knew

1176
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:40,080
who the powerful guys were and everybody

1177
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:41,040
including Socrates knew that the trial

1178
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:43,590
was a warning

1179
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:45,240
do you like get out of town right we're

1180
00:45:43,590 --> 00:45:49,290
going to put you on trial in six months

1181
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:53,190
and the potential penalty is best got

1182
00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:55,770
that it's like so so Socrates had a chat

1183
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:59,010
with his compatriots and they were

1184
00:45:55,770 --> 00:46:01,170
contemplating fair means and foul to set

1185
00:45:59,010 --> 00:46:03,450
up a defense for him so that he could or

1186
00:46:01,170 --> 00:46:07,650
to leave so that he could not be tried

1187
00:46:03,450 --> 00:46:09,270
and put to death and he decided that he

1188
00:46:07,650 --> 00:46:11,910
wasn't going to do that and he also

1189
00:46:09,270 --> 00:46:12,570
decided that he wasn't going to even

1190
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:15,840
think about

1191
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:18,240
his defense and he said why this is

1192
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:22,200
quite an interesting thing he said why

1193
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:24,600
he told one of his friends that he had

1194
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:28,640
this voice in his head

1195
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:31,350
a daemon a spirit something like that

1196
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:32,610
that he always listened to and that that

1197
00:46:31,350 --> 00:46:33,660
was one of the reasons he was different

1198
00:46:32,610 --> 00:46:35,010
from other people because he always

1199
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:36,330
listened to this thing it didn't tell

1200
00:46:35,010 --> 00:46:38,400
him what to do but it told him what not

1201
00:46:36,330 --> 00:46:40,470
to do it always told him what not to do

1202
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:42,090
and if it told him not to do something

1203
00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:45,380
then he didn't do it if he was speaking

1204
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:47,880
and the little voice came up and said no

1205
00:46:45,380 --> 00:46:49,710
then he shut up and he tried to say

1206
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:51,300
something else and he was very emphatic

1207
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:55,560
about this and he said that when he

1208
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:58,380
tried to plan to evade the trial or even

1209
00:46:55,560 --> 00:47:02,700
to mount his own defence the voice came

1210
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:05,670
up and said no don't bother with it and

1211
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:07,770
he thought well what would he what the

1212
00:47:05,670 --> 00:47:09,780
hell do you mean by that like there's a

1213
00:47:07,770 --> 00:47:12,390
trial coming and I'm going to be put to

1214
00:47:09,780 --> 00:47:16,320
death and well he eventually concluded

1215
00:47:12,390 --> 00:47:18,450
that he was an old guy you know the next

1216
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:19,800
10 years he was in his 70s perhaps the

1217
00:47:18,450 --> 00:47:22,830
next 10 years weren't going to be that

1218
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:24,180
great for him he got a chance maybe the

1219
00:47:22,830 --> 00:47:26,190
gods were giving him a chance just to

1220
00:47:24,180 --> 00:47:27,810
bow out you know to put his affairs in

1221
00:47:26,190 --> 00:47:30,840
order to say goodbye to everyone to

1222
00:47:27,810 --> 00:47:32,100
avoid that last descent into catastrophe

1223
00:47:30,840 --> 00:47:34,020
which might have been particularly

1224
00:47:32,100 --> 00:47:37,820
painful for a philosopher and to and to

1225
00:47:34,020 --> 00:47:43,260
walk off the world on his own terms

1226
00:47:37,820 --> 00:47:45,780
something like that the point I'm making

1227
00:47:43,260 --> 00:47:47,940
with that is that Socrates attended to

1228
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:50,040
this internal voice that at least told

1229
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:51,570
him what not to do and then he didn't do

1230
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:53,130
it and of course Socrates was a very

1231
00:47:51,570 --> 00:47:54,750
remarkable man and we still hear about

1232
00:47:53,130 --> 00:47:57,570
him today and we know that he existed

1233
00:47:54,750 --> 00:48:02,390
and all of those things and so back to

1234
00:47:57,570 --> 00:48:08,450
the back to the walking with God idea

1235
00:48:02,390 --> 00:48:08,450
you know as you elevate your aim you

1236
00:48:08,930 --> 00:48:14,370
create a judge at the same time right

1237
00:48:11,610 --> 00:48:16,950
because the new ideal which is an ideal

1238
00:48:14,370 --> 00:48:18,420
you even if it's just an ideal position

1239
00:48:16,950 --> 00:48:20,700
that you might occupy even if it's still

1240
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:23,160
conceptualized in that concrete way that

1241
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:25,620
becomes a judge because it's above you

1242
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:26,789
right and then you're you're terrified

1243
00:48:25,620 --> 00:48:28,079
of it maybe

1244
00:48:26,789 --> 00:48:29,999
why you might be afraid when you go

1245
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:31,559
start a new job right because your this

1246
00:48:29,999 --> 00:48:33,599
thing is above you and you're terrified

1247
00:48:31,559 --> 00:48:36,509
of it and it judges you and that's

1248
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:38,459
useful because that's the judge that

1249
00:48:36,509 --> 00:48:41,189
you're creating by formulating the idea

1250
00:48:38,459 --> 00:48:43,439
tells you what's useless about yourself

1251
00:48:41,189 --> 00:48:45,509
and then you can dispense with it and

1252
00:48:43,439 --> 00:48:47,189
you want to keep doing that and then

1253
00:48:45,509 --> 00:48:48,989
every time you make a judge that's more

1254
00:48:47,189 --> 00:48:51,089
elevated then there's more useless you

1255
00:48:48,989 --> 00:48:53,849
that has to be dispensed with and then

1256
00:48:51,089 --> 00:48:55,919
if you recreate an ultimate judge which

1257
00:48:53,849 --> 00:48:58,469
is what the archetypal imagination of

1258
00:48:55,919 --> 00:49:00,390
humankind has done say with the figure

1259
00:48:58,469 --> 00:49:02,309
of Christ because if Christ is nothing

1260
00:49:00,390 --> 00:49:05,160
else he is at least the archetypal

1261
00:49:02,309 --> 00:49:06,749
perfect man and therefore the judge you

1262
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:08,999
have a judge that says get rid of

1263
00:49:06,749 --> 00:49:10,619
everything about yourself that isn't

1264
00:49:08,999 --> 00:49:12,179
perfect of course that's also what

1265
00:49:10,619 --> 00:49:15,029
Abraham that's also what God tells

1266
00:49:12,179 --> 00:49:17,489
Abraham right he says to be perfect to

1267
00:49:15,029 --> 00:49:18,900
pick an ideal that's high enough and you

1268
00:49:17,489 --> 00:49:20,789
can do this the thing that's interesting

1269
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:22,650
about this I think is you can do it more

1270
00:49:20,789 --> 00:49:24,660
or less on your own terms you have to

1271
00:49:22,650 --> 00:49:26,459
have some collaboration from other

1272
00:49:24,660 --> 00:49:28,259
people but you don't have to pick an

1273
00:49:26,459 --> 00:49:30,539
external ideal you can pick an ideal

1274
00:49:28,259 --> 00:49:33,449
that fulfills the role of ideal for you

1275
00:49:30,539 --> 00:49:35,400
you can say okay well if things could be

1276
00:49:33,449 --> 00:49:37,349
set up for me the way I need them to be

1277
00:49:35,400 --> 00:49:40,380
and if I could be who I needed to be

1278
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:41,609
what would that look like and you can

1279
00:49:40,380 --> 00:49:43,019
figure that out for yourself and then

1280
00:49:41,609 --> 00:49:44,069
instantly you have a judge and I also

1281
00:49:43,019 --> 00:49:46,439
think that's part of the reason people

1282
00:49:44,069 --> 00:49:49,259
don't do it right why don't why don't

1283
00:49:46,439 --> 00:49:51,449
people look up and move ahead an answer

1284
00:49:49,259 --> 00:49:53,400
is well you know you start formulating

1285
00:49:51,449 --> 00:49:55,499
an ideal you formulate a judge it's

1286
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:57,299
pretty easy to feel intimidated in the

1287
00:49:55,499 --> 00:49:59,789
face of your own ideal that's what

1288
00:49:57,299 --> 00:50:01,650
happens to Kane vs Abel for example then

1289
00:49:59,789 --> 00:50:03,299
it's really easy to destroy the ideal

1290
00:50:01,650 --> 00:50:05,640
instead of to try to pursue it because

1291
00:50:03,299 --> 00:50:08,459
then you get rid of the judge but it's

1292
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:10,319
way better lower the damn judge if it's

1293
00:50:08,459 --> 00:50:12,509
too much like if your current ambition

1294
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:14,099
is crushing you you know then maybe

1295
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:16,559
you're playing the tyrant to yourself

1296
00:50:14,099 --> 00:50:18,059
and you should cap down your ambitions

1297
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:19,769
not get rid of them by any stretch of

1298
00:50:18,059 --> 00:50:22,499
the imagination but at least put them

1299
00:50:19,769 --> 00:50:23,939
more reasonably within your grasp you

1300
00:50:22,499 --> 00:50:26,489
don't have to leap from point one to

1301
00:50:23,939 --> 00:50:28,829
point 50 and one leap right you can do

1302
00:50:26,489 --> 00:50:31,459
it incrementally but I really like this

1303
00:50:28,829 --> 00:50:35,009
idea I think it's a profound idea that

1304
00:50:31,459 --> 00:50:37,679
the process of recapitulating yourself

1305
00:50:35,009 --> 00:50:39,599
continually is also the process of it's

1306
00:50:37,679 --> 00:50:40,290
a phoenix-like process right you're

1307
00:50:39,599 --> 00:50:42,150
shedding

1308
00:50:40,290 --> 00:50:44,310
and all those elements of you that are

1309
00:50:42,150 --> 00:50:48,180
no longer worthy of the pursuits that

1310
00:50:44,310 --> 00:50:51,030
you're that you're valuing and then I

1311
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:54,650
would say the idea here is that as you

1312
00:50:51,030 --> 00:50:57,930
do that you shape yourself ever more

1313
00:50:54,650 --> 00:51:00,180
precisely into something that can

1314
00:50:57,930 --> 00:51:03,570
withstand the tragedy of life and that

1315
00:51:00,180 --> 00:51:04,890
can act as a as a beacon to the world

1316
00:51:03,570 --> 00:51:06,960
that's the right way of thinking about

1317
00:51:04,890 --> 00:51:08,790
it maybe first to your friends and then

1318
00:51:06,960 --> 00:51:10,740
to your family it's like it's a hell of

1319
00:51:08,790 --> 00:51:13,140
a fine ambition and there's no reason

1320
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:15,030
that it can't happen you know every one

1321
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:16,830
of you knows people who are really

1322
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:18,900
bloody useful in a crisis and people

1323
00:51:16,830 --> 00:51:20,340
that you admire right those are all you

1324
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:22,560
can think of all those people as you

1325
00:51:20,340 --> 00:51:25,740
admire that you admire us partial

1326
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:27,510
incarnations of the archetypal Messiah

1327
00:51:25,740 --> 00:51:30,060
that's exactly right

1328
00:51:27,510 --> 00:51:32,250
and the more that that manifests itself

1329
00:51:30,060 --> 00:51:34,320
at any given person then the more

1330
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:36,750
generally useful and admirable that

1331
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:38,850
person is in a multitude of situations

1332
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:40,950
and we don't know the limit to that but

1333
00:51:38,850 --> 00:51:43,230
people can be unbelievably good for

1334
00:51:40,950 --> 00:51:46,790
things you know it's really something to

1335
00:51:43,230 --> 00:51:49,890
behold so that's what God tells Abraham

1336
00:51:46,790 --> 00:51:51,720
okay so the next story is about Abraham

1337
00:51:49,890 --> 00:51:53,490
and these angels Ames will show up on

1338
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:55,800
his doorstep and this is part of the

1339
00:51:53,490 --> 00:51:58,710
story of Sodom and Gomorrah but I don't

1340
00:51:55,800 --> 00:52:01,350
think as I said this story is generally

1341
00:51:58,710 --> 00:52:03,090
read as if it's about homosexuality but

1342
00:52:01,350 --> 00:52:08,160
I don't think it is here I think it's

1343
00:52:03,090 --> 00:52:10,280
about two things primarily one is how do

1344
00:52:08,160 --> 00:52:12,990
you treat the strange

1345
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:15,420
so the strangest strange things and

1346
00:52:12,990 --> 00:52:17,370
strange ideas and strange people and

1347
00:52:15,420 --> 00:52:19,440
strangers right it's all about it it's

1348
00:52:17,370 --> 00:52:22,050
that which is not you it's like the

1349
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:25,170
strange lands that God asked Abraham to

1350
00:52:22,050 --> 00:52:28,080
move out into how do you interact with

1351
00:52:25,170 --> 00:52:30,450
this strange and here here's one

1352
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:33,090
possible rule because you could say to

1353
00:52:30,450 --> 00:52:35,010
yourself well what what do I want to

1354
00:52:33,090 --> 00:52:36,750
make friends with more where do I want

1355
00:52:35,010 --> 00:52:38,370
to be more comfortable do I want to be

1356
00:52:36,750 --> 00:52:40,830
more comfortable with that which I

1357
00:52:38,370 --> 00:52:42,330
already know and so that would be the

1358
00:52:40,830 --> 00:52:44,370
circumscribed territory that you've

1359
00:52:42,330 --> 00:52:46,560
already mastered or do I want to be

1360
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:50,100
comfortable with all those things I

1361
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:51,450
don't know and then the right answer is

1362
00:52:50,100 --> 00:52:52,620
that you should want to be comfortable

1363
00:52:51,450 --> 00:52:53,880
with all those things that you don't

1364
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:55,650
know because there is a

1365
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:58,560
bloody lot of things that you don't know

1366
00:52:55,650 --> 00:53:00,720
and if you can be a Sojourner among what

1367
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:02,790
you don't know well then you're so

1368
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:04,230
protected because well you're going to

1369
00:53:02,790 --> 00:53:05,610
go lots of places where you don't know

1370
00:53:04,230 --> 00:53:07,290
and you're going to be able to manage it

1371
00:53:05,610 --> 00:53:09,630
so you want to be you want to be that

1372
00:53:07,290 --> 00:53:16,230
person that can act where they don't

1373
00:53:09,630 --> 00:53:19,080
know and so also what happens with with

1374
00:53:16,230 --> 00:53:24,150
Abraham well he's at home and these

1375
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:26,220
angels show up now we don't know whether

1376
00:53:24,150 --> 00:53:29,370
they're angels or men precisely because

1377
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:31,050
well as this part of the story reads as

1378
00:53:29,370 --> 00:53:33,210
the Lord appeared to him in the plains

1379
00:53:31,050 --> 00:53:35,280
of Mamre and he sat in the tent door in

1380
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:36,990
the heat of the day so he's not a

1381
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:38,820
visionary state by the by all

1382
00:53:36,990 --> 00:53:40,860
appearances and he lifted up his eyes

1383
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:42,780
and looked and lo three men stood by him

1384
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:45,210
there's real ambivalence in the story

1385
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:47,190
about the men are the three men are the

1386
00:53:45,210 --> 00:53:50,370
three angels are the two angels in God

1387
00:53:47,190 --> 00:53:52,140
it's all mixed up in the story so we

1388
00:53:50,370 --> 00:53:54,090
won't clarify that we'll leave it

1389
00:53:52,140 --> 00:53:55,950
ambiguous and I think the ambiguity is

1390
00:53:54,090 --> 00:53:58,310
important because you don't know who the

1391
00:53:55,950 --> 00:54:00,420
stranger is when you encounter them and

1392
00:53:58,310 --> 00:54:04,170
it depends on whether you're thinking

1393
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:05,040
about it in the normative manner or if

1394
00:54:04,170 --> 00:54:07,170
you're thinking about it in the

1395
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:08,850
transcendent manner because with each

1396
00:54:07,170 --> 00:54:10,590
person that you meet well they're just a

1397
00:54:08,850 --> 00:54:12,480
person that's one way of thinking about

1398
00:54:10,590 --> 00:54:15,450
it and and then they're the person that

1399
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:17,640
you know or they're the person as they

1400
00:54:15,450 --> 00:54:19,740
choose to reveal themselves to you and

1401
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:21,480
people keep themselves shielded but then

1402
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:24,480
they're also something of great

1403
00:54:21,480 --> 00:54:26,580
metaphysical potential right and you

1404
00:54:24,480 --> 00:54:29,370
might say well do you believe that and I

1405
00:54:26,580 --> 00:54:30,810
would say well yes you believe it

1406
00:54:29,370 --> 00:54:32,610
because you expect a lot from people

1407
00:54:30,810 --> 00:54:35,340
generally speaking and are not happy if

1408
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:37,080
they betray you but more importantly our

1409
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:39,660
entire culture is predicated on the idea

1410
00:54:37,080 --> 00:54:41,640
that each person has an indefinite

1411
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:43,670
intrinsic worth and I'm not talking

1412
00:54:41,640 --> 00:54:47,100
about self-esteem I'm talking about

1413
00:54:43,670 --> 00:54:49,830
something like the what would what would

1414
00:54:47,100 --> 00:54:52,020
you say it the implicit presupposition

1415
00:54:49,830 --> 00:54:53,790
in our legal structure that no matter

1416
00:54:52,020 --> 00:54:56,580
who you are even if you're a murderer

1417
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:58,590
even if you're a condemned murderer that

1418
00:54:56,580 --> 00:55:00,570
there's something about you that's of

1419
00:54:58,590 --> 00:55:02,610
transcendent value that has to be

1420
00:55:00,570 --> 00:55:04,530
respected by the law by the law and by

1421
00:55:02,610 --> 00:55:07,150
other people right and so that's that's

1422
00:55:04,530 --> 00:55:09,010
a remark net and you might say well

1423
00:55:07,150 --> 00:55:10,420
do I believe that and answer that is

1424
00:55:09,010 --> 00:55:12,700
well yak it out because you follow the

1425
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:14,050
law and it's not an easy thing to pull

1426
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:15,910
out of the law it's kind of the idea

1427
00:55:14,050 --> 00:55:18,370
that you have intrinsic natural rights

1428
00:55:15,910 --> 00:55:20,080
and you don't pull that out of our law

1429
00:55:18,370 --> 00:55:22,330
man without having the whole thing fall

1430
00:55:20,080 --> 00:55:23,830
down and I think the whole idea that you

1431
00:55:22,330 --> 00:55:25,780
have intrinsic natural rights is

1432
00:55:23,830 --> 00:55:29,560
predicated on something like the

1433
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:32,440
biblical hypothesis that human beings

1434
00:55:29,560 --> 00:55:34,930
have a logos nature and that we are

1435
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:38,920
involved in the speaking forth of being

1436
00:55:34,930 --> 00:55:40,870
and as beings who are involved in this

1437
00:55:38,920 --> 00:55:42,370
speaking forth of being there's

1438
00:55:40,870 --> 00:55:45,220
something about us that has to be

1439
00:55:42,370 --> 00:55:47,350
respected by ourselves

1440
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:48,730
in relationship to ourselves by

1441
00:55:47,350 --> 00:55:51,160
ourselves in relationship to other

1442
00:55:48,730 --> 00:55:53,380
people but even more strangely by

1443
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:55,900
ourselves in relationship to even to

1444
00:55:53,380 --> 00:55:57,700
criminals even to vicious criminals you

1445
00:55:55,900 --> 00:56:00,190
can't remove that transcendent element

1446
00:55:57,700 --> 00:56:02,260
and that's that to me that's also a

1447
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:04,030
mirror a miracle of conceptualization

1448
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:07,000
because who the hell is going to think

1449
00:56:04,030 --> 00:56:09,130
that up right even the most vicious of

1450
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:10,870
murderers has a touch of the

1451
00:56:09,130 --> 00:56:13,050
transcendent that needs to be respected

1452
00:56:10,870 --> 00:56:15,940
of all the ideas that are unlikely

1453
00:56:13,050 --> 00:56:17,650
that's going to top the list and of

1454
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:19,690
course without that you you have a very

1455
00:56:17,650 --> 00:56:21,640
barbaric legal system right because no

1456
00:56:19,690 --> 00:56:23,380
one is protected as soon as you make a

1457
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:25,360
mistake then you're in the Damned then

1458
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:26,830
you have no rights whatsoever and that

1459
00:56:25,360 --> 00:56:28,510
isn't what happens in the West which

1460
00:56:26,830 --> 00:56:30,390
isn't an absolutely amazing thing so

1461
00:56:28,510 --> 00:56:33,700
anyways

1462
00:56:30,390 --> 00:56:37,240
Abraham is a master of the stranger

1463
00:56:33,700 --> 00:56:40,090
that's one way of thinking about it he

1464
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:43,390
knows what to do when strangers come

1465
00:56:40,090 --> 00:56:45,850
along and he opens his he opens himself

1466
00:56:43,390 --> 00:56:48,340
up to them and I would say he does that

1467
00:56:45,850 --> 00:56:50,830
we know he's not a naive guy Abraham

1468
00:56:48,340 --> 00:56:53,440
right he's no weakling a couple of

1469
00:56:50,830 --> 00:56:55,450
stories ago he took a big army and you

1470
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:58,360
know went and harassed a bunch of Kings

1471
00:56:55,450 --> 00:56:58,990
and took his nephew back he's he's a

1472
00:56:58,360 --> 00:57:01,840
tough guy

1473
00:56:58,990 --> 00:57:04,750
and so if strangers show up and he

1474
00:57:01,840 --> 00:57:06,790
welcomes them it's not because he

1475
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:08,560
couldn't do otherwise he could certainly

1476
00:57:06,790 --> 00:57:10,540
do otherwise and it's not because he

1477
00:57:08,560 --> 00:57:12,340
isn't aware of what people can be like

1478
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:14,350
he's perfectly aware of what people can

1479
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:16,330
be like but he determines to take a

1480
00:57:14,350 --> 00:57:19,180
particular attitude towards them and

1481
00:57:16,330 --> 00:57:20,620
that is to welcome them and so and why

1482
00:57:19,180 --> 00:57:24,460
would you do that and I think

1483
00:57:20,620 --> 00:57:27,610
the answer to that is you hold out your

1484
00:57:24,460 --> 00:57:30,820
hand entrust to someone and you evoke

1485
00:57:27,610 --> 00:57:33,550
the best from them if that's their to be

1486
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:35,950
given so it's an act of courage it's

1487
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:39,010
like it's it isn't me meeting you

1488
00:57:35,950 --> 00:57:42,340
exactly not exactly it's more like the

1489
00:57:39,010 --> 00:57:44,260
transcendent part of me making a gesture

1490
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:46,270
that allows the transcendent part of you

1491
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:48,220
to step forward and that happens all the

1492
00:57:46,270 --> 00:57:50,500
time it happens all the time in

1493
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:52,540
normative discourse you know this

1494
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:54,130
perfectly well because sometimes you can

1495
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:55,510
have a real casual conversation with

1496
00:57:54,130 --> 00:57:57,970
someone that just goes nowhere right

1497
00:57:55,510 --> 00:57:59,680
it's just shallow as can be or now and

1498
00:57:57,970 --> 00:58:01,930
then you can actually make contact with

1499
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:03,580
someone right and you're both I would

1500
00:58:01,930 --> 00:58:05,740
say enlightened and ennoble by the

1501
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:08,440
conversation and that's a de we would

1502
00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:10,180
call that a deep conversation first for

1503
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:13,480
some reason because we made a deep

1504
00:58:10,180 --> 00:58:14,680
connection whatever that means it means

1505
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:16,690
well it certainly means that it's not

1506
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:18,670
shallow we're not sure about what these

1507
00:58:16,690 --> 00:58:20,110
metaphor means but it means that it

1508
00:58:18,670 --> 00:58:21,580
reaches deep inside of you it's

1509
00:58:20,110 --> 00:58:24,250
something like that you make direct

1510
00:58:21,580 --> 00:58:28,810
person-to-person contact and those sorts

1511
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:30,520
of conversations are replenishing that

1512
00:58:28,810 --> 00:58:32,290
that's the right way to think about it

1513
00:58:30,520 --> 00:58:35,830
they genuinely are and I think that's

1514
00:58:32,290 --> 00:58:38,410
because they provide you with that bread

1515
00:58:35,830 --> 00:58:40,840
that's not Material bread and that's the

1516
00:58:38,410 --> 00:58:44,320
information that you need to to thrive

1517
00:58:40,840 --> 00:58:45,970
and to put yourself together and so it

1518
00:58:44,320 --> 00:58:47,590
does matter how you meet someone and it

1519
00:58:45,970 --> 00:58:49,960
does matter how you treat them when you

1520
00:58:47,590 --> 00:58:51,640
first meet them and it's amazing I've

1521
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:53,230
learned to do this at least in part

1522
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:54,640
partly because I'm a clinical

1523
00:58:53,230 --> 00:58:56,620
psychologist I've learned how to talk to

1524
00:58:54,640 --> 00:58:58,600
people very rapidly and I have the most

1525
00:58:56,620 --> 00:59:00,970
amazing adventures with people in cabs

1526
00:58:58,600 --> 00:59:02,560
and when I travel because I'll talk to

1527
00:59:00,970 --> 00:59:04,540
them directly right away and they'll

1528
00:59:02,560 --> 00:59:06,400
tell me the wildest stories and show me

1529
00:59:04,540 --> 00:59:08,470
the craziest things because I'm actually

1530
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:11,260
interested in what they have to say and

1531
00:59:08,470 --> 00:59:13,780
I'm not afraid well I'm somewhat afraid

1532
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:16,210
but I'm not I'm not sufficiently afraid

1533
00:59:13,780 --> 00:59:20,170
to have that stop me and I'm acting on

1534
00:59:16,210 --> 00:59:21,850
the presupposition that the person has

1535
00:59:20,170 --> 00:59:24,100
something of great interest to reveal

1536
00:59:21,850 --> 00:59:25,780
and that's a very useful thing to know

1537
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:27,280
too because one of the things that's

1538
00:59:25,780 --> 00:59:28,870
really cool about people and you really

1539
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:30,040
learn this as the clinical psychologist

1540
00:59:28,870 --> 00:59:31,930
is that if you can get people talking

1541
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:33,130
they're so damn interesting you can

1542
00:59:31,930 --> 00:59:34,750
hardly stand it

1543
00:59:33,130 --> 00:59:36,850
you know because they have

1544
00:59:34,750 --> 00:59:38,530
these idiosyncratic experiences that are

1545
00:59:36,850 --> 00:59:40,090
only theirs right they're only theirs

1546
00:59:38,530 --> 00:59:41,620
personally no one else could tell the

1547
00:59:40,090 --> 00:59:43,240
story and that's the kind of stories

1548
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:44,500
that you want to hear and when they tell

1549
00:59:43,240 --> 00:59:46,540
you those stories you learn something

1550
00:59:44,500 --> 00:59:48,340
you didn't know and so what that means

1551
00:59:46,540 --> 00:59:51,670
is that you can treat the landscape of

1552
00:59:48,340 --> 00:59:54,280
strangers as an endless vista of places

1553
00:59:51,670 --> 00:59:55,930
to learn things you didn't know and if

1554
00:59:54,280 --> 00:59:58,840
you know enough so that you're satisfied

1555
00:59:55,930 --> 01:00:01,030
with your life and everything has ceased

1556
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:02,610
to be a tragedy around you well then you

1557
01:00:01,030 --> 01:00:06,130
could be comfortable in your

1558
01:00:02,610 --> 01:00:08,110
circumscribed domain of totalitarian

1559
01:00:06,130 --> 01:00:10,330
knowledge let's say but if you're if

1560
01:00:08,110 --> 01:00:11,860
your life is insufficient and you're

1561
01:00:10,330 --> 01:00:13,510
suffering more than you want to and

1562
01:00:11,860 --> 01:00:15,430
everything isn't what it should be then

1563
01:00:13,510 --> 01:00:18,100
you need to look where you haven't

1564
01:00:15,430 --> 01:00:20,020
looked for what you don't have and then

1565
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:21,640
you can look outside beyond you and then

1566
01:00:20,020 --> 01:00:24,820
you can make friends with what you don't

1567
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:26,710
understand and that's a huge part of

1568
01:00:24,820 --> 01:00:30,070
what this story is about because what

1569
01:00:26,710 --> 01:00:33,220
happens is that Abraham welcomes the men

1570
01:00:30,070 --> 01:00:35,380
God angels and treats them very well and

1571
01:00:33,220 --> 01:00:38,170
reaps a tremendous benefit as a

1572
01:00:35,380 --> 01:00:40,150
consequence and then well then the story

1573
01:00:38,170 --> 01:00:42,820
reverses and we end up in Sodom and

1574
01:00:40,150 --> 01:00:44,800
Gomorrah where the same angels sojourn

1575
01:00:42,820 --> 01:00:46,900
and they're treated terribly and all

1576
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:49,120
hell breaks loose and so that's what the

1577
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:50,980
story is about it's not fundamental now

1578
01:00:49,120 --> 01:00:53,290
there's a there's a sexual impropriety

1579
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:55,300
thing going on that I'm also going to

1580
01:00:53,290 --> 01:00:56,950
delve into but I don't think that's the

1581
01:00:55,300 --> 01:01:00,460
critical issue in the story the critical

1582
01:00:56,950 --> 01:01:03,250
issue in the story is how do you act in

1583
01:01:00,460 --> 01:01:04,360
the face of the stranger you know

1584
01:01:03,250 --> 01:01:08,590
there's a statement in the New Testament

1585
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:10,780
Christ says something like when you when

1586
01:01:08,590 --> 01:01:16,150
you do something to the least of people

1587
01:01:10,780 --> 01:01:19,630
you do it to me him right and that's a

1588
01:01:16,150 --> 01:01:21,570
very difficult statement to understand

1589
01:01:19,630 --> 01:01:26,890
too but it's something like it's

1590
01:01:21,570 --> 01:01:28,780
something reminiscent of the requirement

1591
01:01:26,890 --> 01:01:30,640
to keep the idea of the transcendent

1592
01:01:28,780 --> 01:01:32,410
reality of the person in mind at the

1593
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:35,380
same time you keep their proximal

1594
01:01:32,410 --> 01:01:37,900
reality in mind to have to have your

1595
01:01:35,380 --> 01:01:43,060
mind in two places at the same time when

1596
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:44,500
you're talking to people you know I

1597
01:01:43,060 --> 01:01:46,689
learned from a friend of mine in

1598
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:48,999
Montreal

1599
01:01:46,689 --> 01:01:50,829
who is very socially sophisticated in

1600
01:01:48,999 --> 01:01:52,900
some ways

1601
01:01:50,829 --> 01:01:54,429
whenever went in whenever he went in to

1602
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:58,029
us always like going shopping with him

1603
01:01:54,429 --> 01:02:00,309
and whenever he went into a store and he

1604
01:01:58,029 --> 01:02:02,049
talked and he had an interaction with a

1605
01:02:00,309 --> 01:02:03,849
clerk the first thing he would do is

1606
01:02:02,049 --> 01:02:05,559
have an interaction with the clerk and

1607
01:02:03,849 --> 01:02:08,170
he wouldn't have an interaction with the

1608
01:02:05,559 --> 01:02:10,089
role of the clerk he'd like look at the

1609
01:02:08,170 --> 01:02:11,709
person sort of take stock of the fact

1610
01:02:10,089 --> 01:02:14,949
that they were there and then asked them

1611
01:02:11,709 --> 01:02:17,160
something genuine about their job or

1612
01:02:14,949 --> 01:02:20,009
their store how they were doing like

1613
01:02:17,160 --> 01:02:22,239
going to a conversation right away and

1614
01:02:20,009 --> 01:02:23,679
he didn't get personal about it because

1615
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:26,589
that can be intrusive right you have to

1616
01:02:23,679 --> 01:02:30,489
be very sophisticated to do this but he

1617
01:02:26,589 --> 01:02:33,910
did indicate to the person that he was

1618
01:02:30,489 --> 01:02:35,469
there at least in part for the good that

1619
01:02:33,910 --> 01:02:37,420
could be done between them it's

1620
01:02:35,469 --> 01:02:40,299
something like that and then the person

1621
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:45,099
would be ridiculously helpful you know

1622
01:02:40,299 --> 01:02:46,420
and and so then you know if people

1623
01:02:45,099 --> 01:02:49,089
mistreat you you see this with

1624
01:02:46,420 --> 01:02:50,949
antisocial kids it's a very tragic thing

1625
01:02:49,089 --> 01:02:53,229
to see because if you're an antisocial

1626
01:02:50,949 --> 01:02:55,299
child by the time you're about 4 you're

1627
01:02:53,229 --> 01:02:57,519
very hostile and distrustful to people

1628
01:02:55,299 --> 01:03:00,069
and so you'd like a growling puppy and

1629
01:02:57,519 --> 01:03:01,749
if you're a growling puppy you can not

1630
01:03:00,069 --> 01:03:03,910
to get petted you're more likely to get

1631
01:03:01,749 --> 01:03:05,589
kicked and if you're a growling puppy

1632
01:03:03,910 --> 01:03:07,689
and you get kicked and you have even

1633
01:03:05,589 --> 01:03:09,459
more reason to grow and that's sort of

1634
01:03:07,689 --> 01:03:11,769
the story of antisocial kids if they're

1635
01:03:09,459 --> 01:03:13,059
not well socialized by the time they're

1636
01:03:11,769 --> 01:03:15,999
four and they're more on the aggressive

1637
01:03:13,059 --> 01:03:17,709
side then they alienate themselves from

1638
01:03:15,999 --> 01:03:20,049
the community and all they get is

1639
01:03:17,709 --> 01:03:23,709
rejection well and then they look at the

1640
01:03:20,049 --> 01:03:26,319
rejection and they think well to hell

1641
01:03:23,709 --> 01:03:28,660
with humanity you know and you wonder

1642
01:03:26,319 --> 01:03:31,449
they think that but but the part of the

1643
01:03:28,660 --> 01:03:34,029
catastrophe is is that they get what

1644
01:03:31,449 --> 01:03:35,859
they evoke and I'm not saying it's their

1645
01:03:34,029 --> 01:03:37,809
fault precisely but it doesn't matter

1646
01:03:35,859 --> 01:03:39,910
that's still what happens and so you

1647
01:03:37,809 --> 01:03:42,880
might ask yourself if you're not getting

1648
01:03:39,910 --> 01:03:45,489
from people what you need there is some

1649
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:46,869
possibility that you're not approaching

1650
01:03:45,489 --> 01:03:48,910
especially if this happens to you

1651
01:03:46,869 --> 01:03:50,920
repeatedly across people and this is a

1652
01:03:48,910 --> 01:03:52,689
virtual certainty if it happens to you

1653
01:03:50,920 --> 01:03:54,549
repeatedly across people especially if

1654
01:03:52,689 --> 01:03:57,999
you have the same bad experience with

1655
01:03:54,549 --> 01:03:59,950
people it's not them it's you I would

1656
01:03:57,999 --> 01:04:03,580
say three is the limit

1657
01:03:59,950 --> 01:04:05,200
if something happens to you once you

1658
01:04:03,580 --> 01:04:07,810
write it off if it happens to you twice

1659
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:09,670
it's like you open your eyes but you

1660
01:04:07,810 --> 01:04:14,530
write it off but it happens to you three

1661
01:04:09,670 --> 01:04:17,710
times it's probably you or it's the rest

1662
01:04:14,530 --> 01:04:19,030
of the world better it's you because

1663
01:04:17,710 --> 01:04:21,820
you're not going to change the rest of

1664
01:04:19,030 --> 01:04:23,830
the world and he lifted up his eyes and

1665
01:04:21,820 --> 01:04:25,150
looked and lo three men stood by heaven

1666
01:04:23,830 --> 01:04:27,220
when he saw them he ran to meet them

1667
01:04:25,150 --> 01:04:30,160
from the tent door and bowed himself to

1668
01:04:27,220 --> 01:04:31,870
the ground and said my lord if now I

1669
01:04:30,160 --> 01:04:33,790
have found favor in thy sight pass not

1670
01:04:31,870 --> 01:04:35,590
away I pray thee from thy servant let a

1671
01:04:33,790 --> 01:04:38,350
little water I pray you be fetched and

1672
01:04:35,590 --> 01:04:43,330
wash your feet wash your feet take the

1673
01:04:38,350 --> 01:04:49,690
dust from your feet extract yourself out

1674
01:04:43,330 --> 01:04:51,460
from your journey write and sit and I'll

1675
01:04:49,690 --> 01:04:53,320
fetch a morsel of bread and comfort ye

1676
01:04:51,460 --> 01:04:55,630
your hearts and after that you can pass

1677
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:57,970
on for therefore are you come to your

1678
01:04:55,630 --> 01:05:00,040
servant and they said so do as thou hath

1679
01:04:57,970 --> 01:05:02,320
said and Abraham hastened unto the tent

1680
01:05:00,040 --> 01:05:03,940
into the tent unto Sarah and said make

1681
01:05:02,320 --> 01:05:06,010
ready quickly three measures of fine

1682
01:05:03,940 --> 01:05:08,650
meal knead it and make cakes upon the

1683
01:05:06,010 --> 01:05:10,870
hearth powerful call to hospitality here

1684
01:05:08,650 --> 01:05:12,910
and abraham ran unto the herd and

1685
01:05:10,870 --> 01:05:14,980
fetched a calf tender and good and gave

1686
01:05:12,910 --> 01:05:17,320
it to a young man and he hasted to dress

1687
01:05:14,980 --> 01:05:18,730
it and he took butter and milk and the

1688
01:05:17,320 --> 01:05:20,260
calf which he had dressed and said it

1689
01:05:18,730 --> 01:05:23,580
before them and he stood by them under

1690
01:05:20,260 --> 01:05:23,580
the tree and they did eat some

1691
01:05:24,510 --> 01:05:31,540
commentary from here Hebrews 13 to be

1692
01:05:28,690 --> 01:05:33,220
not forgetful to entertain strangers for

1693
01:05:31,540 --> 01:05:36,640
thereby some have entertained angels

1694
01:05:33,220 --> 01:05:38,490
unawares this is a commentary from

1695
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:41,530
Matthew Henry with a nonconformist

1696
01:05:38,490 --> 01:05:43,510
minister and author cheerful and

1697
01:05:41,530 --> 01:05:46,210
obliging manners in showing kindness are

1698
01:05:43,510 --> 01:05:48,990
great ornaments to piety though our

1699
01:05:46,210 --> 01:05:52,930
condescending lord vouchsafe has not

1700
01:05:48,990 --> 01:05:54,910
personal visits to us yet still by his

1701
01:05:52,930 --> 01:05:56,350
Spirit he stands at the door knocks when

1702
01:05:54,910 --> 01:05:58,660
we're inclined to open he deigns to

1703
01:05:56,350 --> 01:06:00,610
enter by his gracious consolations he

1704
01:05:58,660 --> 01:06:04,720
provides a rich feast of which we

1705
01:06:00,610 --> 01:06:07,240
partake with him this is from

1706
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:09,100
revelations 3:20 behold I stand at the

1707
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:10,750
door and knock and If any man hear my

1708
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:12,880
voice and opened the door I will come in

1709
01:06:10,750 --> 01:06:17,170
to him and will sup with him and he

1710
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:20,200
with me well a hyperlink nature of those

1711
01:06:17,170 --> 01:06:22,299
quotes is quite obvious there's 10 or 15

1712
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:24,849
things being said at the same time right

1713
01:06:22,299 --> 01:06:26,650
one is a reference to the idea that if

1714
01:06:24,849 --> 01:06:28,210
you ask for something it will be given

1715
01:06:26,650 --> 01:06:31,119
to you right it was a very strange idea

1716
01:06:28,210 --> 01:06:33,940
but I like that idea a lot and I believe

1717
01:06:31,119 --> 01:06:36,970
my in my experience that has been true

1718
01:06:33,940 --> 01:06:38,529
if it was that I wanted what I was

1719
01:06:36,970 --> 01:06:41,259
asking for because that's the real issue

1720
01:06:38,529 --> 01:06:43,690
right because the question is if you

1721
01:06:41,259 --> 01:06:46,690
want something what does it mean to want

1722
01:06:43,690 --> 01:06:49,180
it and what it means is to sacrifice

1723
01:06:46,690 --> 01:06:51,549
whatever is necessary to get it because

1724
01:06:49,180 --> 01:06:53,980
otherwise you don't want it and so

1725
01:06:51,549 --> 01:06:56,200
there's an equation here and I'm not

1726
01:06:53,980 --> 01:06:59,019
claiming its ultimate accuracy but the

1727
01:06:56,200 --> 01:07:00,309
equation is something like you don't

1728
01:06:59,019 --> 01:07:03,009
want it unless you're willing to

1729
01:07:00,309 --> 01:07:04,539
sacrifice for it and if you don't want

1730
01:07:03,009 --> 01:07:08,200
it you're not going to get it because

1731
01:07:04,539 --> 01:07:10,619
you're scattered but if you do want it

1732
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:13,680
and you make the proper sacrifices then

1733
01:07:10,619 --> 01:07:16,329
god only knows what might happen and

1734
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:18,789
that's a see one of the things I really

1735
01:07:16,329 --> 01:07:21,910
like about the existential philosophers

1736
01:07:18,789 --> 01:07:23,740
is their emphasis on personal

1737
01:07:21,910 --> 01:07:26,619
responsibility you know that many of

1738
01:07:23,740 --> 01:07:29,440
them had an emphasis on the role that

1739
01:07:26,619 --> 01:07:31,720
people had in shaping their own destiny

1740
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:33,730
the exists for the existentialists and I

1741
01:07:31,720 --> 01:07:36,339
think this was a consequence of the

1742
01:07:33,730 --> 01:07:38,829
religious substructure of philosophical

1743
01:07:36,339 --> 01:07:43,029
thinking it was self-evident that life

1744
01:07:38,829 --> 01:07:45,039
was tragic and bitter but and then fair

1745
01:07:43,029 --> 01:07:47,619
enough but that isn't where it ended the

1746
01:07:45,039 --> 01:07:49,720
the next issue was well there are better

1747
01:07:47,619 --> 01:07:51,730
in ways better and worse ways of dealing

1748
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:53,710
with that and the better way of dealing

1749
01:07:51,730 --> 01:07:58,359
with the fact that life is tragic and

1750
01:07:53,710 --> 01:08:00,180
bitter is to pause it the self you could

1751
01:07:58,359 --> 01:08:03,369
be and live authentically in

1752
01:08:00,180 --> 01:08:05,019
relationship to that and then the next

1753
01:08:03,369 --> 01:08:06,670
issue and something is something

1754
01:08:05,019 --> 01:08:08,500
Kierkegaard talked about particularly

1755
01:08:06,670 --> 01:08:10,599
when he talked about the necessity of

1756
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:12,940
being a night of faith is that the thing

1757
01:08:10,599 --> 01:08:15,449
is and this is I think part of the light

1758
01:08:12,940 --> 01:08:18,250
part of life that's the intractable

1759
01:08:15,449 --> 01:08:20,650
adventure no one can take the adventure

1760
01:08:18,250 --> 01:08:22,839
of life away from you that that's they

1761
01:08:20,650 --> 01:08:24,940
can't deal with good advice for example

1762
01:08:22,839 --> 01:08:26,739
because no one can demonstrate to you

1763
01:08:24,940 --> 01:08:28,389
that if you straight

1764
01:08:26,739 --> 01:08:30,609
yourself out a name it what you want and

1765
01:08:28,389 --> 01:08:32,079
make the proper sacrifices that your

1766
01:08:30,609 --> 01:08:33,880
life will turn out in the manner that

1767
01:08:32,079 --> 01:08:36,880
you might want it to turn out

1768
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:39,069
it isn't in anyone else's purview to

1769
01:08:36,880 --> 01:08:42,670
make that judgment the only person that

1770
01:08:39,069 --> 01:08:44,440
can possibly figure that out is you it's

1771
01:08:42,670 --> 01:08:46,029
something that can't be stolen from you

1772
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:47,829
I would say it's your destiny it's a

1773
01:08:46,029 --> 01:08:50,679
destiny that cannot be stolen from you

1774
01:08:47,829 --> 01:08:51,940
and you can forego it you can say well

1775
01:08:50,679 --> 01:08:54,670
I'm not willing to put in the effort

1776
01:08:51,940 --> 01:08:56,199
because what if I fail well first of all

1777
01:08:54,670 --> 01:08:59,949
if you don't put in the effort you will

1778
01:08:56,199 --> 01:09:02,499
fail because life is hard and it takes

1779
01:08:59,949 --> 01:09:06,789
everything out of you to do it properly

1780
01:09:02,499 --> 01:09:08,920
so you will fail and if you make the

1781
01:09:06,789 --> 01:09:10,480
proper sacrifices you might fail that's

1782
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:11,670
why I like the ambiguity and the story

1783
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:14,319
of Cain and Abel because we're never

1784
01:09:11,670 --> 01:09:16,539
really told why God rejects Cain's

1785
01:09:14,319 --> 01:09:18,130
offerings there's hints that Cain maybe

1786
01:09:16,539 --> 01:09:19,659
isn't doing as good a job as he should

1787
01:09:18,130 --> 01:09:22,029
and he certainly gets bitter about it

1788
01:09:19,659 --> 01:09:23,920
but there's no smoking pistol

1789
01:09:22,029 --> 01:09:26,559
it doesn't say well Cain is a bad guy he

1790
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:27,849
made terrible sacrifices so God rejected

1791
01:09:26,559 --> 01:09:29,319
him you never know

1792
01:09:27,849 --> 01:09:30,880
Cain might have been working pretty damn

1793
01:09:29,319 --> 01:09:33,039
hard and things still didn't work out

1794
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:34,869
for them and I think that ambiguity is

1795
01:09:33,039 --> 01:09:38,380
appropriate in the story because that

1796
01:09:34,869 --> 01:09:40,929
imbued ambiguity is in life it you'd be

1797
01:09:38,380 --> 01:09:42,789
a fool to say that everything always

1798
01:09:40,929 --> 01:09:44,739
works out for everyone if they just do

1799
01:09:42,789 --> 01:09:47,019
things right I mean I think that's a

1800
01:09:44,739 --> 01:09:49,239
very that's a very careless thing to say

1801
01:09:47,019 --> 01:09:50,859
given how much tragedy and catastrophe

1802
01:09:49,239 --> 01:09:52,719
there is in the world and how much of it

1803
01:09:50,859 --> 01:09:55,590
seems to be undeserved but that still

1804
01:09:52,719 --> 01:09:58,749
has very little bearing I think on on

1805
01:09:55,590 --> 01:10:09,130
your own individual adventure and the

1806
01:09:58,749 --> 01:10:12,190
necessity for the necessity for opening

1807
01:10:09,130 --> 01:10:14,710
the door to who you could be and the

1808
01:10:12,190 --> 01:10:17,079
necessity to do that seriously and I do

1809
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:19,059
believe and I think I think that's why

1810
01:10:17,079 --> 01:10:21,249
this most impossible of verses you know

1811
01:10:19,059 --> 01:10:24,999
knock and the door will open

1812
01:10:21,249 --> 01:10:29,550
why that's believable is that I have

1813
01:10:24,999 --> 01:10:34,050
never met anyone who couldn't

1814
01:10:29,550 --> 01:10:36,429
hypothesize a better them in some manner

1815
01:10:34,050 --> 01:10:37,869
all they had to do was ask it's like

1816
01:10:36,429 --> 01:10:40,020
well how could you be better I think

1817
01:10:37,869 --> 01:10:41,160
well here's three ways it's like it's no

1818
01:10:40,020 --> 01:10:43,650
problem right you can think about that

1819
01:10:41,160 --> 01:10:45,840
no time cloud maybe it's small ways but

1820
01:10:43,650 --> 01:10:48,090
you can almost always at least think of

1821
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:50,460
something stupid that you're doing that

1822
01:10:48,090 --> 01:10:52,380
you could quit and so that means that

1823
01:10:50,460 --> 01:10:53,730
you do have this it's a strange thing in

1824
01:10:52,380 --> 01:10:56,250
people that we have this built-in

1825
01:10:53,730 --> 01:10:58,830
capacity to pause it a higher self and

1826
01:10:56,250 --> 01:11:00,390
then to move towards it and maybe maybe

1827
01:10:58,830 --> 01:11:02,820
that's part of where the religious

1828
01:11:00,390 --> 01:11:05,010
instinct really came from speaking like

1829
01:11:02,820 --> 01:11:06,510
really reductionistic ly like as a

1830
01:11:05,010 --> 01:11:08,790
materialist as an evolutionary

1831
01:11:06,510 --> 01:11:10,740
psychologist we we have this notion of

1832
01:11:08,790 --> 01:11:12,390
the transcendent ideal right that it

1833
01:11:10,740 --> 01:11:13,560
seems to be pervasive across cultures

1834
01:11:12,390 --> 01:11:16,470
well maybe that's the ultimate

1835
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:18,390
manifestation of the human proclivity to

1836
01:11:16,470 --> 01:11:20,580
be able to pause it an ideal at all and

1837
01:11:18,390 --> 01:11:23,370
to move forward you pause an ideal okay

1838
01:11:20,580 --> 01:11:25,290
that you need that to move forward well

1839
01:11:23,370 --> 01:11:25,890
if you can pause it an ideal why can't

1840
01:11:25,290 --> 01:11:28,140
you pause it

1841
01:11:25,890 --> 01:11:29,580
the ultimate ideal well if you can then

1842
01:11:28,140 --> 01:11:32,250
instantly you've got a religious

1843
01:11:29,580 --> 01:11:34,260
sensibility instantly and so maybe

1844
01:11:32,250 --> 01:11:36,270
that's the kind of puzzles like as a

1845
01:11:34,260 --> 01:11:38,850
biologist what the hell is the basis of

1846
01:11:36,270 --> 01:11:40,950
the religious instinct because the idea

1847
01:11:38,850 --> 01:11:43,020
that it's mere superstition like we can

1848
01:11:40,950 --> 01:11:45,420
just dispense with that that's wrong

1849
01:11:43,020 --> 01:11:47,190
it's a human Universal you can evoke

1850
01:11:45,420 --> 01:11:49,260
religious experiences all sorts of ways

1851
01:11:47,190 --> 01:11:50,970
so we're not going to play that game

1852
01:11:49,260 --> 01:11:53,670
there's there's some reason that that

1853
01:11:50,970 --> 01:11:55,410
instinct exists and this the first thing

1854
01:11:53,670 --> 01:11:57,570
to do with it is to try to reduce it to

1855
01:11:55,410 --> 01:11:57,840
something that's biological and leave it

1856
01:11:57,570 --> 01:12:00,060
at that

1857
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:01,980
not to mess with the metaphysics but it

1858
01:12:00,060 --> 01:12:03,870
certainly could be the case that it's

1859
01:12:01,980 --> 01:12:06,360
the ultimate extension of our capacity

1860
01:12:03,870 --> 01:12:09,870
to posit an ideal and we also might say

1861
01:12:06,360 --> 01:12:11,400
well that's good enough because well the

1862
01:12:09,870 --> 01:12:12,720
ideal moves you forward it fills your

1863
01:12:11,400 --> 01:12:14,700
life with meaning there's no doubt about

1864
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:16,230
that because it is in the movement

1865
01:12:14,700 --> 01:12:19,290
towards your ideal that life's meaning

1866
01:12:16,230 --> 01:12:21,000
is to be attained and then the question

1867
01:12:19,290 --> 01:12:23,070
is well how much meaning is there in

1868
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:24,810
moving forward towards an ultimate ideal

1869
01:12:23,070 --> 01:12:29,190
well more meaning even though it's more

1870
01:12:24,810 --> 01:12:33,300
difficult how much well that's the open

1871
01:12:29,190 --> 01:12:34,680
question behold I will stand at the door

1872
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:36,240
and knock and if any man hear my voice

1873
01:12:34,680 --> 01:12:37,950
and open the door I will come in to him

1874
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:42,510
and will sup with him and he with me

1875
01:12:37,950 --> 01:12:43,800
that's a pretty good deal and the angel

1876
01:12:42,510 --> 01:12:47,010
said unto Him where is Sarah thy wife

1877
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:49,260
and Abraham said Behold in the tent and

1878
01:12:47,010 --> 01:12:51,060
he said I will certainly return unto

1879
01:12:49,260 --> 01:12:53,790
thee according to the time of life and

1880
01:12:51,060 --> 01:12:55,920
lo Sarah thy wife

1881
01:12:53,790 --> 01:13:00,240
have a son and Sarah herded in the tent

1882
01:12:55,920 --> 01:13:01,890
door which was behind him now Abraham

1883
01:13:00,240 --> 01:13:04,110
and Sarah were old and well stricken in

1884
01:13:01,890 --> 01:13:06,180
age and it had ceased to be with Sarah

1885
01:13:04,110 --> 01:13:08,090
after the manner of women therefore

1886
01:13:06,180 --> 01:13:11,220
Sarah laughed within herself saying

1887
01:13:08,090 --> 01:13:13,580
after I am waxed old shall I also have

1888
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:16,620
this pleasure my lord being old also

1889
01:13:13,580 --> 01:13:19,800
well she's kind of skeptical about the

1890
01:13:16,620 --> 01:13:23,670
whole angel man God having a child at a

1891
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:29,400
hundred thing and and and and well write

1892
01:13:23,670 --> 01:13:31,950
and so rightly so and the Lord said unto

1893
01:13:29,400 --> 01:13:34,940
Abraham why did Sarah laugh saying shall

1894
01:13:31,950 --> 01:13:38,580
I've Asura T bear a child which I'm old

1895
01:13:34,940 --> 01:13:40,350
is anything too hard for the Lord at the

1896
01:13:38,580 --> 01:13:41,820
time appointed I will return unto thee

1897
01:13:40,350 --> 01:13:43,980
according to the time of life and Sarah

1898
01:13:41,820 --> 01:13:46,260
shall have a son then Sarah denied

1899
01:13:43,980 --> 01:13:58,490
saying I laughed not for she was afraid

1900
01:13:46,260 --> 01:14:00,960
and he said nay but thou didst laugh and

1901
01:13:58,490 --> 01:14:04,800
the men rose up from thence and looked

1902
01:14:00,960 --> 01:14:10,890
toward Sodom and Abraham went with them

1903
01:14:04,800 --> 01:14:12,510
to bring them on the way I'm gonna make

1904
01:14:10,890 --> 01:14:14,700
a small detour and talk to you about

1905
01:14:12,510 --> 01:14:16,470
this idea of potential again because

1906
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:18,930
it's really I've really thought about it

1907
01:14:16,470 --> 01:14:20,700
a lot I think music speaks of potential

1908
01:14:18,930 --> 01:14:22,530
like I think music speaks of potential

1909
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:23,940
bursting forward it's something it's

1910
01:14:22,530 --> 01:14:26,730
something like that and that's why it's

1911
01:14:23,940 --> 01:14:30,960
so deeply meaningful and and it's this

1912
01:14:26,730 --> 01:14:33,000
continual pattern revelation of the next

1913
01:14:30,960 --> 01:14:35,760
wonderful thing that might happen it's

1914
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:37,530
something like that so there's that and

1915
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:40,260
people find that deeply meaningful and

1916
01:14:37,530 --> 01:14:42,900
then there's the idea that we all have

1917
01:14:40,260 --> 01:14:45,240
potential that isn't realized but that

1918
01:14:42,900 --> 01:14:48,300
we regard that potential even though

1919
01:14:45,240 --> 01:14:49,530
it's not realized as real which I can't

1920
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:51,510
get my head around at all it just

1921
01:14:49,530 --> 01:14:54,030
doesn't make sense and then although

1922
01:14:51,510 --> 01:14:56,220
everyone acts that way and everyone

1923
01:14:54,030 --> 01:14:57,960
believes it because what you act

1924
01:14:56,220 --> 01:14:59,670
reflects what you believe and you make

1925
01:14:57,960 --> 01:15:01,470
judgments about yourself and others

1926
01:14:59,670 --> 01:15:03,840
based on those beliefs and their deep

1927
01:15:01,470 --> 01:15:05,370
judgments so the idea that you believe

1928
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:06,990
that there is such a thing as human

1929
01:15:05,370 --> 01:15:07,639
potential I think I think it's

1930
01:15:06,990 --> 01:15:09,919
undeniable

1931
01:15:07,639 --> 01:15:12,019
if you act at all if you expect things

1932
01:15:09,919 --> 01:15:13,789
of people at all then you're

1933
01:15:12,019 --> 01:15:15,619
demonstrating your commitment to the

1934
01:15:13,789 --> 01:15:16,999
idea of potential but then I wonder if

1935
01:15:15,619 --> 01:15:19,519
there's something even deeper going on

1936
01:15:16,999 --> 01:15:22,399
because we are very materialistic modern

1937
01:15:19,519 --> 01:15:24,739
people and there's great power in that

1938
01:15:22,399 --> 01:15:28,039
obviously I mean we've obtained great

1939
01:15:24,739 --> 01:15:30,860
control over the material world for

1940
01:15:28,039 --> 01:15:33,260
better or for worse but we do have a

1941
01:15:30,860 --> 01:15:35,090
tendency to think of the world purely as

1942
01:15:33,260 --> 01:15:36,860
a material structure and isn't really

1943
01:15:35,090 --> 01:15:39,800
obvious to me that the world is exactly

1944
01:15:36,860 --> 01:15:41,510
a material structure it seems to be to

1945
01:15:39,800 --> 01:15:44,989
be something more like constrained

1946
01:15:41,510 --> 01:15:47,119
potential you know because everything is

1947
01:15:44,989 --> 01:15:49,159
a certain way but everything that is a

1948
01:15:47,119 --> 01:15:50,479
certain way could be a multitude of

1949
01:15:49,159 --> 01:15:53,090
other ways in almost an infinite

1950
01:15:50,479 --> 01:15:54,769
multitude of other ways and the degree

1951
01:15:53,090 --> 01:15:56,929
to which something that is could be a

1952
01:15:54,769 --> 01:15:58,699
multitude of other ways is dependent a

1953
01:15:56,929 --> 01:16:00,679
large part on how you interact with it

1954
01:15:58,699 --> 01:16:01,669
right even with materials that we're

1955
01:16:00,679 --> 01:16:05,360
very familiar with

1956
01:16:01,669 --> 01:16:07,909
we continue to discover new properties

1957
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:10,429
and put them to use it's like things are

1958
01:16:07,909 --> 01:16:12,860
things are compacted into their material

1959
01:16:10,429 --> 01:16:15,079
form but that doesn't exhaust what they

1960
01:16:12,860 --> 01:16:17,899
are especially not in relationship to

1961
01:16:15,079 --> 01:16:19,939
other things and so it seems to me even

1962
01:16:17,899 --> 01:16:22,039
if you can't replace the materialist

1963
01:16:19,939 --> 01:16:23,919
perspective with the perspective that

1964
01:16:22,039 --> 01:16:26,030
it's better to construe the world

1965
01:16:23,919 --> 01:16:27,949
construe being as if it's made of

1966
01:16:26,030 --> 01:16:29,719
possibility rather than the world as if

1967
01:16:27,949 --> 01:16:32,179
it's made of matter it's at least useful

1968
01:16:29,719 --> 01:16:34,519
to have that as an additional viewpoint

1969
01:16:32,179 --> 01:16:36,320
is that because you could say well the

1970
01:16:34,519 --> 01:16:38,090
material philosophy is very useful as a

1971
01:16:36,320 --> 01:16:39,619
tool for obtaining certain sorts of

1972
01:16:38,090 --> 01:16:41,389
benefits which it clearly is

1973
01:16:39,619 --> 01:16:43,159
but then this more metaphysical

1974
01:16:41,389 --> 01:16:44,689
perspective which i think is more

1975
01:16:43,159 --> 01:16:47,179
accurate in some ways that the world is

1976
01:16:44,689 --> 01:16:48,979
a place of potential is also an

1977
01:16:47,179 --> 01:16:52,309
extraordinarily useful way to approach

1978
01:16:48,979 --> 01:16:54,679
the world and and it's practically

1979
01:16:52,309 --> 01:16:56,719
useful you know what we talked last week

1980
01:16:54,679 --> 01:16:59,510
a little bit about doing something as

1981
01:16:56,719 --> 01:17:01,340
simple as trying to organize a room it's

1982
01:16:59,510 --> 01:17:04,070
it's by no means obvious how much

1983
01:17:01,340 --> 01:17:06,409
potential there is in a room right

1984
01:17:04,070 --> 01:17:08,479
there's a very large amount of potential

1985
01:17:06,409 --> 01:17:09,739
in any given room tremendous amount of

1986
01:17:08,479 --> 01:17:11,599
potential especially if it's connected

1987
01:17:09,739 --> 01:17:14,090
with people I think maybe an

1988
01:17:11,599 --> 01:17:15,679
inexhaustible amount of potential and

1989
01:17:14,090 --> 01:17:17,360
maybe there's an inexhaustible amount of

1990
01:17:15,679 --> 01:17:19,880
potential everywhere and we just don't

1991
01:17:17,360 --> 01:17:21,269
know how to get access to it well that's

1992
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:23,129
certainly true

1993
01:17:21,269 --> 01:17:24,569
and it's certainly true to some degree

1994
01:17:23,129 --> 01:17:25,889
we don't know how to get access to all

1995
01:17:24,569 --> 01:17:27,749
the potential of our children for

1996
01:17:25,889 --> 01:17:32,329
example or ourselves or our loved ones

1997
01:17:27,749 --> 01:17:36,059
or it or or the people that we know so

1998
01:17:32,329 --> 01:17:39,349
well so I think the this story is trying

1999
01:17:36,059 --> 01:17:42,479
to hammer that idea home to which is

2000
01:17:39,349 --> 01:17:45,629
don't be so sure that it's impossible or

2001
01:17:42,479 --> 01:17:48,659
maybe don't let the assumption that's

2002
01:17:45,629 --> 01:17:50,549
it's impossible stop you from going

2003
01:17:48,659 --> 01:17:52,229
forth into the world that would be and

2004
01:17:50,549 --> 01:17:53,999
that's a that's a what would you say

2005
01:17:52,229 --> 01:17:56,939
that's like an inoculation against

2006
01:17:53,999 --> 01:17:58,889
nihilism and I'm for a long time I

2007
01:17:56,939 --> 01:18:01,219
understood nihilism very well I could I

2008
01:17:58,889 --> 01:18:03,119
could understand its rationale

2009
01:18:01,219 --> 01:18:05,419
associated with the tragedy of life

2010
01:18:03,119 --> 01:18:07,739
associating with suffering and evil

2011
01:18:05,419 --> 01:18:10,169
associated with the observation of

2012
01:18:07,739 --> 01:18:11,760
finitude and the arbitrary and unjust

2013
01:18:10,169 --> 01:18:14,189
nature of the world but the more I

2014
01:18:11,760 --> 01:18:15,749
thought about it the less I've come to

2015
01:18:14,189 --> 01:18:17,729
believe that there's any excuse for it

2016
01:18:15,749 --> 01:18:21,029
whatsoever and I think the reason for

2017
01:18:17,729 --> 01:18:24,209
that is that it forced all the effort it

2018
01:18:21,029 --> 01:18:27,389
four stalls the ability to discover for

2019
01:18:24,209 --> 01:18:29,879
yourself maybe there's no reason to be

2020
01:18:27,389 --> 01:18:32,339
so goddamn hopeless except that it's

2021
01:18:29,879 --> 01:18:35,339
easier to be useless now on a not

2022
01:18:32,339 --> 01:18:38,549
believe me I'm not making that case I'm

2023
01:18:35,339 --> 01:18:40,679
not saying that that's what's besetting

2024
01:18:38,549 --> 01:18:42,719
people who are clinically depressed for

2025
01:18:40,679 --> 01:18:44,369
example that's that's not my point

2026
01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:47,659
clinical depression is a terrible thing

2027
01:18:44,369 --> 01:18:50,760
there's lots of reasons to be rendered

2028
01:18:47,659 --> 01:18:52,949
to be to be tossed into a catastrophic

2029
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:55,709
condition that isn't what I mean I mean

2030
01:18:52,949 --> 01:18:58,409
that kind of cynical arrogant rational

2031
01:18:55,709 --> 01:19:01,349
hyper-intelligent nihilism that throws

2032
01:18:58,409 --> 01:19:05,359
the world away as if it's of little use

2033
01:19:01,349 --> 01:19:08,279
before it's been properly engaged with

2034
01:19:05,359 --> 01:19:09,539
better to engage with it and see what

2035
01:19:08,279 --> 01:19:10,859
happens and better to make the

2036
01:19:09,539 --> 01:19:13,439
assumption that if the world isn't

2037
01:19:10,859 --> 01:19:17,459
returning to you what it is that you

2038
01:19:13,439 --> 01:19:17,699
need then either you're not doing it

2039
01:19:17,459 --> 01:19:20,189
right

2040
01:19:17,699 --> 01:19:24,569
or you've conceptualized what you need

2041
01:19:20,189 --> 01:19:27,779
badly why not at least open yourself up

2042
01:19:24,569 --> 01:19:29,059
to that possibility right because you

2043
01:19:27,779 --> 01:19:31,260
could be wrong

2044
01:19:29,059 --> 01:19:34,169
hopefully if you're suffering this is a

2045
01:19:31,260 --> 01:19:35,040
great thing to know hopefully if you're

2046
01:19:34,169 --> 01:19:37,860
suffering you

2047
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:39,570
wrong because if you're suffering and

2048
01:19:37,860 --> 01:19:42,450
you're right then there's nowhere to go

2049
01:19:39,570 --> 01:19:44,460
so it's very useful to find out whatever

2050
01:19:42,450 --> 01:19:45,660
errors you might be committing another

2051
01:19:44,460 --> 01:19:47,520
thing that's really interesting about

2052
01:19:45,660 --> 01:19:50,250
the Jews in the Old Testament it's a

2053
01:19:47,520 --> 01:19:52,260
remarkable thing every single time they

2054
01:19:50,250 --> 01:19:58,200
get flattened by God it's always their

2055
01:19:52,260 --> 01:20:00,060
fault they never say the world that God

2056
01:19:58,200 --> 01:20:01,620
created was corrupt and God is evil they

2057
01:20:00,060 --> 01:20:03,900
never say that no matter what happens

2058
01:20:01,620 --> 01:20:06,480
right no matter what catastrophe occurs

2059
01:20:03,900 --> 01:20:09,270
when they have every reason to at least

2060
01:20:06,480 --> 01:20:14,220
put that hypothesis forward they don't

2061
01:20:09,270 --> 01:20:15,540
they say we erred we walked off the path

2062
01:20:14,220 --> 01:20:18,750
it's our fault

2063
01:20:15,540 --> 01:20:21,120
and that's hard you know because it puts

2064
01:20:18,750 --> 01:20:23,070
all the weight of human capacity on the

2065
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:27,540
human being that's very hard but the

2066
01:20:23,070 --> 01:20:29,520
outside is it gives you the control it

2067
01:20:27,540 --> 01:20:31,080
opens up the door that it opens up the

2068
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:32,970
possibility that you could be the person

2069
01:20:31,080 --> 01:20:35,300
that could set it right if you would

2070
01:20:32,970 --> 01:20:44,670
just let go of what's in your way

2071
01:20:35,300 --> 01:20:46,260
whatever that is and the men rose up

2072
01:20:44,670 --> 01:20:47,700
from thence and look towards Saul to man

2073
01:20:46,260 --> 01:20:52,590
Abraham went with them to bring them on

2074
01:20:47,700 --> 01:20:55,140
the way and the Lord said shall I hide

2075
01:20:52,590 --> 01:20:55,680
from Abraham that thing which I'm about

2076
01:20:55,140 --> 01:20:57,900
to do

2077
01:20:55,680 --> 01:20:59,280
seeing that Abraham shall surely become

2078
01:20:57,900 --> 01:21:01,530
a great mighty nation and all the

2079
01:20:59,280 --> 01:21:05,070
nations of the earth shall be blessed in

2080
01:21:01,530 --> 01:21:07,880
him I guess God is talking to himself

2081
01:21:05,070 --> 01:21:09,930
here or maybe he's talking to the angels

2082
01:21:07,880 --> 01:21:13,680
but I think he's trying to make a

2083
01:21:09,930 --> 01:21:15,210
decision for I know him that he will

2084
01:21:13,680 --> 01:21:17,970
command his children and his household

2085
01:21:15,210 --> 01:21:19,890
after him and they shall keep the way of

2086
01:21:17,970 --> 01:21:22,140
the Lord to do justice and judgment that

2087
01:21:19,890 --> 01:21:25,320
the Lord may bring upon Abraham that

2088
01:21:22,140 --> 01:21:29,370
which he has spoken of them and the Lord

2089
01:21:25,320 --> 01:21:31,590
said because the cry of Sodom and

2090
01:21:29,370 --> 01:21:34,910
Gomorrah is great and because their sin

2091
01:21:31,590 --> 01:21:36,600
is very Grievous I will go down now and

2092
01:21:34,910 --> 01:21:39,390
see whether they have done altogether

2093
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:44,520
according to the cry of it which has

2094
01:21:39,390 --> 01:21:46,050
come to me and if not I will know well

2095
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:47,460
we don't know what's happened in Sodom

2096
01:21:46,050 --> 01:21:48,810
and Gomorrah but we know that God's got

2097
01:21:47,460 --> 01:21:51,930
wind of it and that that's not

2098
01:21:48,810 --> 01:21:54,450
good and we know that sin means to miss

2099
01:21:51,930 --> 01:21:56,220
the mark and so we know that whatever

2100
01:21:54,450 --> 01:21:59,310
has happened in Sodom and Gomorrah means

2101
01:21:56,220 --> 01:22:01,200
that something about the natural ethical

2102
01:21:59,310 --> 01:22:04,890
order of things has been seriously

2103
01:22:01,200 --> 01:22:06,240
violated and there's a strong intimation

2104
01:22:04,890 --> 01:22:09,510
in the Old Testament which I think by

2105
01:22:06,240 --> 01:22:12,810
the way is completely correct that if

2106
01:22:09,510 --> 01:22:13,980
the proper order of being is violated

2107
01:22:12,810 --> 01:22:15,900
and that's something like the balance

2108
01:22:13,980 --> 01:22:20,220
between chaos and order say if the

2109
01:22:15,900 --> 01:22:23,310
proper balance of being is violated then

2110
01:22:20,220 --> 01:22:25,050
all hell will break loose and one of the

2111
01:22:23,310 --> 01:22:29,370
things I can tell you from reading a

2112
01:22:25,050 --> 01:22:31,800
very from reading a very comprehensive

2113
01:22:29,370 --> 01:22:33,840
set of myths from around the world is

2114
01:22:31,800 --> 01:22:37,860
that that's a conclusion that human

2115
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:40,290
beings have come to everywhere stay on

2116
01:22:37,860 --> 01:22:42,960
the goddamn path and be careful because

2117
01:22:40,290 --> 01:22:45,630
if you start to mess around and you

2118
01:22:42,960 --> 01:22:48,510
deviate especially if you know that

2119
01:22:45,630 --> 01:22:50,760
you're deviating things are not going to

2120
01:22:48,510 --> 01:22:52,800
go well for you and that idea is

2121
01:22:50,760 --> 01:22:54,270
everywhere and I think it's right I

2122
01:22:52,800 --> 01:22:55,620
think the idea is right because there

2123
01:22:54,270 --> 01:22:57,060
aren't that many ways of doing things

2124
01:22:55,620 --> 01:22:59,310
right and there's a lot of ways of doing

2125
01:22:57,060 --> 01:23:01,500
things wrong and if you do things wrong

2126
01:22:59,310 --> 01:23:03,690
the consequences of doing them wrong can

2127
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:06,390
be truly catastrophic you know one of

2128
01:23:03,690 --> 01:23:08,730
the things I learned from reading Viktor

2129
01:23:06,390 --> 01:23:10,770
Frankl first but then Alexander

2130
01:23:08,730 --> 01:23:13,680
Solzhenitsyn who I think did a deeper

2131
01:23:10,770 --> 01:23:17,550
job was that and vaclav havel thought

2132
01:23:13,680 --> 01:23:18,960
the same thing that these people were

2133
01:23:17,550 --> 01:23:21,180
very much trying to understand what

2134
01:23:18,960 --> 01:23:22,020
happened in places like Nazi Germany and

2135
01:23:21,180 --> 01:23:23,820
in the Soviet Union

2136
01:23:22,020 --> 01:23:26,400
so schnitzel school like our Capello's

2137
01:23:23,820 --> 01:23:27,930
caligo is a particularly good analysis

2138
01:23:26,400 --> 01:23:31,560
of what happened in the Soviet Union and

2139
01:23:27,930 --> 01:23:33,480
his conclusion and it's a 20 100 page

2140
01:23:31,560 --> 01:23:35,310
conclusion and it's like hammered home

2141
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:37,350
with a hammer it's it's a book that

2142
01:23:35,310 --> 01:23:39,510
everyone should read you know assuming

2143
01:23:37,350 --> 01:23:41,820
that you can read a 20 100 page screen

2144
01:23:39,510 --> 01:23:43,650
because that's basically what it is you

2145
01:23:41,820 --> 01:23:45,420
know first of all what he does is

2146
01:23:43,650 --> 01:23:47,520
document just how terrible things were

2147
01:23:45,420 --> 01:23:49,800
in the Soviet Union between 1919 and

2148
01:23:47,520 --> 01:23:51,690
1959 and no matter how terrible you

2149
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:53,640
think they were unless you know the

2150
01:23:51,690 --> 01:23:55,460
stories they were a lot more terrible

2151
01:23:53,640 --> 01:23:58,170
than that and they were terrible

2152
01:23:55,460 --> 01:24:01,950
personally because everyone lied they

2153
01:23:58,170 --> 01:24:02,760
were terrible in families because two

2154
01:24:01,950 --> 01:24:04,470
out of five

2155
01:24:02,760 --> 01:24:06,660
were government and farmers they were

2156
01:24:04,470 --> 01:24:08,070
terrible among friends because no one

2157
01:24:06,660 --> 01:24:09,750
could tell each other the truth they

2158
01:24:08,070 --> 01:24:11,550
were terrible socially because the whole

2159
01:24:09,750 --> 01:24:14,580
system was corrupted ban on slave labor

2160
01:24:11,550 --> 01:24:16,830
and they were terrible philosophically

2161
01:24:14,580 --> 01:24:18,900
because the doctrine of man upon which

2162
01:24:16,830 --> 01:24:22,340
the state was founded was hopeless and

2163
01:24:18,900 --> 01:24:26,580
nihilistic and and they were murderous

2164
01:24:22,340 --> 01:24:28,470
destructive and genocidal it's like they

2165
01:24:26,580 --> 01:24:32,040
got it wrong at every single level of

2166
01:24:28,470 --> 01:24:35,430
analysis simultaneously and the question

2167
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:37,140
is why and Solzhenitsyn's answer and to

2168
01:24:35,430 --> 01:24:39,120
some degree Victor Frankel's answer as

2169
01:24:37,140 --> 01:24:41,700
well and vaclav havel and I would say

2170
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:44,820
also Nelson Mandela and Gandhi they all

2171
01:24:41,700 --> 01:24:47,130
they all ended up in the same conceptual

2172
01:24:44,820 --> 01:24:49,620
sphere and the answer was because

2173
01:24:47,130 --> 01:24:52,380
individual people lived crooked lives

2174
01:24:49,620 --> 01:24:55,110
because individual people swallowed lies

2175
01:24:52,380 --> 01:24:57,810
and spoke them and didn't stand up for

2176
01:24:55,110 --> 01:24:59,970
the truth and the corruption that spread

2177
01:24:57,810 --> 01:25:02,490
from each individual pulled the entire

2178
01:24:59,970 --> 01:25:05,310
state mechanism into that corruption and

2179
01:25:02,490 --> 01:25:07,440
made everything into hell you know there

2180
01:25:05,310 --> 01:25:09,030
are other theories obedience right

2181
01:25:07,440 --> 01:25:11,790
that's kind of the Milgram idea from

2182
01:25:09,030 --> 01:25:13,920
that it's easy to make human beings OBD

2183
01:25:11,790 --> 01:25:15,660
obedient to people in authority and I've

2184
01:25:13,920 --> 01:25:17,490
explored that idea quite a bit with

2185
01:25:15,660 --> 01:25:19,430
regards to what happens happen for

2186
01:25:17,490 --> 01:25:22,770
example in the Nazi concentration camps

2187
01:25:19,430 --> 01:25:25,860
yes you can set circumstances up so that

2188
01:25:22,770 --> 01:25:28,020
people are likely to be obedient to

2189
01:25:25,860 --> 01:25:30,060
orders that are pathological there's no

2190
01:25:28,020 --> 01:25:31,560
doubt about that and yes sometimes

2191
01:25:30,060 --> 01:25:33,270
that's indicative of the weakness of

2192
01:25:31,560 --> 01:25:36,090
their character but that's not the issue

2193
01:25:33,270 --> 01:25:39,330
and the idea that what happened in Nazi

2194
01:25:36,090 --> 01:25:41,580
Germany was because a population of good

2195
01:25:39,330 --> 01:25:43,680
people listen to a tiny minority of bad

2196
01:25:41,580 --> 01:25:48,870
people that's a really that's really not

2197
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:51,120
a good theory the the the Nazi ethos was

2198
01:25:48,870 --> 01:25:53,430
there at every single level of the

2199
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:56,970
social organization right right from the

2200
01:25:53,430 --> 01:25:59,130
personal right from the personal right

2201
01:25:56,970 --> 01:26:00,810
from the familial all the way up to the

2202
01:25:59,130 --> 01:26:03,570
leadership it was the same thing all the

2203
01:26:00,810 --> 01:26:11,390
way up and all the way down and the same

2204
01:26:03,570 --> 01:26:13,719
thing in the Soviet Union and so well so

2205
01:26:11,390 --> 01:26:15,130
if you miss the

2206
01:26:13,719 --> 01:26:18,400
which is apparently what the people of

2207
01:26:15,130 --> 01:26:21,630
sodom and gomorrha did their sin was

2208
01:26:18,400 --> 01:26:25,510
Grievous than they risk destruction and

2209
01:26:21,630 --> 01:26:27,820
I just cannot see how after the 20th

2210
01:26:25,510 --> 01:26:32,199
century anyone with any sense could

2211
01:26:27,820 --> 01:26:33,699
possibly not see that as true and I

2212
01:26:32,199 --> 01:26:35,770
think that there's a line in the Old

2213
01:26:33,699 --> 01:26:38,890
Testament you know that the fear of God

2214
01:26:35,770 --> 01:26:39,940
is the beginning of wisdom and I can

2215
01:26:38,890 --> 01:26:43,600
tell you one of the things that

2216
01:26:39,940 --> 01:26:45,100
frightened me badly was the realization

2217
01:26:43,600 --> 01:26:46,270
from reading Souls nets and and a

2218
01:26:45,100 --> 01:26:48,060
variety of other things that I was

2219
01:26:46,270 --> 01:26:49,989
reading at the same time that

2220
01:26:48,060 --> 01:26:53,860
Dostoyevsky as well because he makes the

2221
01:26:49,989 --> 01:26:55,570
same point he said that a human being is

2222
01:26:53,860 --> 01:26:56,890
not only responsible for everything they

2223
01:26:55,570 --> 01:26:59,590
do but for everything that everyone else

2224
01:26:56,890 --> 01:27:01,239
does now you know that's crazy and he

2225
01:26:59,590 --> 01:27:02,260
was an epileptic and a mystic and that's

2226
01:27:01,239 --> 01:27:04,120
a crazy thing to say

2227
01:27:02,260 --> 01:27:06,040
but it's also there's something about it

2228
01:27:04,120 --> 01:27:07,930
that's true because if you were better

2229
01:27:06,040 --> 01:27:10,239
the people around you would be less

2230
01:27:07,930 --> 01:27:11,560
worse than they are and if you were good

2231
01:27:10,239 --> 01:27:14,320
enough you don't know how much better

2232
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:17,260
the people around you would be and so

2233
01:27:14,320 --> 01:27:19,870
there's this idea too you know that

2234
01:27:17,260 --> 01:27:22,449
Christ took the sins of the world unto

2235
01:27:19,870 --> 01:27:24,190
himself that's a complicated idea that I

2236
01:27:22,449 --> 01:27:25,930
wrestled with that one for a very long

2237
01:27:24,190 --> 01:27:27,100
time but I think I figured out at least

2238
01:27:25,930 --> 01:27:31,930
in part what it means

2239
01:27:27,100 --> 01:27:35,050
it meant that it's something like the

2240
01:27:31,930 --> 01:27:37,060
realization of complete humanity you see

2241
01:27:35,050 --> 01:27:41,320
to take the sins of the world unto

2242
01:27:37,060 --> 01:27:43,900
yourself is to realize that is to

2243
01:27:41,320 --> 01:27:47,140
understand the Nazi concentration camp

2244
01:27:43,900 --> 01:27:51,520
guard because that person is human and

2245
01:27:47,140 --> 01:27:54,160
so are you and so if you can't see you

2246
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:58,030
in that then you don't know who you are

2247
01:27:54,160 --> 01:27:59,320
and if you can see you in that well then

2248
01:27:58,030 --> 01:28:01,000
you've started to take the sins of the

2249
01:27:59,320 --> 01:28:02,860
world onto yourself because you've

2250
01:28:01,000 --> 01:28:04,660
actually started to take responsibility

2251
01:28:02,860 --> 01:28:08,170
for those terrible things you know I

2252
01:28:04,660 --> 01:28:12,910
think it's the motif of the the motto of

2253
01:28:08,170 --> 01:28:15,940
the Holocaust Museum in Washington we

2254
01:28:12,910 --> 01:28:18,550
must never forget that's close and I

2255
01:28:15,940 --> 01:28:20,080
think well you can't forgive you can't

2256
01:28:18,550 --> 01:28:21,760
remember what you don't understand you

2257
01:28:20,080 --> 01:28:23,380
will forget what you don't understand

2258
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:27,090
and the question is what are you

2259
01:28:23,380 --> 01:28:27,090
supposed to remember about the Holocaust

2260
01:28:27,489 --> 01:28:32,679
historical event that six million people

2261
01:28:30,249 --> 01:28:35,050
died that's not what's to remember

2262
01:28:32,679 --> 01:28:37,960
what's to remember is that's what people

2263
01:28:35,050 --> 01:28:41,170
can do and you're one of them

2264
01:28:37,960 --> 01:28:43,269
and if you don't understand that you

2265
01:28:41,170 --> 01:28:45,420
could do that then you don't know who

2266
01:28:43,269 --> 01:28:45,420
you are

2267
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:59,290
so God's making a case here he's making

2268
01:28:56,800 --> 01:29:01,690
a case that the people of the Sodom and

2269
01:28:59,290 --> 01:29:03,700
Gomorrha have sinned and it's making a

2270
01:29:01,690 --> 01:29:06,010
large racket that even God has heard

2271
01:29:03,700 --> 01:29:09,160
about that's a very common mythological

2272
01:29:06,010 --> 01:29:13,690
motif by the way that the sins and and

2273
01:29:09,160 --> 01:29:16,330
and and what would you call it the sins

2274
01:29:13,690 --> 01:29:18,550
and noise of humanity can read such a

2275
01:29:16,330 --> 01:29:20,350
clamor that even the gods hearin and are

2276
01:29:18,550 --> 01:29:22,380
forced to intervene that comes all the

2277
01:29:20,350 --> 01:29:25,390
way from the Mesopotamian creation story

2278
01:29:22,380 --> 01:29:27,970
so anyways it's logical yeah their

2279
01:29:25,390 --> 01:29:30,340
sinning okay well so what well no not so

2280
01:29:27,970 --> 01:29:32,680
what it means that God's offended and

2281
01:29:30,340 --> 01:29:34,480
that everything is at risk that's what

2282
01:29:32,680 --> 01:29:38,410
it means it's like that's a something

2283
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:39,760
worth taking seriously and the men

2284
01:29:38,410 --> 01:29:42,070
turned their faces from thence and went

2285
01:29:39,760 --> 01:29:44,110
towards Sodom but Abraham stood yet

2286
01:29:42,070 --> 01:29:46,600
before the Lord and Abraham drew near

2287
01:29:44,110 --> 01:29:49,510
and said will thou also destroy the

2288
01:29:46,600 --> 01:29:53,170
righteous with the wicked this is a very

2289
01:29:49,510 --> 01:29:54,610
interesting part of the story um friend

2290
01:29:53,170 --> 01:29:57,490
of mine took me to task the other day

2291
01:29:54,610 --> 01:29:59,290
when I was writing about portraying the

2292
01:29:57,490 --> 01:30:01,090
Old Testament God is pretty harsh and

2293
01:29:59,290 --> 01:30:03,100
judgmental and the New Testament God is

2294
01:30:01,090 --> 01:30:04,090
sort of all loving which he isn't

2295
01:30:03,100 --> 01:30:07,750
because there's the whole Book of

2296
01:30:04,090 --> 01:30:09,540
Revelations thing but um but I got that

2297
01:30:07,750 --> 01:30:11,590
partly from reading Northrop Frye but

2298
01:30:09,540 --> 01:30:13,680
going through the Old Testament more

2299
01:30:11,590 --> 01:30:16,960
detail I realized that that's that is

2300
01:30:13,680 --> 01:30:19,690
too low resolution interpretation and

2301
01:30:16,960 --> 01:30:22,180
that God who's dispensing a fair bit of

2302
01:30:19,690 --> 01:30:23,950
harsh justice in the Old Testament it's

2303
01:30:22,180 --> 01:30:26,170
also someone who can be negotiated with

2304
01:30:23,950 --> 01:30:26,590
weirdly enough and that's what happens

2305
01:30:26,170 --> 01:30:28,960
here

2306
01:30:26,590 --> 01:30:30,670
you know Abraham has just been told that

2307
01:30:28,960 --> 01:30:32,410
whatever's going on in Sodom and

2308
01:30:30,670 --> 01:30:33,850
Gomorrah is seriously not good and that

2309
01:30:32,410 --> 01:30:36,040
God's going to do something about it and

2310
01:30:33,850 --> 01:30:39,550
he takes it upon himself this is an act

2311
01:30:36,040 --> 01:30:41,470
of mercy to to ask God to be a bit more

2312
01:30:39,550 --> 01:30:43,120
judicious right it's like okay you're

2313
01:30:41,470 --> 01:30:44,500
gonna wipe out the city well bad things

2314
01:30:43,120 --> 01:30:46,330
are happening there but you know there's

2315
01:30:44,500 --> 01:30:48,670
probably a few people in the damn city

2316
01:30:46,330 --> 01:30:49,810
that aren't completely corrupted by

2317
01:30:48,670 --> 01:30:51,940
what's going on there

2318
01:30:49,810 --> 01:30:53,230
of course that's an open question you

2319
01:30:51,940 --> 01:30:54,910
know because it's an open question for

2320
01:30:53,230 --> 01:30:56,470
example how many people were there were

2321
01:30:54,910 --> 01:30:58,210
in Nazi Germany who weren't completely

2322
01:30:56,470 --> 01:30:59,950
corrupted by what was going on in Nazi

2323
01:30:58,210 --> 01:31:01,960
Germany and the same thing could be said

2324
01:30:59,950 --> 01:31:03,580
about Mallis China and the same thing

2325
01:31:01,960 --> 01:31:05,920
could be said about the Soviet Union

2326
01:31:03,580 --> 01:31:07,540
it's like well perhaps there was a

2327
01:31:05,920 --> 01:31:09,310
person somewhere who didn't

2328
01:31:07,540 --> 01:31:12,160
and at some level what was happening but

2329
01:31:09,310 --> 01:31:13,840
you know the whole issue of willful

2330
01:31:12,160 --> 01:31:14,500
blindness certainly springs to mind if

2331
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:16,900
nothing else

2332
01:31:14,500 --> 01:31:20,800
anyways Abraham decides to intercede

2333
01:31:16,900 --> 01:31:23,170
with God on behalf of these people who

2334
01:31:20,800 --> 01:31:24,970
are going to be destroyed he says will

2335
01:31:23,170 --> 01:31:28,450
thou also destroy the righteous with the

2336
01:31:24,970 --> 01:31:30,190
wicked perhaps there be 50 righteous

2337
01:31:28,450 --> 01:31:32,110
people within the city will you also

2338
01:31:30,190 --> 01:31:35,350
destroy and not spare the place for the

2339
01:31:32,110 --> 01:31:37,120
fifty righteous that are there that be

2340
01:31:35,350 --> 01:31:38,650
far from thee to do after this manner

2341
01:31:37,120 --> 01:31:40,810
he's kind of reminding God that he's a

2342
01:31:38,650 --> 01:31:42,850
good guy as far as I can tell to slay

2343
01:31:40,810 --> 01:31:44,020
the righteous with the wicked and that

2344
01:31:42,850 --> 01:31:45,880
the righteous should be as the wicked

2345
01:31:44,020 --> 01:31:48,970
thought before from thee should not the

2346
01:31:45,880 --> 01:31:51,040
judge of the earth do right and the Lord

2347
01:31:48,970 --> 01:31:53,470
said if I find in Sodom fifty right he

2348
01:31:51,040 --> 01:31:55,330
seems a bit taken aback here to me if I

2349
01:31:53,470 --> 01:31:57,040
find him Sodom 50 righteous within the

2350
01:31:55,330 --> 01:31:59,080
city then I will spare the place for

2351
01:31:57,040 --> 01:32:01,120
their sakes and Abraham answered and

2352
01:31:59,080 --> 01:32:03,100
said behold now I have taken upon me to

2353
01:32:01,120 --> 01:32:07,330
speak upon the Lord unto the Lord which

2354
01:32:03,100 --> 01:32:10,000
but I am but dust in ashes possibly

2355
01:32:07,330 --> 01:32:12,400
there shall lack five of the fifty

2356
01:32:10,000 --> 01:32:15,790
righteous will thou destroy all the city

2357
01:32:12,400 --> 01:32:18,370
for lack of five and he said he said God

2358
01:32:15,790 --> 01:32:20,680
said if I find there forty five I will

2359
01:32:18,370 --> 01:32:22,810
not destroy it and Abraham spoke unto

2360
01:32:20,680 --> 01:32:25,750
him yet again and said he's kind of

2361
01:32:22,810 --> 01:32:27,340
sneaking up on God here huh her

2362
01:32:25,750 --> 01:32:29,230
adventure there shall be forty found

2363
01:32:27,340 --> 01:32:33,180
there and he said I will not do it for

2364
01:32:29,230 --> 01:32:36,510
forty sake and he said unto him oh let

2365
01:32:33,180 --> 01:32:39,550
the Lord not be angry and I will speak

2366
01:32:36,510 --> 01:32:41,710
possibly there shall be thirty found

2367
01:32:39,550 --> 01:32:44,830
there and God said I won't do it if I

2368
01:32:41,710 --> 01:32:46,480
find thirty there and Abraham he seems

2369
01:32:44,830 --> 01:32:49,540
really to be pushing his luck by this

2370
01:32:46,480 --> 01:32:51,340
point says behold I have taken upon me

2371
01:32:49,540 --> 01:32:53,440
to speak under the Lord possibly there

2372
01:32:51,340 --> 01:32:57,640
shall be twenty found there and God said

2373
01:32:53,440 --> 01:33:01,750
I won't destroy it for 20s sake and he

2374
01:32:57,640 --> 01:33:04,660
said oh let the Lord not be angry and I

2375
01:33:01,750 --> 01:33:06,700
will speak yet but this once perhaps ten

2376
01:33:04,660 --> 01:33:09,760
shall be found there and he said I will

2377
01:33:06,700 --> 01:33:11,350
not destroy it for 10s sake and the Lord

2378
01:33:09,760 --> 01:33:12,910
went his way and as soon as he had left

2379
01:33:11,350 --> 01:33:15,310
communing with Abraham and Abraham

2380
01:33:12,910 --> 01:33:16,870
returned unto his place well there's two

2381
01:33:15,310 --> 01:33:20,680
ways you can read that part of the story

2382
01:33:16,870 --> 01:33:21,519
one is that three let's say you can

2383
01:33:20,680 --> 01:33:23,349
bargain with God

2384
01:33:21,519 --> 01:33:24,760
even if you're kind of annoying about it

2385
01:33:23,349 --> 01:33:29,499
so that's kind of interesting

2386
01:33:24,760 --> 01:33:31,690
the second is that even if there's a

2387
01:33:29,499 --> 01:33:33,659
minority of good in a place that isn't

2388
01:33:31,690 --> 01:33:36,519
good it won't be slated for destruction

2389
01:33:33,659 --> 01:33:40,059
that's kind of a good thing and the

2390
01:33:36,519 --> 01:33:42,880
third is a minority of good in a place

2391
01:33:40,059 --> 01:33:44,559
can keep it from being destroyed and

2392
01:33:42,880 --> 01:33:48,190
that's a really good thing too and I

2393
01:33:44,559 --> 01:33:51,309
believe that as well I think that good

2394
01:33:48,190 --> 01:33:53,440
is more powerful than evil naivety isn't

2395
01:33:51,309 --> 01:33:56,789
but I think that good is and I think

2396
01:33:53,440 --> 01:33:58,960
that in a place that's corrupt a

2397
01:33:56,789 --> 01:34:04,079
minority of people who stand forth

2398
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:04,079
against the corruption can prevail now

2399
01:34:07,079 --> 01:34:11,980
you know I think I think one of the best

2400
01:34:09,519 --> 01:34:14,019
examples of that again was all Alexander

2401
01:34:11,980 --> 01:34:16,059
Solzhenitsyn because he was in the

2402
01:34:14,019 --> 01:34:18,159
terrible work camps when he wrote his

2403
01:34:16,059 --> 01:34:20,050
book he memorized most of it which is

2404
01:34:18,159 --> 01:34:22,690
not an easy thing to do when it's 2,100

2405
01:34:20,050 --> 01:34:25,599
pages long and set in very tiny font he

2406
01:34:22,690 --> 01:34:28,869
memorized most of it and then he wrote

2407
01:34:25,599 --> 01:34:30,489
it and it was one of the things that

2408
01:34:28,869 --> 01:34:32,219
brought down the Soviet Union you know

2409
01:34:30,489 --> 01:34:35,199
was published in the 1970s

2410
01:34:32,219 --> 01:34:37,869
first of all in wet in the West and the

2411
01:34:35,199 --> 01:34:43,690
first thing that happened at least

2412
01:34:37,869 --> 01:34:45,400
initially was that the communism as an

2413
01:34:43,690 --> 01:34:47,349
ethical system lost absolutely all

2414
01:34:45,400 --> 01:34:49,690
credibility whatsoever among anyone who

2415
01:34:47,349 --> 01:34:50,949
was even vaguely educated immediately

2416
01:34:49,690 --> 01:34:53,619
upon the publication of The Gulag

2417
01:34:50,949 --> 01:34:55,630
Archipelago he pulled the moral slats

2418
01:34:53,619 --> 01:34:57,519
out from underneath it and the book was

2419
01:34:55,630 --> 01:34:58,869
definitely one of the reasons there were

2420
01:34:57,519 --> 01:35:01,809
many but was definitely one of the

2421
01:34:58,869 --> 01:35:04,630
reasons why the rotten system crumbled

2422
01:35:01,809 --> 01:35:07,659
and fell without a war and that's a

2423
01:35:04,630 --> 01:35:11,980
great example of how one person can take

2424
01:35:07,659 --> 01:35:13,630
on a tyranny and prevail so and he's not

2425
01:35:11,980 --> 01:35:15,039
the only person who did that sort of

2426
01:35:13,630 --> 01:35:16,659
thing because well Gandhi did the same

2427
01:35:15,039 --> 01:35:19,719
thing I mean I don't think the English

2428
01:35:16,659 --> 01:35:22,449
were the Russians but you know things

2429
01:35:19,719 --> 01:35:24,219
were not so good in India and what

2430
01:35:22,449 --> 01:35:30,460
Gandhi did in India under the influence

2431
01:35:24,219 --> 01:35:32,170
by the way of Leo Tolstoy was also a

2432
01:35:30,460 --> 01:35:34,600
remarkable example of a single person

2433
01:35:32,170 --> 01:35:36,640
intervening in a catastrophe and and

2434
01:35:34,600 --> 01:35:43,090
and and setting it far more right than

2435
01:35:36,640 --> 01:35:45,610
it could be so and there came two angels

2436
01:35:43,090 --> 01:35:48,400
to sought him and evening and lot

2437
01:35:45,610 --> 01:35:50,020
remember Lauda's Abraham's nephew sat in

2438
01:35:48,400 --> 01:35:51,160
the gate of Sodom and laud seeing them

2439
01:35:50,020 --> 01:35:53,200
rose up to meet them and he bowed

2440
01:35:51,160 --> 01:35:56,440
himself with his face toward the ground

2441
01:35:53,200 --> 01:35:58,360
and he said Behold my Lords I turn in I

2442
01:35:56,440 --> 01:36:00,130
pray you into your servants house and

2443
01:35:58,360 --> 01:36:01,780
tarry all night and wash your feet and

2444
01:36:00,130 --> 01:36:02,220
ye shall rise up early and go on your

2445
01:36:01,780 --> 01:36:05,710
ways

2446
01:36:02,220 --> 01:36:07,360
no he's Abraham's nephew and can spend

2447
01:36:05,710 --> 01:36:09,640
acting in exactly the manner that

2448
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:11,920
Abraham does he shows hospitality to

2449
01:36:09,640 --> 01:36:15,190
these people and they said no no we'll

2450
01:36:11,920 --> 01:36:17,500
stay in the street all night and he

2451
01:36:15,190 --> 01:36:19,360
insisted he pressed upon them greatly

2452
01:36:17,500 --> 01:36:20,800
and they turned in unto him and entered

2453
01:36:19,360 --> 01:36:23,260
into his house and he made them a feast

2454
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:25,120
and baked unleavened bread and they did

2455
01:36:23,260 --> 01:36:27,160
eat but before they lay down the men of

2456
01:36:25,120 --> 01:36:28,840
the city even the men of Sodom compassed

2457
01:36:27,160 --> 01:36:31,690
the house round both old and young all

2458
01:36:28,840 --> 01:36:33,040
the people from every quarter and they

2459
01:36:31,690 --> 01:36:34,810
called him to Lord and said unto him

2460
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:35,200
where the man which came into thee this

2461
01:36:34,810 --> 01:36:37,570
night

2462
01:36:35,200 --> 01:36:44,080
bring them out to us that we may know

2463
01:36:37,570 --> 01:36:48,640
them well that's the part of the story

2464
01:36:44,080 --> 01:36:51,400
that's been used as a diatribe let's say

2465
01:36:48,640 --> 01:36:56,430
against homosexuality because to know is

2466
01:36:51,400 --> 01:36:59,170
to engage in sexual intercourse and the

2467
01:36:56,430 --> 01:37:01,540
inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah we're

2468
01:36:59,170 --> 01:37:04,810
willing to care the strangers out of

2469
01:37:01,540 --> 01:37:07,480
Lots house and use and abuse them as

2470
01:37:04,810 --> 01:37:09,190
they see self fit right and so what are

2471
01:37:07,480 --> 01:37:11,350
they doing well they're violating the

2472
01:37:09,190 --> 01:37:12,970
principle the principles that govern

2473
01:37:11,350 --> 01:37:15,100
appropriate conduct with the stranger

2474
01:37:12,970 --> 01:37:17,110
and maybe the stranger is something you

2475
01:37:15,100 --> 01:37:18,310
shouldn't mess with because you don't

2476
01:37:17,110 --> 01:37:20,740
know who you're messing with

2477
01:37:18,310 --> 01:37:22,240
so that's like warning number one well

2478
01:37:20,740 --> 01:37:24,220
they're violets are under violating the

2479
01:37:22,240 --> 01:37:26,650
essential principles of hospitality and

2480
01:37:24,220 --> 01:37:30,880
then there's the sexual thing here I

2481
01:37:26,650 --> 01:37:33,940
think is isn't the sexual thing here is

2482
01:37:30,880 --> 01:37:36,250
something more like the absolute danger

2483
01:37:33,940 --> 01:37:39,460
of immediate gratification sexual

2484
01:37:36,250 --> 01:37:42,100
included outside the constraints of any

2485
01:37:39,460 --> 01:37:43,480
civilized structure whatsoever right

2486
01:37:42,100 --> 01:37:45,040
because that's his uncivilized behavior

2487
01:37:43,480 --> 01:37:48,429
as you could possibly hope for

2488
01:37:45,040 --> 01:37:50,500
right strangers come into your city

2489
01:37:48,429 --> 01:37:52,120
they're in the house of someone who's

2490
01:37:50,500 --> 01:37:56,409
part of your city they're being shown

2491
01:37:52,120 --> 01:37:58,600
hospitality a mob shows up and says four

2492
01:37:56,409 --> 01:38:01,270
come over man we're going to do whatever

2493
01:37:58,600 --> 01:38:03,250
the hell we want to them and it's not

2494
01:38:01,270 --> 01:38:05,409
going to be good and if you get in the

2495
01:38:03,250 --> 01:38:11,409
way things are going to go even worse

2496
01:38:05,409 --> 01:38:13,390
for you so so that's what it seems to me

2497
01:38:11,409 --> 01:38:17,340
to be it's completely dysregulated

2498
01:38:13,390 --> 01:38:20,920
behavior its behavior that's outside the

2499
01:38:17,340 --> 01:38:22,780
confines of any civilized structure

2500
01:38:20,920 --> 01:38:25,449
whatsoever it's an indica it's an

2501
01:38:22,780 --> 01:38:27,670
indication that the entire the social

2502
01:38:25,449 --> 01:38:29,980
structure of the entire society has

2503
01:38:27,670 --> 01:38:33,310
collapsed so that there's nothing left

2504
01:38:29,980 --> 01:38:35,739
for the inhabitants to do except to

2505
01:38:33,310 --> 01:38:41,440
engage in the most brutal of immediate

2506
01:38:35,739 --> 01:38:45,400
gratification and destruction well so

2507
01:38:41,440 --> 01:38:47,469
what does Lott do I pray thee brethren

2508
01:38:45,400 --> 01:38:49,090
do not do so wickedly behold now I have

2509
01:38:47,469 --> 01:38:51,850
two daughters which have not yet known

2510
01:38:49,090 --> 01:38:54,070
man let me I pray you bring them out

2511
01:38:51,850 --> 01:38:55,750
unto you and you do to them as is good

2512
01:38:54,070 --> 01:38:58,989
in your eyes only unto these men do

2513
01:38:55,750 --> 01:39:01,590
nothing and therefore for therefore came

2514
01:38:58,989 --> 01:39:04,480
they the under the shadow of my roof

2515
01:39:01,590 --> 01:39:06,699
well it's hard to know what to make of

2516
01:39:04,480 --> 01:39:12,520
that you know I mean doesn't exactly

2517
01:39:06,699 --> 01:39:18,190
seem like the advisable thing for a lot

2518
01:39:12,520 --> 01:39:20,199
to do and but I think at least what it

2519
01:39:18,190 --> 01:39:24,640
is is an indication of the degree to

2520
01:39:20,199 --> 01:39:27,850
which he took the solemn vow of

2521
01:39:24,640 --> 01:39:30,480
hospitality seriously and I think that's

2522
01:39:27,850 --> 01:39:33,480
the idea that the story is trying to

2523
01:39:30,480 --> 01:39:33,480
promote

2524
01:39:36,010 --> 01:39:41,440
and the angel said stand back oh and the

2525
01:39:38,950 --> 01:39:43,810
men said stand back and they said again

2526
01:39:41,440 --> 01:39:45,580
this one fellow came in to sojourn to

2527
01:39:43,810 --> 01:39:46,239
talk to us and he will need to be a

2528
01:39:45,580 --> 01:39:48,489
judge

2529
01:39:46,239 --> 01:39:50,800
now we'll deal worse with him than with

2530
01:39:48,489 --> 01:39:52,630
them and they press sore upon the man

2531
01:39:50,800 --> 01:39:55,150
even law and came near to break the door

2532
01:39:52,630 --> 01:39:58,750
maybe what lot thought was something

2533
01:39:55,150 --> 01:40:03,400
like well we're done like we're all done

2534
01:39:58,750 --> 01:40:08,050
but this mob and perhaps I can spare

2535
01:40:03,400 --> 01:40:09,850
some of us and they press sore upon the

2536
01:40:08,050 --> 01:40:13,690
man even Lawton came near to break the

2537
01:40:09,850 --> 01:40:15,070
door but the man this is the angels put

2538
01:40:13,690 --> 01:40:16,390
forth their hand and pulled a lot into

2539
01:40:15,070 --> 01:40:17,470
the house to them and shut the door and

2540
01:40:16,390 --> 01:40:19,120
they smote the men that were out the

2541
01:40:17,470 --> 01:40:21,160
door of the house with blindness both

2542
01:40:19,120 --> 01:40:25,090
small and great so that they wearied

2543
01:40:21,160 --> 01:40:26,860
themselves to find the door so they were

2544
01:40:25,090 --> 01:40:29,500
so corrupt that they were blind and

2545
01:40:26,860 --> 01:40:32,739
could not see now even to find the door

2546
01:40:29,500 --> 01:40:35,260
and the man men said unto lot hast thou

2547
01:40:32,739 --> 01:40:36,670
here any besides any family members son

2548
01:40:35,260 --> 01:40:39,790
in law and thy sons and thy daughters

2549
01:40:36,670 --> 01:40:41,380
and whoever thou hast in the city get

2550
01:40:39,790 --> 01:40:43,810
them out of the place for we will

2551
01:40:41,380 --> 01:40:45,730
destroy this place because of the cry of

2552
01:40:43,810 --> 01:40:47,830
them is waxing great before the face of

2553
01:40:45,730 --> 01:40:51,910
the Lord and the Lord has sent us to

2554
01:40:47,830 --> 01:40:55,300
destroy it and lot went out and spake

2555
01:40:51,910 --> 01:40:57,700
unto his sons in law which married his

2556
01:40:55,300 --> 01:40:59,500
daughters and said up you get out of

2557
01:40:57,700 --> 01:41:01,930
this place for the Lord will destroy the

2558
01:40:59,500 --> 01:41:05,020
city but he seemed as one that marked

2559
01:41:01,930 --> 01:41:07,150
unto his son and sons-in-law when in the

2560
01:41:05,020 --> 01:41:09,610
morning arose than the angels hastened

2561
01:41:07,150 --> 01:41:11,410
blood saying arise take thy way for

2562
01:41:09,610 --> 01:41:13,270
ninety daughters which are here lest

2563
01:41:11,410 --> 01:41:18,489
thou be consumed in the iniquity of the

2564
01:41:13,270 --> 01:41:20,200
city and while he lingered lingered the

2565
01:41:18,489 --> 01:41:21,790
man laid hold upon his hands and upon

2566
01:41:20,200 --> 01:41:23,620
the hand of his wife and upon the hand

2567
01:41:21,790 --> 01:41:25,090
of his two daughters the Lord being

2568
01:41:23,620 --> 01:41:29,130
merciful unto them and they brought him

2569
01:41:25,090 --> 01:41:32,530
forth and seven without the city so he

2570
01:41:29,130 --> 01:41:35,410
still this is an indication of the

2571
01:41:32,530 --> 01:41:37,840
danger of not acting with appropriate

2572
01:41:35,410 --> 01:41:39,760
haste when the time has come I mean law

2573
01:41:37,840 --> 01:41:41,800
it's already seen what happened he saw

2574
01:41:39,760 --> 01:41:44,920
that the men came to his door he saw

2575
01:41:41,800 --> 01:41:47,410
that they were murderous rapists he saw

2576
01:41:44,920 --> 01:41:49,770
that the angels took them out and he

2577
01:41:47,410 --> 01:41:49,770
still

2578
01:41:49,780 --> 01:41:55,150
isn't to leave that place and so I guess

2579
01:41:53,650 --> 01:41:59,739
one of the things that this story

2580
01:41:55,150 --> 01:42:02,110
requires people to ask themselves is are

2581
01:41:59,739 --> 01:42:05,530
you in a place that's so bad that you

2582
01:42:02,110 --> 01:42:07,420
should leave or when are you in a place

2583
01:42:05,530 --> 01:42:09,460
that's so bad that you should leave and

2584
01:42:07,420 --> 01:42:11,230
if you are in a place that's so bad that

2585
01:42:09,460 --> 01:42:16,230
you should leave then the time to leave

2586
01:42:11,230 --> 01:42:18,250
is now because there's no time to waste

2587
01:42:16,230 --> 01:42:19,659
and it came to pass when they had

2588
01:42:18,250 --> 01:42:21,699
brought them forth abroad that he said

2589
01:42:19,659 --> 01:42:22,710
escape for their life look not behind

2590
01:42:21,699 --> 01:42:24,969
you

2591
01:42:22,710 --> 01:42:26,469
neither stay thou in all the plain

2592
01:42:24,969 --> 01:42:29,860
escape to the mountain lest thou be

2593
01:42:26,469 --> 01:42:33,099
consumed and Lord said to them oh not

2594
01:42:29,860 --> 01:42:34,420
not so my lord behold now they serve and

2595
01:42:33,099 --> 01:42:36,489
have found grace in my sight and now

2596
01:42:34,420 --> 01:42:38,079
have magnified thy mercy which thou has

2597
01:42:36,489 --> 01:42:40,210
showed me into saving my life

2598
01:42:38,079 --> 01:42:42,909
but I cannot escape to the mountain lest

2599
01:42:40,210 --> 01:42:45,130
some evil take me and I die behold now

2600
01:42:42,909 --> 01:42:47,139
there's a city near to flee unto and

2601
01:42:45,130 --> 01:42:48,699
it's a little one which means maybe it's

2602
01:42:47,139 --> 01:42:50,949
not big and corrupt like Sodom and

2603
01:42:48,699 --> 01:42:52,510
Gomorrah oh let me escape thither is it

2604
01:42:50,949 --> 01:42:55,239
is it not a little one and my soul shall

2605
01:42:52,510 --> 01:42:57,460
live Matthew Henry said Lord linger he

2606
01:42:55,239 --> 01:42:59,079
trifled thus many who are under

2607
01:42:57,460 --> 01:43:00,969
convictions about the spiritual state

2608
01:42:59,079 --> 01:43:07,210
and the necessity of a change defer that

2609
01:43:00,969 --> 01:43:09,429
needful work and he said unto him see

2610
01:43:07,210 --> 01:43:11,139
I've accepted the angel and he said unto

2611
01:43:09,429 --> 01:43:12,250
him see I have accepted the concerning

2612
01:43:11,139 --> 01:43:13,929
this thing also that I will not

2613
01:43:12,250 --> 01:43:16,210
overthrow this city for the which thou

2614
01:43:13,929 --> 01:43:18,309
has spoken the small City hasty escape

2615
01:43:16,210 --> 01:43:20,949
thither for I cannot do anything to thou

2616
01:43:18,309 --> 01:43:22,900
be gone hither therefore the name of the

2617
01:43:20,949 --> 01:43:24,460
city was or that's where Lord went the

2618
01:43:22,900 --> 01:43:27,190
Sun was risen upon the earth when Lord

2619
01:43:24,460 --> 01:43:28,989
entered into Zoar then the Lord rained

2620
01:43:27,190 --> 01:43:31,119
upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone

2621
01:43:28,989 --> 01:43:33,219
and fire from the Lord out of heaven and

2622
01:43:31,119 --> 01:43:34,690
he overthrew the cities and all the

2623
01:43:33,219 --> 01:43:36,429
plain and all the inhabitants of the

2624
01:43:34,690 --> 01:43:39,369
cities and that which grew up on the

2625
01:43:36,429 --> 01:43:41,920
ground but his wife looked back from

2626
01:43:39,369 --> 01:43:44,280
behind him and she became a pillar of

2627
01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:44,280
salt

2628
01:43:46,650 --> 01:43:52,869
no nostalgia for catastrophe I think

2629
01:43:50,829 --> 01:43:57,070
that's what that means is that when you

2630
01:43:52,869 --> 01:43:59,530
leave what's not good you wash the dust

2631
01:43:57,070 --> 01:44:04,469
off your feet and you don't look back

2632
01:43:59,530 --> 01:44:04,469
and that's a very harsh lesson

2633
01:44:05,679 --> 01:44:11,689
this is echoed a bit in the New

2634
01:44:07,669 --> 01:44:13,129
Testament the idea of the necessity for

2635
01:44:11,689 --> 01:44:16,099
immediate action these are some of the

2636
01:44:13,129 --> 01:44:18,499
harsher words that Christ said this is

2637
01:44:16,099 --> 01:44:23,089
from Matthew 8 Christ is addressing a

2638
01:44:18,499 --> 01:44:25,549
multitude and asking people to follow

2639
01:44:23,089 --> 01:44:28,159
him and a disciple comes up to him and

2640
01:44:25,549 --> 01:44:30,469
says Lord suffer me first to go and bury

2641
01:44:28,159 --> 01:44:32,449
my father seems like a perfectly

2642
01:44:30,469 --> 01:44:34,999
reasonable request but jesus said unto

2643
01:44:32,449 --> 01:44:41,179
him follow me and let the dead bury

2644
01:44:34,999 --> 01:44:42,949
their dead this is from Matthew 12 well

2645
01:44:41,179 --> 01:44:44,689
he had talked to the people behold his

2646
01:44:42,949 --> 01:44:46,699
mother and his brethren stood without

2647
01:44:44,689 --> 01:44:49,369
desiring to speak with him and one said

2648
01:44:46,699 --> 01:44:51,319
to him behold thy mother and my brethren

2649
01:44:49,369 --> 01:44:53,869
stand without desiring to speak with

2650
01:44:51,319 --> 01:44:55,489
thee but jesus answered the one who was

2651
01:44:53,869 --> 01:45:00,169
telling him and said who is my mother

2652
01:44:55,489 --> 01:45:01,999
and who is my brothers for whosoever

2653
01:45:00,169 --> 01:45:04,099
shall do the will of my father which is

2654
01:45:01,999 --> 01:45:07,309
in heaven the same as my brother and

2655
01:45:04,099 --> 01:45:09,579
sister and mother well what does all

2656
01:45:07,309 --> 01:45:09,579
that mean

2657
01:45:10,479 --> 01:45:14,959
it means that there's no excuses

2658
01:45:13,069 --> 01:45:17,649
whatsoever for not getting up and

2659
01:45:14,959 --> 01:45:23,719
getting at it that's what it means and

2660
01:45:17,649 --> 01:45:26,029
it means that it even means that when

2661
01:45:23,719 --> 01:45:29,089
people are beset with a catastrophe like

2662
01:45:26,029 --> 01:45:30,969
let's say the death of their father that

2663
01:45:29,089 --> 01:45:33,109
they are prone to use that as an excuse

2664
01:45:30,969 --> 01:45:35,269
for not going about the business that

2665
01:45:33,109 --> 01:45:37,249
they should be going about because they

2666
01:45:35,269 --> 01:45:40,549
can say to themselves well I would

2667
01:45:37,249 --> 01:45:42,199
accept and accept there's always good

2668
01:45:40,549 --> 01:45:43,429
reasons I mean believe me there's always

2669
01:45:42,199 --> 01:45:45,859
good reasons for not doing what you

2670
01:45:43,429 --> 01:45:47,839
should that's for sure the reasons pile

2671
01:45:45,859 --> 01:45:49,669
up day after day to not do what you

2672
01:45:47,839 --> 01:45:51,169
should especially because you're you're

2673
01:45:49,669 --> 01:45:52,969
aiming at things in the future you can

2674
01:45:51,169 --> 01:45:55,999
put them off and definitely right

2675
01:45:52,969 --> 01:45:58,549
because of the demands of the day but

2676
01:45:55,999 --> 01:46:00,139
these stories they say a variety of

2677
01:45:58,549 --> 01:46:02,479
things you know in especially in

2678
01:46:00,139 --> 01:46:04,039
combination they say when you leave

2679
01:46:02,479 --> 01:46:07,399
somewhere terrible do not look back

2680
01:46:04,039 --> 01:46:11,379
there's no nostalgia that's that's the

2681
01:46:07,399 --> 01:46:14,479
letting the dead parts of yourself go

2682
01:46:11,379 --> 01:46:16,159
and then if you're going to follow the

2683
01:46:14,479 --> 01:46:16,760
good there's no excuse not to do it and

2684
01:46:16,159 --> 01:46:19,369
that

2685
01:46:16,760 --> 01:46:21,289
it means no excuse whatsoever under any

2686
01:46:19,369 --> 01:46:22,760
circumstances and then it's taken even

2687
01:46:21,289 --> 01:46:25,070
farther with regards to familiar

2688
01:46:22,760 --> 01:46:28,250
relationships it is you can't even let

2689
01:46:25,070 --> 01:46:30,170
them stand in your way and I think

2690
01:46:28,250 --> 01:46:32,179
that's all true and I think I've seen

2691
01:46:30,170 --> 01:46:35,119
virtually all of that in my clinical

2692
01:46:32,179 --> 01:46:39,500
practice like there's no excuse

2693
01:46:35,119 --> 01:46:41,900
whatsoever for not getting at what it is

2694
01:46:39,500 --> 01:46:43,639
that you should be doing and I think

2695
01:46:41,900 --> 01:46:45,019
there's something else that's going on

2696
01:46:43,639 --> 01:46:47,300
here especially in the New Testament

2697
01:46:45,019 --> 01:46:49,420
stories which is even made may be worse

2698
01:46:47,300 --> 01:46:52,579
which is it's absolutely reprehensible

2699
01:46:49,420 --> 01:46:55,159
to justify you're in action with a

2700
01:46:52,579 --> 01:46:57,349
catastrophe that extracts mercy from

2701
01:46:55,159 --> 01:46:59,539
other people right there's a tricky

2702
01:46:57,349 --> 01:47:01,130
tricky game that's going well of course

2703
01:46:59,539 --> 01:47:02,510
I can't do that look at the terrible

2704
01:47:01,130 --> 01:47:03,170
thing that's just happened to me it's

2705
01:47:02,510 --> 01:47:05,510
yeah okay

2706
01:47:03,170 --> 01:47:07,340
I understand you're absolved of any

2707
01:47:05,510 --> 01:47:10,099
necessity to move forward because of

2708
01:47:07,340 --> 01:47:12,769
your current catastrophe it's like well

2709
01:47:10,099 --> 01:47:14,989
actually you're not and it's rather rude

2710
01:47:12,769 --> 01:47:18,889
of you to use it as an excuse and it's

2711
01:47:14,989 --> 01:47:20,360
certainly counterproductive and Abraham

2712
01:47:18,889 --> 01:47:21,829
got up early in the morning to the place

2713
01:47:20,360 --> 01:47:23,420
where he stood before the Lord and he

2714
01:47:21,829 --> 01:47:25,280
looked towards Sodom and Gomorrah and

2715
01:47:23,420 --> 01:47:28,730
toward the land of the plain and behold

2716
01:47:25,280 --> 01:47:34,159
and lo the smoke of the country went up

2717
01:47:28,730 --> 01:47:35,719
as a smoke of a furnace and it came to

2718
01:47:34,159 --> 01:47:37,730
pass when God destroyed the cities of

2719
01:47:35,719 --> 01:47:39,260
the plain that God remembered Abraham

2720
01:47:37,730 --> 01:47:41,059
and sent lot out of the midst of the

2721
01:47:39,260 --> 01:47:43,489
overthrow when he overthrew the cities

2722
01:47:41,059 --> 01:47:45,260
in the which lot dwelt and lot went out

2723
01:47:43,489 --> 01:47:46,519
of Zoar and dwelt in the mountain and

2724
01:47:45,260 --> 01:47:48,769
his two daughters with them for he

2725
01:47:46,519 --> 01:47:50,239
feeler feared to dwell and Zoar and he

2726
01:47:48,769 --> 01:47:52,880
dwelt in a cave he and his two daughters

2727
01:47:50,239 --> 01:47:56,000
and the firstborn said unto the younger

2728
01:47:52,880 --> 01:47:57,829
our Father is all and there's not a man

2729
01:47:56,000 --> 01:47:59,630
in the earth to come in to us after the

2730
01:47:57,829 --> 01:48:01,250
manner of all the earth come let us make

2731
01:47:59,630 --> 01:48:03,289
our father drink wine and we will lie

2732
01:48:01,250 --> 01:48:06,440
with him that we may preserve the seed

2733
01:48:03,289 --> 01:48:07,940
of our father and they made their father

2734
01:48:06,440 --> 01:48:09,679
drink wine that night and the firstborn

2735
01:48:07,940 --> 01:48:12,050
went in and lay with her father and he

2736
01:48:09,679 --> 01:48:14,599
perceived not when she lay down nor when

2737
01:48:12,050 --> 01:48:16,190
she arose and it came to pass on the

2738
01:48:14,599 --> 01:48:18,469
morrow that the firstborn said unto the

2739
01:48:16,190 --> 01:48:20,750
younger behold i lay yesternight with my

2740
01:48:18,469 --> 01:48:22,670
father let us make him drink wine this

2741
01:48:20,750 --> 01:48:24,559
night also and gold out in and lie with

2742
01:48:22,670 --> 01:48:26,900
him that we may preserve seed of our

2743
01:48:24,559 --> 01:48:28,789
father and they made their father drink

2744
01:48:26,900 --> 01:48:30,290
wine that night also and the younger

2745
01:48:28,789 --> 01:48:32,600
arose and lay with him

2746
01:48:30,290 --> 01:48:35,000
perceived not when she lay down nor when

2747
01:48:32,600 --> 01:48:41,330
she arose thus were both the daughters

2748
01:48:35,000 --> 01:48:44,540
of log with child by their father well

2749
01:48:41,330 --> 01:48:46,940
it's like the story you know the story

2750
01:48:44,540 --> 01:48:49,820
is outlined the catastrophe of sodom and

2751
01:48:46,940 --> 01:48:52,400
gomorrah essentially the ethical

2752
01:48:49,820 --> 01:48:54,680
catastrophe of sodom and gomorrah the

2753
01:48:52,400 --> 01:48:57,130
dissolution of the civilized constraints

2754
01:48:54,680 --> 01:48:59,270
that should regulate all behavior and

2755
01:48:57,130 --> 01:49:00,950
then the city is destroyed but there's

2756
01:48:59,270 --> 01:49:04,090
an echo of it afterwards right because

2757
01:49:00,950 --> 01:49:07,910
laud had lived in sodom and gomorrah and

2758
01:49:04,090 --> 01:49:10,160
what happens to him even after his

2759
01:49:07,910 --> 01:49:14,030
escapes is that he gets tangled into an

2760
01:49:10,160 --> 01:49:17,030
incestuous web and so I think that

2761
01:49:14,030 --> 01:49:18,710
that's a it's not foreshadow its post

2762
01:49:17,030 --> 01:49:22,730
shadowing if there's such a thing it's

2763
01:49:18,710 --> 01:49:26,480
an echo of what it's an echo and a

2764
01:49:22,730 --> 01:49:28,280
reminder of how terrible whatever it was

2765
01:49:26,480 --> 01:49:31,490
that was happening in Sodom and Gomorrah

2766
01:49:28,280 --> 01:49:42,140
was that even after escaping the

2767
01:49:31,490 --> 01:49:45,140
iniquity still remained well that's a

2768
01:49:42,140 --> 01:49:47,720
pretty good place to stop we got through

2769
01:49:45,140 --> 01:49:48,560
two of three stories so that's not too

2770
01:49:47,720 --> 01:49:50,960
bad next week

2771
01:49:48,560 --> 01:49:53,330
I'll talk about the sacrifice of Isaac

2772
01:49:50,960 --> 01:49:54,800
and see if I can get into the next

2773
01:49:53,330 --> 01:49:58,580
stories as well and next week is the

2774
01:49:54,800 --> 01:50:01,220
last lecture except I talked to the

2775
01:49:58,580 --> 01:50:03,170
theater people and it looks like I'll be

2776
01:50:01,220 --> 01:50:05,840
able to rent the theater once a month at

2777
01:50:03,170 --> 01:50:07,490
least for the next four months so I'm

2778
01:50:05,840 --> 01:50:09,680
going to do that and I'll announce when

2779
01:50:07,490 --> 01:50:12,170
I'm going to do that and I'll continue

2780
01:50:09,680 --> 01:50:14,260
doing this probably as long as you'll

2781
01:50:12,170 --> 01:50:23,169
continue to come and listen

2782
01:50:14,260 --> 01:50:23,169
[Applause]

2783
01:50:23,800 --> 01:50:26,939
[Music]

2784
01:50:29,800 --> 01:50:38,829
I could tell you something cool that

2785
01:50:33,880 --> 01:50:42,489
happened to if you want so some of you

2786
01:50:38,829 --> 01:50:46,949
may know that there was a memo leaked at

2787
01:50:42,489 --> 01:50:53,889
Google how many of you know about that

2788
01:50:46,949 --> 01:50:56,820
Wow law to you so a colleague of the man

2789
01:50:53,889 --> 01:50:59,469
who released the memo got ahold of me

2790
01:50:56,820 --> 01:51:03,969
yesterday and said that the man who

2791
01:50:59,469 --> 01:51:06,579
wrote the memo wanted to talk to me so I

2792
01:51:03,969 --> 01:51:08,820
interviewed him today I made a YouTube

2793
01:51:06,579 --> 01:51:11,500
video out of it we went over his memo

2794
01:51:08,820 --> 01:51:13,780
which was scientifically accurate in my

2795
01:51:11,500 --> 01:51:16,329
estimation and so I'm going to release

2796
01:51:13,780 --> 01:51:18,540
that hopefully tonight so we'll see how

2797
01:51:16,329 --> 01:51:18,540
that goes

2798
01:51:24,400 --> 01:51:30,020
he got fired last night eh right he got

2799
01:51:27,920 --> 01:51:33,260
fired for perpetuating gender

2800
01:51:30,020 --> 01:51:35,810
stereotypes he told me today that his

2801
01:51:33,260 --> 01:51:39,380
last performance review he had been

2802
01:51:35,810 --> 01:51:42,290
given superb which is the top few

2803
01:51:39,380 --> 01:51:45,800
percentiles of the employee distribution

2804
01:51:42,290 --> 01:51:48,620
at Google right perpetuating gender

2805
01:51:45,800 --> 01:51:50,780
stereotypes I went through his document

2806
01:51:48,620 --> 01:51:53,360
I don't think he said a single thing

2807
01:51:50,780 --> 01:51:55,610
that wasn't substantiated by a fairly

2808
01:51:53,360 --> 01:51:56,960
dense scientific literature not to say

2809
01:51:55,610 --> 01:51:58,550
that the scientific literature is

2810
01:51:56,960 --> 01:52:01,550
necessarily a hundred percent correct

2811
01:51:58,550 --> 01:52:04,600
because it never is but certainly to say

2812
01:52:01,550 --> 01:52:07,880
that he was not merely spouting out

2813
01:52:04,600 --> 01:52:10,820
misogynistic and ethnically biased

2814
01:52:07,880 --> 01:52:12,560
opinion quite the contrary so we had a

2815
01:52:10,820 --> 01:52:14,240
nice discussion about that today and

2816
01:52:12,560 --> 01:52:23,780
hopefully the discussion will continue

2817
01:52:14,240 --> 01:52:24,440
so all right questions hello well it's

2818
01:52:23,780 --> 01:52:26,030
great

2819
01:52:24,440 --> 01:52:28,760
I mean look a couple of things about

2820
01:52:26,030 --> 01:52:32,240
that I mean my my daughter has had a

2821
01:52:28,760 --> 01:52:34,220
catastrophic life in many ways a lot of

2822
01:52:32,240 --> 01:52:36,680
things went wrong with her physically

2823
01:52:34,220 --> 01:52:37,400
really bad things and this went

2824
01:52:36,680 --> 01:52:41,140
perfectly

2825
01:52:37,400 --> 01:52:41,140
so like thank God for that

2826
01:52:43,689 --> 01:52:48,969
so then and then the other thing is I

2827
01:52:46,329 --> 01:52:53,709
love kids you know now infants well you

2828
01:52:48,969 --> 01:52:57,070
know it's not that I it's not infants

2829
01:52:53,709 --> 01:52:58,689
are cool and interesting but I'm not

2830
01:52:57,070 --> 01:53:01,179
sure exactly what to do with them you

2831
01:52:58,689 --> 01:53:04,719
know but once they're about six months

2832
01:53:01,179 --> 01:53:06,760
old and then from then on like I love

2833
01:53:04,719 --> 01:53:08,229
having kids around so I'm thrilled about

2834
01:53:06,760 --> 01:53:08,919
the fact that this has happened so

2835
01:53:08,229 --> 01:53:12,610
hooray

2836
01:53:08,919 --> 01:53:15,400
you know hooray so thanks for that

2837
01:53:12,610 --> 01:53:18,159
so more as an aside but what you said

2838
01:53:15,400 --> 01:53:20,050
about not pushing aside the things the

2839
01:53:18,159 --> 01:53:24,010
day kind of made me think of Nikes motto

2840
01:53:20,050 --> 01:53:25,689
just do it yeah I thought cool but um my

2841
01:53:24,010 --> 01:53:27,789
question was that when you were talking

2842
01:53:25,689 --> 01:53:33,119
about circumcision being a contractual

2843
01:53:27,789 --> 01:53:36,070
relationship between sacrifice and

2844
01:53:33,119 --> 01:53:38,050
compared it to a girl having a period

2845
01:53:36,070 --> 01:53:43,360
that didn't make a lot of sense to me

2846
01:53:38,050 --> 01:53:48,030
but also it seems to me that it being a

2847
01:53:43,360 --> 01:53:48,030
sacrifice requires some form of

2848
01:53:48,989 --> 01:53:52,959
willingness basically from the one have

2849
01:53:51,639 --> 01:53:57,340
extreme precision they don't necessarily

2850
01:53:52,959 --> 01:53:58,659
want to put forward what you did you

2851
01:53:57,340 --> 01:54:01,119
said you specifically didn't want to

2852
01:53:58,659 --> 01:54:02,709
address as two infants not having any

2853
01:54:01,119 --> 01:54:06,459
choice in the matter but more in the

2854
01:54:02,709 --> 01:54:08,439
context of it being a sacrifice how does

2855
01:54:06,459 --> 01:54:10,689
that I think I think that's how a modern

2856
01:54:08,439 --> 01:54:12,280
person would see it and I think that

2857
01:54:10,689 --> 01:54:14,979
there's some I think there's some

2858
01:54:12,280 --> 01:54:17,079
utility in that but but it's it's it's

2859
01:54:14,979 --> 01:54:18,669
an incomplete incomplete to some degree

2860
01:54:17,079 --> 01:54:20,559
you know because one of the things that

2861
01:54:18,669 --> 01:54:21,909
happens with God neighbor ham is that

2862
01:54:20,559 --> 01:54:25,030
God tells Abraham that he has to take

2863
01:54:21,909 --> 01:54:26,860
care of his family his children now the

2864
01:54:25,030 --> 01:54:29,429
question is exactly how do you take care

2865
01:54:26,860 --> 01:54:32,340
of your children and the answer is

2866
01:54:29,429 --> 01:54:34,809
sometimes you make decisions for them

2867
01:54:32,340 --> 01:54:36,070
now you might say well be better if they

2868
01:54:34,809 --> 01:54:39,789
could make the decisions for themselves

2869
01:54:36,070 --> 01:54:41,289
and that's actually the case so you

2870
01:54:39,789 --> 01:54:42,550
might say well I won't bring my kids to

2871
01:54:41,289 --> 01:54:44,039
church because it'd be better if they

2872
01:54:42,550 --> 01:54:46,860
could make the decision for themselves

2873
01:54:44,039 --> 01:54:49,119
that's what I did with my kids you know

2874
01:54:46,860 --> 01:54:51,729
but I'm not so sure that was a good idea

2875
01:54:49,119 --> 01:54:53,320
and the reason I'm not so sure it was a

2876
01:54:51,729 --> 01:54:56,889
good idea was because there are a bunch

2877
01:54:53,320 --> 01:54:58,120
of things they didn't learn now the

2878
01:54:56,889 --> 01:55:00,130
degree to which a parent should

2879
01:54:58,120 --> 01:55:04,000
exercise control over his or her child

2880
01:55:00,130 --> 01:55:06,340
is indeterminate but I guess the hope is

2881
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:08,290
that you exercise the minimum amount of

2882
01:55:06,340 --> 01:55:10,330
control necessary to maximize the

2883
01:55:08,290 --> 01:55:12,190
child's probability of success and that

2884
01:55:10,330 --> 01:55:14,740
certainly requires adopting

2885
01:55:12,190 --> 01:55:16,300
responsibility for making decisions as

2886
01:55:14,740 --> 01:55:18,310
well because the child can't make

2887
01:55:16,300 --> 01:55:19,810
decisions you know you can't just let

2888
01:55:18,310 --> 01:55:21,610
the child lay there and make decisions

2889
01:55:19,810 --> 01:55:23,950
right there's that's just not going to

2890
01:55:21,610 --> 01:55:26,710
happen and so you might say well Abraham

2891
01:55:23,950 --> 01:55:30,130
has no right to impose something like

2892
01:55:26,710 --> 01:55:32,170
circumcision on his children and because

2893
01:55:30,130 --> 01:55:33,190
it and the and because it's a sacrifice

2894
01:55:32,170 --> 01:55:35,290
it's something that they should be doing

2895
01:55:33,190 --> 01:55:37,930
themselves but the problem with that is

2896
01:55:35,290 --> 01:55:40,240
that Abraham also has no right to

2897
01:55:37,930 --> 01:55:42,610
abdicate his responsibility to his

2898
01:55:40,240 --> 01:55:46,030
children in the name of some

2899
01:55:42,610 --> 01:55:48,280
hypothetical mercifulness and those two

2900
01:55:46,030 --> 01:55:50,440
things have to be balanced well just

2901
01:55:48,280 --> 01:55:52,420
according to the story Abraham got the

2902
01:55:50,440 --> 01:55:54,640
balance right because of course he's

2903
01:55:52,420 --> 01:55:55,990
made this covenant with God now exactly

2904
01:55:54,640 --> 01:55:58,330
what that means in people's day-to-day

2905
01:55:55,990 --> 01:56:03,820
lives well that's a harder issue but I

2906
01:55:58,330 --> 01:56:07,710
would say I think in the modern world

2907
01:56:03,820 --> 01:56:10,240
people err on the side of I don't know I

2908
01:56:07,710 --> 01:56:11,830
think they're more likely to err on the

2909
01:56:10,240 --> 01:56:13,830
side of taking insufficient

2910
01:56:11,830 --> 01:56:16,690
responsibility for their children

2911
01:56:13,830 --> 01:56:18,790
letting them be free in ways that aren't

2912
01:56:16,690 --> 01:56:20,350
productive that's how it looks to me

2913
01:56:18,790 --> 01:56:25,240
often because they're afraid of their

2914
01:56:20,350 --> 01:56:27,690
children so that's about the best I can

2915
01:56:25,240 --> 01:56:27,690
do without

2916
01:56:30,800 --> 01:56:37,349
dr. Peterson I was recently I've

2917
01:56:35,130 --> 01:56:39,510
recently started reading maps of meaning

2918
01:56:37,349 --> 01:56:41,159
and there was something in the

2919
01:56:39,510 --> 01:56:42,840
introduction to that story that I found

2920
01:56:41,159 --> 01:56:45,149
particularly the introduction that you

2921
01:56:42,840 --> 01:56:49,189
wrote before you went and tell them that

2922
01:56:45,149 --> 01:56:51,570
I found particularly compelling I guess

2923
01:56:49,189 --> 01:56:53,070
the part when you're talking about the

2924
01:56:51,570 --> 01:56:55,679
split that developed in your psyche when

2925
01:56:53,070 --> 01:56:56,820
you were you know yeah all your yeah I

2926
01:56:55,679 --> 01:56:58,199
think he talked about it one of the

2927
01:56:56,820 --> 01:56:59,969
earlier lecture I talked about it a

2928
01:56:58,199 --> 01:57:03,149
little bit today yeah a little bit today

2929
01:56:59,969 --> 01:57:06,659
as well yeah you said something in that

2930
01:57:03,149 --> 01:57:08,760
paragraph there that what you said was

2931
01:57:06,659 --> 01:57:11,849
you have to earn the right to identify

2932
01:57:08,760 --> 01:57:14,579
with an idea yeah certain ideas for sure

2933
01:57:11,849 --> 01:57:16,289
than ideas for sure so basically my

2934
01:57:14,579 --> 01:57:18,719
question is how should a young person

2935
01:57:16,289 --> 01:57:21,959
such as myself who doesn't have a whole

2936
01:57:18,719 --> 01:57:24,269
lot of life experience like be able to

2937
01:57:21,959 --> 01:57:25,829
like read literature and psychology and

2938
01:57:24,269 --> 01:57:27,840
interact with you know the wisdom of

2939
01:57:25,829 --> 01:57:29,610
culture and then incorporate it into a

2940
01:57:27,840 --> 01:57:33,149
structure that still authentically their

2941
01:57:29,610 --> 01:57:34,679
own well look I think the way you ask

2942
01:57:33,149 --> 01:57:38,719
that question means that you're actually

2943
01:57:34,679 --> 01:57:38,719
doing a pretty good job of that well I

2944
01:57:39,769 --> 01:57:44,369
well I mean I mean that because that was

2945
01:57:42,449 --> 01:57:45,809
a very carefully formulated question and

2946
01:57:44,369 --> 01:57:47,820
it was obvious that you were actually

2947
01:57:45,809 --> 01:57:49,469
looking for an answer instead of trying

2948
01:57:47,820 --> 01:57:51,899
to tell the audience a bunch of things

2949
01:57:49,469 --> 01:57:54,059
that you knew which often happens with

2950
01:57:51,899 --> 01:57:56,130
questions right and it's alright often

2951
01:57:54,059 --> 01:57:57,959
it's very annoying for the audience to

2952
01:57:56,130 --> 01:58:01,070
be subject to questions like that right

2953
01:57:57,959 --> 01:58:01,070
because it's a form of

2954
01:58:03,390 --> 01:58:08,350
because it's a form of manipulation it's

2955
01:58:05,950 --> 01:58:11,560
like well I'll cap this off with the

2956
01:58:08,350 --> 01:58:13,719
question but actually it's a speech so

2957
01:58:11,560 --> 01:58:16,420
so I would say you probably already know

2958
01:58:13,719 --> 01:58:17,920
the answer to that and but then I could

2959
01:58:16,420 --> 01:58:19,810
elaborate on that a little bit is like

2960
01:58:17,920 --> 01:58:23,110
there are a lot of books that people

2961
01:58:19,810 --> 01:58:24,489
have historically regarded as great you

2962
01:58:23,110 --> 01:58:27,850
might as well start by assuming that

2963
01:58:24,489 --> 01:58:31,530
they're at least greater than you right

2964
01:58:27,850 --> 01:58:34,810
and then and to approach them with that

2965
01:58:31,530 --> 01:58:37,810
frame of mind because even if there's

2966
01:58:34,810 --> 01:58:40,320
much in them that perhaps is no longer

2967
01:58:37,810 --> 01:58:42,640
relevant often less than people assume

2968
01:58:40,320 --> 01:58:45,610
there's much in them that will be of

2969
01:58:42,640 --> 01:58:48,820
extreme benefit to you and then with

2970
01:58:45,610 --> 01:58:50,580
regards to making them yours the kind of

2971
01:58:48,820 --> 01:58:53,590
wisdom that you get from great books is

2972
01:58:50,580 --> 01:58:55,780
practical wisdom and you act it out and

2973
01:58:53,590 --> 01:58:58,210
so then what you do is you try to

2974
01:58:55,780 --> 01:59:00,580
incorporate what you learn into your

2975
01:58:58,210 --> 01:59:02,050
life into your practices and then if you

2976
01:59:00,580 --> 01:59:04,480
incorporate it into your life and your

2977
01:59:02,050 --> 01:59:07,030
practices you build a bridge between you

2978
01:59:04,480 --> 01:59:09,010
and the great idea right because you

2979
01:59:07,030 --> 01:59:10,600
figured out how to manifest itself in

2980
01:59:09,010 --> 01:59:12,719
the conditions of your own life that's

2981
01:59:10,600 --> 01:59:15,790
something like making the archetypal

2982
01:59:12,719 --> 01:59:17,800
personal which is which is the right

2983
01:59:15,790 --> 01:59:19,780
thing to do right it's the proper thing

2984
01:59:17,800 --> 01:59:22,600
to do because that expands your life

2985
01:59:19,780 --> 01:59:26,200
upward and outward and in Nobel's you

2986
01:59:22,600 --> 01:59:27,610
and brings you up as well but so

2987
01:59:26,200 --> 01:59:30,130
humility is part of it it's like

2988
01:59:27,610 --> 01:59:34,090
approach these books as if they have

2989
01:59:30,130 --> 01:59:35,710
something to teach you and then it's

2990
01:59:34,090 --> 01:59:39,400
humility again in the second places

2991
01:59:35,710 --> 01:59:42,820
don't take the ideas to yourself until

2992
01:59:39,400 --> 01:59:44,380
you live them there'll be lots of time

2993
01:59:42,820 --> 01:59:45,940
for that and besides you know even as a

2994
01:59:44,380 --> 01:59:48,910
young person it's not like you have

2995
01:59:45,940 --> 01:59:51,040
nothing to say but the only things that

2996
01:59:48,910 --> 01:59:53,440
you have to say are your things to say

2997
01:59:51,040 --> 01:59:54,760
and it's not necessarily that easy to

2998
01:59:53,440 --> 01:59:56,140
figure out what they are but as I said

2999
01:59:54,760 --> 01:59:58,270
you did a fine job of that when you

3000
01:59:56,140 --> 02:00:00,820
asked the question so I think I think as

3001
01:59:58,270 --> 02:00:04,270
far as I can tell you already know what

3002
02:00:00,820 --> 02:00:07,920
to do so good do it read everything

3003
02:00:04,270 --> 02:00:07,920
great you can get your damn hands on

3004
02:00:12,240 --> 02:00:20,740
hello dr. Peterson so a lot of your work

3005
02:00:17,260 --> 02:00:23,070
a lot of your lectures recommend the

3006
02:00:20,740 --> 02:00:28,290
audience tackle life with a lot of

3007
02:00:23,070 --> 02:00:31,270
attention and intention and you know in

3008
02:00:28,290 --> 02:00:32,860
my kind of personal gateway drug to

3009
02:00:31,270 --> 02:00:36,730
philosophy has been more Eastern

3010
02:00:32,860 --> 02:00:41,410
philosophy and like the bug hood gita

3011
02:00:36,730 --> 02:00:46,210
and the work of Alan Watts and tower's

3012
02:00:41,410 --> 02:00:47,980
Calvinism and what I've noticed I may be

3013
02:00:46,210 --> 02:00:51,030
wrong but this is a common theme in

3014
02:00:47,980 --> 02:00:58,290
Eastern philosophy which is more passive

3015
02:00:51,030 --> 02:01:01,960
non action don't make as many plans I

3016
02:00:58,290 --> 02:01:03,700
wonder how you reconcile that in how you

3017
02:01:01,960 --> 02:01:05,650
are reconciling that because you

3018
02:01:03,700 --> 02:01:09,220
mentioned earlier in previous lectures

3019
02:01:05,650 --> 02:01:13,020
that you've read the TEL teaching how do

3020
02:01:09,220 --> 02:01:13,020
you reconcile those two different views

3021
02:01:13,830 --> 02:01:19,630
well I think first that the daodejing in

3022
02:01:18,010 --> 02:01:23,500
particular isn't about inaction it's

3023
02:01:19,630 --> 02:01:27,220
about minimal proper action and it's

3024
02:01:23,500 --> 02:01:30,340
also about minimal proper action after a

3025
02:01:27,220 --> 02:01:32,830
tremendous amount of sacrifice right so

3026
02:01:30,340 --> 02:01:36,250
the sage that's speaking forth in the

3027
02:01:32,830 --> 02:01:38,140
Dao de Jing has already let go of almost

3028
02:01:36,250 --> 02:01:41,080
everything that he needs to let go of

3029
02:01:38,140 --> 02:01:43,320
and a tremendous amount of what you're

3030
02:01:41,080 --> 02:01:45,700
reading in the Eastern philosophies is

3031
02:01:43,320 --> 02:01:48,280
predicated I think at least in part on

3032
02:01:45,700 --> 02:01:49,810
the idea of sacrifice there's lots of

3033
02:01:48,280 --> 02:01:52,570
things that you're grabbing on to like

3034
02:01:49,810 --> 02:01:55,390
the monkey you know with the jar that's

3035
02:01:52,570 --> 02:01:57,640
actually causing your misery and so

3036
02:01:55,390 --> 02:01:59,680
sometimes letting go is the right way of

3037
02:01:57,640 --> 02:02:03,400
moving ahead but to me that ties into

3038
02:01:59,680 --> 02:02:05,770
this idea of sacrifice so now whether

3039
02:02:03,400 --> 02:02:07,600
there's more than that whether there's

3040
02:02:05,770 --> 02:02:09,280
more intentionality in Western

3041
02:02:07,600 --> 02:02:11,850
philosophy and less intentionality in

3042
02:02:09,280 --> 02:02:14,530
Eastern philosophy I'm not exactly sure

3043
02:02:11,850 --> 02:02:17,500
one way of mediating between those two

3044
02:02:14,530 --> 02:02:20,659
was was formulated at least in part by

3045
02:02:17,500 --> 02:02:22,999
Carl Jung he pointed out that

3046
02:02:20,659 --> 02:02:26,629
the archetypal figure for what the last

3047
02:02:22,999 --> 02:02:31,639
died at 32 and so to some degree that

3048
02:02:26,629 --> 02:02:36,079
outgoing extroverted let's say nature of

3049
02:02:31,639 --> 02:02:38,329
the West is a consequence of its

3050
02:02:36,079 --> 02:02:44,059
youthfulness in some sense it's useful

3051
02:02:38,329 --> 02:02:47,119
ethos and that the East Buddha died at a

3052
02:02:44,059 --> 02:02:49,449
fairly ripe old age and even in the

3053
02:02:47,119 --> 02:02:51,889
Hindu practices if I remember correctly

3054
02:02:49,449 --> 02:02:54,739
for many Hindu temples there's a lot of

3055
02:02:51,889 --> 02:02:57,050
erotic sculptures an idea is something

3056
02:02:54,739 --> 02:02:58,820
like it can't get past the damn erotic

3057
02:02:57,050 --> 02:03:01,070
sculptures it's not time to go into the

3058
02:02:58,820 --> 02:03:03,050
temple but it's more than that it might

3059
02:03:01,070 --> 02:03:05,439
also be that if you're young it's not

3060
02:03:03,050 --> 02:03:08,719
time to get past the erotic sculptures

3061
02:03:05,439 --> 02:03:12,079
so maybe maybe there's a moving forward

3062
02:03:08,719 --> 02:03:15,429
into life in youth and a letting go in

3063
02:03:12,079 --> 02:03:18,709
in the latter part of life and that's

3064
02:03:15,429 --> 02:03:20,989
well that was Jung's way of mediating

3065
02:03:18,709 --> 02:03:23,449
between those two traditions I think

3066
02:03:20,989 --> 02:03:25,449
they're tightly aligned with regards to

3067
02:03:23,449 --> 02:03:27,829
the importance of sacrifice it

3068
02:03:25,449 --> 02:03:31,159
frequently is the case that it's your

3069
02:03:27,829 --> 02:03:33,949
desire Maya let's say your desire that's

3070
02:03:31,159 --> 02:03:37,159
causing your suffering right and so

3071
02:03:33,949 --> 02:03:38,780
there's an emphasis in Buddhism even

3072
02:03:37,159 --> 02:03:42,349
more than in Taoism I would say on

3073
02:03:38,780 --> 02:03:45,739
letting go letting go of what's making

3074
02:03:42,349 --> 02:03:48,439
you miserable and but do you remember

3075
02:03:45,739 --> 02:03:50,359
the thing about Buddha is that he got

3076
02:03:48,439 --> 02:03:54,169
enlightened under the bow tree right

3077
02:03:50,359 --> 02:03:57,649
he basically stepped into the City of

3078
02:03:54,169 --> 02:04:01,099
God he stepped into nirvana and he could

3079
02:03:57,649 --> 02:04:02,780
have stayed there but he chose to come

3080
02:04:01,099 --> 02:04:06,829
back because he decided that he had a

3081
02:04:02,780 --> 02:04:09,249
responsibility to rectify suffering in

3082
02:04:06,829 --> 02:04:12,019
the rest of the world that it was not

3083
02:04:09,249 --> 02:04:16,010
sufficient for him to be enlightened

3084
02:04:12,019 --> 02:04:18,859
well everything else was left in a state

3085
02:04:16,010 --> 02:04:22,179
of insufficiency and suffering and so I

3086
02:04:18,859 --> 02:04:27,829
wouldn't call that inaction you know

3087
02:04:22,179 --> 02:04:30,709
it's a I've made the mistake myself it's

3088
02:04:27,829 --> 02:04:33,169
in action versus non action I actually

3089
02:04:30,709 --> 02:04:34,370
had to look up that's that good that's

3090
02:04:33,169 --> 02:04:36,530
well not

3091
02:04:34,370 --> 02:04:38,420
- really the daodejing does a very good

3092
02:04:36,530 --> 02:04:41,780
job of distinguishing between those two

3093
02:04:38,420 --> 02:04:43,580
because non-action is the minimum

3094
02:04:41,780 --> 02:04:48,200
necessary action to keep the balance

3095
02:04:43,580 --> 02:04:50,480
between order and chaos proper right at

3096
02:04:48,200 --> 02:04:54,020
the end in the egg and the Dao de Jing

3097
02:04:50,480 --> 02:04:58,700
is very very emphatic about this you

3098
02:04:54,020 --> 02:05:00,650
detach and you watch and when it's time

3099
02:04:58,700 --> 02:05:04,090
to intervene you intervene minimally

3100
02:05:00,650 --> 02:05:08,660
without a lot of arrogant self

3101
02:05:04,090 --> 02:05:10,610
propagandize ation and you tap and if

3102
02:05:08,660 --> 02:05:12,380
you do that properly you hardly have to

3103
02:05:10,610 --> 02:05:16,280
do it at all and it's as if you're doing

3104
02:05:12,380 --> 02:05:18,440
nothing and there's this great wisdom in

3105
02:05:16,280 --> 02:05:22,100
that book I really like the Dow teaching

3106
02:05:18,440 --> 02:05:24,800
it's it's a remarkable document and I've

3107
02:05:22,100 --> 02:05:26,630
seen managers who were like that who are

3108
02:05:24,800 --> 02:05:29,900
really good at running their company who

3109
02:05:26,630 --> 02:05:32,510
did nothing Lauren but and what they did

3110
02:05:29,900 --> 02:05:34,670
well but that but first of all they set

3111
02:05:32,510 --> 02:05:36,350
up people to replace them because

3112
02:05:34,670 --> 02:05:37,760
they're Dirk idea was well if I'm a

3113
02:05:36,350 --> 02:05:39,620
really good manager then this place

3114
02:05:37,760 --> 02:05:41,870
could run without me there's a real

3115
02:05:39,620 --> 02:05:44,450
humility in that let me just kind of

3116
02:05:41,870 --> 02:05:46,160
wandered around the place talking to

3117
02:05:44,450 --> 02:05:48,110
people and if there was a bit of a

3118
02:05:46,160 --> 02:05:52,280
problem then they just you know turned

3119
02:05:48,110 --> 02:05:54,080
the knob the tenth of a degree and the

3120
02:05:52,280 --> 02:05:55,670
place ran smoothly and it was as if they

3121
02:05:54,080 --> 02:05:58,460
were doing nothing and what they were

3122
02:05:55,670 --> 02:06:01,400
doing was detaching so they weren't

3123
02:05:58,460 --> 02:06:03,830
being buried by their current concerns

3124
02:06:01,400 --> 02:06:06,550
they were watching to see what was going

3125
02:06:03,830 --> 02:06:10,100
on and then they were minimally

3126
02:06:06,550 --> 02:06:15,110
interacting and that worked like a charm

3127
02:06:10,100 --> 02:06:16,850
so I think that the I don't like the

3128
02:06:15,110 --> 02:06:18,260
idea that all religious traditions are

3129
02:06:16,850 --> 02:06:20,720
the same because that just makes them

3130
02:06:18,260 --> 02:06:23,840
into like a gray mass but I don't see

3131
02:06:20,720 --> 02:06:26,570
that there's any difference there that

3132
02:06:23,840 --> 02:06:28,190
can't be bridged I think as you look

3133
02:06:26,570 --> 02:06:30,670
into the details the bridge has become

3134
02:06:28,190 --> 02:06:30,670
more clear

3135
02:06:31,210 --> 02:06:41,110
[Applause]

3136
02:06:38,880 --> 02:06:42,790
I'll get you to speak into the

3137
02:06:41,110 --> 02:06:46,600
microphone especially when you're saying

3138
02:06:42,790 --> 02:06:54,040
self-deprecating things let everybody

3139
02:06:46,600 --> 02:06:56,320
hear you okay I much my pleasure what's

3140
02:06:54,040 --> 02:07:00,670
happened what's happened to you as a

3141
02:06:56,320 --> 02:07:03,340
consequence yeah yeah well our view

3142
02:07:00,670 --> 02:07:06,040
seeing it that way anyways well mainly

3143
02:07:03,340 --> 02:07:07,810
on I've had I've had whatever you say

3144
02:07:06,040 --> 02:07:10,660
right it's something I thought but not

3145
02:07:07,810 --> 02:07:12,340
had been able to articulate right so

3146
02:07:10,660 --> 02:07:15,040
it's been very helpful in that regards

3147
02:07:12,340 --> 02:07:18,880
and kind of saving a lot of time no yep

3148
02:07:15,040 --> 02:07:20,410
good good good good my main question is

3149
02:07:18,880 --> 02:07:22,090
actually on something you said a couple

3150
02:07:20,410 --> 02:07:29,380
lectures ago it was something along the

3151
02:07:22,090 --> 02:07:31,630
lines of a family um so I think I'm like

3152
02:07:29,380 --> 02:07:33,670
god that's the history of your family

3153
02:07:31,630 --> 02:07:35,800
kind of like the sims or your family

3154
02:07:33,670 --> 02:07:38,400
something like that yeah be awed you're

3155
02:07:35,800 --> 02:07:44,199
facing it all the time yeah what's uh

3156
02:07:38,400 --> 02:07:45,969
how can you stand on that one well

3157
02:07:44,199 --> 02:07:49,840
there's this idea in the Old Testament

3158
02:07:45,969 --> 02:07:52,870
that your sins might be visited unto

3159
02:07:49,840 --> 02:07:56,530
your family seven generations down seems

3160
02:07:52,870 --> 02:07:58,000
kind of harsh but you know when you're

3161
02:07:56,530 --> 02:08:01,210
confronting maybe your father's

3162
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:02,830
tyrannical yeah but you know maybe his

3163
02:08:01,210 --> 02:08:05,290
father beat the hell out of him and

3164
02:08:02,830 --> 02:08:07,870
maybe his father's father was a vicious

3165
02:08:05,290 --> 02:08:11,080
alcoholic and he just bloody well don't

3166
02:08:07,870 --> 02:08:12,910
know how far back that goes and and that

3167
02:08:11,080 --> 02:08:15,400
means also you don't exactly know what

3168
02:08:12,910 --> 02:08:17,020
you're dealing with right to some degree

3169
02:08:15,400 --> 02:08:18,670
you're dealing with your father but only

3170
02:08:17,020 --> 02:08:21,219
partly what you're dealing with is the

3171
02:08:18,670 --> 02:08:23,290
pathological paternal spirit something

3172
02:08:21,219 --> 02:08:24,489
like that and it's better to think about

3173
02:08:23,290 --> 02:08:26,890
that way because it becomes an

3174
02:08:24,489 --> 02:08:29,230
existential issue at that point you know

3175
02:08:26,890 --> 02:08:31,480
so you could say that while the father

3176
02:08:29,230 --> 02:08:33,070
has two components and I mean this

3177
02:08:31,480 --> 02:08:34,780
psychologically speaking there's the

3178
02:08:33,070 --> 02:08:37,449
Great Father that's beneficial and

3179
02:08:34,780 --> 02:08:39,250
protective and that that organizes

3180
02:08:37,449 --> 02:08:40,840
society and teaches you how to speak and

3181
02:08:39,250 --> 02:08:42,340
has produced all these wonderful things

3182
02:08:40,840 --> 02:08:45,640
and then there's the tyrannical

3183
02:08:42,340 --> 02:08:47,380
oppressive part of the father just like

3184
02:08:45,640 --> 02:08:48,619
there's the terrible part of mother

3185
02:08:47,380 --> 02:08:49,940
nature that's destroy

3186
02:08:48,619 --> 02:08:51,889
than the benevolent part of mother

3187
02:08:49,940 --> 02:08:54,860
nature that's wonderful and productive

3188
02:08:51,889 --> 02:08:56,869
and you're stuck with that right you're

3189
02:08:54,860 --> 02:08:58,969
stuck with having to mediate between

3190
02:08:56,869 --> 02:09:00,830
those opposing forces just like you're

3191
02:08:58,969 --> 02:09:02,420
stuck with the adversarial part of

3192
02:09:00,830 --> 02:09:04,429
yourself and the heroic part of yourself

3193
02:09:02,420 --> 02:09:07,250
and it's up to you to set those things

3194
02:09:04,429 --> 02:09:10,460
right otherwise they propagate into the

3195
02:09:07,250 --> 02:09:11,830
future and it isn't it straightforward

3196
02:09:10,460 --> 02:09:15,849
thing to say how to set them right

3197
02:09:11,830 --> 02:09:20,270
there's quite a good movie about that oh

3198
02:09:15,849 --> 02:09:22,190
now I will Magnolia which I really love

3199
02:09:20,270 --> 02:09:24,020
it's by Paul Anderson if I remember

3200
02:09:22,190 --> 02:09:26,989
correctly I hope that's right it's a

3201
02:09:24,020 --> 02:09:28,820
beautiful movie and it's about this part

3202
02:09:26,989 --> 02:09:30,710
of it's about this kid whose father's

3203
02:09:28,820 --> 02:09:33,440
really pushing him to be a superstar at

3204
02:09:30,710 --> 02:09:38,300
a at a crucial right he's a genius kid

3205
02:09:33,440 --> 02:09:39,920
and the kid studies this guy named

3206
02:09:38,300 --> 02:09:41,540
Charles fort you don't understand this

3207
02:09:39,920 --> 02:09:42,679
movie if you don't know this because you

3208
02:09:41,540 --> 02:09:44,570
got to know about Charles fort to

3209
02:09:42,679 --> 02:09:47,480
understand Magnolia Charles fort was

3210
02:09:44,570 --> 02:09:49,190
this weird old guy who got rich with an

3211
02:09:47,480 --> 02:09:50,690
inheritance when he was like 20 and

3212
02:09:49,190 --> 02:09:52,820
spent the rest of his life in libraries

3213
02:09:50,690 --> 02:09:55,520
looking up impossible things and

3214
02:09:52,820 --> 02:09:56,960
documenting them impossible things that

3215
02:09:55,520 --> 02:09:58,969
couldn't happen from a scientific

3216
02:09:56,960 --> 02:10:01,250
perspective that were well attested to

3217
02:09:58,969 --> 02:10:03,409
by multiple observers and he produced

3218
02:10:01,250 --> 02:10:06,460
this news paper called the 14 times

3219
02:10:03,409 --> 02:10:09,409
which still runs anyways in magnolia

3220
02:10:06,460 --> 02:10:11,719
magnolia begins with this guy who falls

3221
02:10:09,409 --> 02:10:13,400
out of a building and then is shot by a

3222
02:10:11,719 --> 02:10:15,280
woman who misses her husband with a

3223
02:10:13,400 --> 02:10:18,230
rifle as he falls and I think she's

3224
02:10:15,280 --> 02:10:19,760
she's charged with murder and the street

3225
02:10:18,230 --> 02:10:21,530
names have something to do with the

3226
02:10:19,760 --> 02:10:24,020
deaths and his fall and all of that

3227
02:10:21,530 --> 02:10:27,110
happened and then in the movie there's a

3228
02:10:24,020 --> 02:10:28,489
rain of frogs and there are rains of

3229
02:10:27,110 --> 02:10:30,020
frogs from time to time sometimes

3230
02:10:28,489 --> 02:10:31,699
they're frozen sometimes they're rains

3231
02:10:30,020 --> 02:10:33,290
of fish sometimes they're frozen it's

3232
02:10:31,699 --> 02:10:35,420
like what the hell how does that happen

3233
02:10:33,290 --> 02:10:38,239
happens quite frequently as it turns out

3234
02:10:35,420 --> 02:10:41,869
there's a rain of frogs in the in the

3235
02:10:38,239 --> 02:10:43,190
movie magnolia and this little kid see

3236
02:10:41,869 --> 02:10:46,760
what happened to him is that he's on

3237
02:10:43,190 --> 02:10:49,690
stage and he ends up peeing his pants

3238
02:10:46,760 --> 02:10:52,250
because of the pressure basically and

3239
02:10:49,690 --> 02:10:54,889
humiliates himself and then there's this

3240
02:10:52,250 --> 02:10:57,199
rain of frogs which he kind of takes as

3241
02:10:54,889 --> 02:10:58,880
a sign from God and then he goes to his

3242
02:10:57,199 --> 02:11:02,039
father even he's like eight years old

3243
02:10:58,880 --> 02:11:04,619
this kid and he says you have to stop

3244
02:11:02,039 --> 02:11:07,409
to be and he's dead serious about very

3245
02:11:04,619 --> 02:11:09,119
careful not being you know what would

3246
02:11:07,409 --> 02:11:11,400
you call insubordinate nothing like that

3247
02:11:09,119 --> 02:11:14,670
he decides that that's coming to an end

3248
02:11:11,400 --> 02:11:16,079
right now and you have to make those

3249
02:11:14,670 --> 02:11:17,610
decisions in your family because

3250
02:11:16,079 --> 02:11:19,650
otherwise things propagate down the

3251
02:11:17,610 --> 02:11:21,599
generations right and every family is

3252
02:11:19,650 --> 02:11:25,139
rife with pathologies of one form or

3253
02:11:21,599 --> 02:11:27,929
another and you can learn from that and

3254
02:11:25,139 --> 02:11:29,340
refuse to push it forward and that's

3255
02:11:27,929 --> 02:11:34,079
part of I think what you do when you

3256
02:11:29,340 --> 02:11:36,449
when you when you shoulder your

3257
02:11:34,079 --> 02:11:38,099
existential burden because everyone is

3258
02:11:36,449 --> 02:11:40,559
the beneficiary and the victim of the

3259
02:11:38,099 --> 02:11:42,119
tyrannical father just like everyone is

3260
02:11:40,559 --> 02:11:45,659
the beneficiary and the victim of mother

3261
02:11:42,119 --> 02:11:47,099
nature and of themselves and so you lock

3262
02:11:45,659 --> 02:11:49,409
horns with that and straighten it out

3263
02:11:47,099 --> 02:11:52,230
one way or another and you don't move it

3264
02:11:49,409 --> 02:11:54,750
forward to the next generation so and

3265
02:11:52,230 --> 02:11:59,449
maybe you detach it a bit from your

3266
02:11:54,750 --> 02:12:02,250
parents too because god only knows what

3267
02:11:59,449 --> 02:12:04,309
combination of catastrophes culminated

3268
02:12:02,250 --> 02:12:11,239
in their particular forms of pathology

3269
02:12:04,309 --> 02:12:11,239
so good enough

3270
02:12:17,230 --> 02:12:22,820
so this week we've had the Google thing

3271
02:12:20,659 --> 02:12:24,639
there was the YouTube thing that

3272
02:12:22,820 --> 02:12:26,840
happened last week

3273
02:12:24,639 --> 02:12:29,750
what's going on with censorship and what

3274
02:12:26,840 --> 02:12:31,580
should people do about it if you're in a

3275
02:12:29,750 --> 02:12:33,619
workplace and pathological things are

3276
02:12:31,580 --> 02:12:35,239
happening this is easy I can tell you

3277
02:12:33,619 --> 02:12:37,760
how you know if pathological things are

3278
02:12:35,239 --> 02:12:39,830
happening at your workplace or they're

3279
02:12:37,760 --> 02:12:43,909
happening with you one of the two but

3280
02:12:39,830 --> 02:12:46,460
you can straighten that out if you're

3281
02:12:43,909 --> 02:12:49,090
being required to do things that make

3282
02:12:46,460 --> 02:12:54,560
you weak and ashamed

3283
02:12:49,090 --> 02:12:57,790
then stop don't do them like one of the

3284
02:12:54,560 --> 02:13:03,290
things I learned from Solzhenitsyn and

3285
02:12:57,790 --> 02:13:05,750
Frankel was that systems go terribly

3286
02:13:03,290 --> 02:13:07,940
under out of control when people don't

3287
02:13:05,750 --> 02:13:10,520
stop them when they're going mildly out

3288
02:13:07,940 --> 02:13:12,710
of control you know when you might say I

3289
02:13:10,520 --> 02:13:14,420
should just keep my goddamn head down

3290
02:13:12,710 --> 02:13:17,540
and shut up it's like maybe you should

3291
02:13:14,420 --> 02:13:19,040
like that's not bad advice you know you

3292
02:13:17,540 --> 02:13:20,840
don't want to make unnecessary enemies

3293
02:13:19,040 --> 02:13:23,030
and you don't need any more trouble than

3294
02:13:20,840 --> 02:13:24,980
you need but you got to ask yourself on

3295
02:13:23,030 --> 02:13:28,070
a day-to-day basis what makes you think

3296
02:13:24,980 --> 02:13:31,130
you're not selling your soul you know

3297
02:13:28,070 --> 02:13:33,920
and there's so much foolishness going on

3298
02:13:31,130 --> 02:13:35,420
in the mid-level bureaucratic world now

3299
02:13:33,920 --> 02:13:38,480
that's where all the tyranny seems to be

3300
02:13:35,420 --> 02:13:40,460
focused and the reason that it

3301
02:13:38,480 --> 02:13:43,639
multiplies is because sensible people

3302
02:13:40,460 --> 02:13:45,770
say nothing when they should say

3303
02:13:43,639 --> 02:13:48,170
something and what's so strange about

3304
02:13:45,770 --> 02:13:50,480
that is that there are way more sensible

3305
02:13:48,170 --> 02:13:53,150
people than people who aren't sensible

3306
02:13:50,480 --> 02:13:55,159
they're just not as noisy so whether

3307
02:13:53,150 --> 02:13:56,600
you'll turn out if like you know so

3308
02:13:55,159 --> 02:13:58,670
let's say something's bugging the hell

3309
02:13:56,600 --> 02:14:00,739
out of you at work well then you have to

3310
02:13:58,670 --> 02:14:02,989
prepare to find another job that's the

3311
02:14:00,739 --> 02:14:05,719
first thing you have to do I don't think

3312
02:14:02,989 --> 02:14:07,580
that you should find another job but you

3313
02:14:05,719 --> 02:14:09,949
should prepare to find another job and

3314
02:14:07,580 --> 02:14:12,440
if possible you should prepare to find a

3315
02:14:09,949 --> 02:14:13,969
better job because if you can't tell

3316
02:14:12,440 --> 02:14:16,219
someone to go to hell then you can't

3317
02:14:13,969 --> 02:14:17,840
negotiate with them and if and if

3318
02:14:16,219 --> 02:14:19,460
they've got you over a barrel then you

3319
02:14:17,840 --> 02:14:21,230
can't say anything so you going to

3320
02:14:19,460 --> 02:14:22,820
you've got to set yourself up so you've

3321
02:14:21,230 --> 02:14:24,020
got some ability and actually that's a

3322
02:14:22,820 --> 02:14:24,679
really good principle in your life

3323
02:14:24,020 --> 02:14:26,900
period

3324
02:14:24,679 --> 02:14:29,960
you should set yourself up so that you

3325
02:14:26,900 --> 02:14:31,250
have a lateral move at hand and

3326
02:14:29,960 --> 02:14:33,200
you should find out well are there

3327
02:14:31,250 --> 02:14:35,750
things at work that are disturbing my

3328
02:14:33,200 --> 02:14:37,520
soul you know when you find that out

3329
02:14:35,750 --> 02:14:39,620
first of all you ask yourself okay I'm

3330
02:14:37,520 --> 02:14:42,469
disturbed at work okay I'm probably weak

3331
02:14:39,620 --> 02:14:44,060
and deceitful and useless and lazy you

3332
02:14:42,469 --> 02:14:46,370
might as well start with that and then

3333
02:14:44,060 --> 02:14:48,380
you talk to some people like your your

3334
02:14:46,370 --> 02:14:50,870
wife your friends your coworkers and

3335
02:14:48,380 --> 02:14:53,090
find out are you stupid deceitful and

3336
02:14:50,870 --> 02:14:55,130
lazy or is there something not-so-good

3337
02:14:53,090 --> 02:14:57,020
going on at work and so if you if you

3338
02:14:55,130 --> 02:14:58,550
can then eliminate your own personal

3339
02:14:57,020 --> 02:15:00,680
pathology as a cause of your

3340
02:14:58,550 --> 02:15:02,660
dissatisfaction then maybe there's

3341
02:15:00,680 --> 02:15:05,000
something rotten in the state of Denmark

3342
02:15:02,660 --> 02:15:06,430
and maybe you should say something about

3343
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:09,530
it before the whole goddamn thing

3344
02:15:06,430 --> 02:15:11,090
collapses because that can happen it can

3345
02:15:09,530 --> 02:15:13,310
happen in companies a lot faster than

3346
02:15:11,090 --> 02:15:15,140
people ever think you know and you may

3347
02:15:13,310 --> 02:15:16,670
find that well first of all you may find

3348
02:15:15,140 --> 02:15:18,170
if you say something well first of all

3349
02:15:16,670 --> 02:15:19,969
that's an adventure that's for sure

3350
02:15:18,170 --> 02:15:22,310
that's a bloody adventure and you have

3351
02:15:19,969 --> 02:15:23,900
to do it carefully and you have to be

3352
02:15:22,310 --> 02:15:25,969
prepared for it it might be the best

3353
02:15:23,900 --> 02:15:27,500
thing that ever happened to you and the

3354
02:15:25,969 --> 02:15:29,630
other thing is if you're careful about

3355
02:15:27,500 --> 02:15:32,180
it you get your words right like in this

3356
02:15:29,630 --> 02:15:33,800
is a this is strategic battle right it's

3357
02:15:32,180 --> 02:15:35,989
not something you wander into carelessly

3358
02:15:33,800 --> 02:15:37,730
then you may find that there's lots of

3359
02:15:35,989 --> 02:15:39,290
people who feel exactly the same way you

3360
02:15:37,730 --> 02:15:40,880
do and that you've actually caught and

3361
02:15:39,290 --> 02:15:42,920
gone to something you're a canary in a

3362
02:15:40,880 --> 02:15:47,120
coal mine and not just some like

3363
02:15:42,920 --> 02:15:48,770
psychopathic mouthpiece so you go to ask

3364
02:15:47,120 --> 02:15:50,570
yourself when you go and do what you do

3365
02:15:48,770 --> 02:15:52,460
like is this making you stronger is this

3366
02:15:50,570 --> 02:15:54,890
making you weaker and if it's making you

3367
02:15:52,460 --> 02:15:57,050
weaker then you got to ask yourself do

3368
02:15:54,890 --> 02:15:58,580
you really want to be weaker because the

3369
02:15:57,050 --> 02:16:00,770
weaker you get the more your tyrannize

3370
02:15:58,580 --> 02:16:03,020
and then worse than that like the weaker

3371
02:16:00,770 --> 02:16:04,730
you get the more bitter you get and the

3372
02:16:03,020 --> 02:16:06,380
more you'll work towards terrible things

3373
02:16:04,730 --> 02:16:08,390
the more you'll snap at your wife the

3374
02:16:06,380 --> 02:16:10,550
more you'll kick your kids you know like

3375
02:16:08,390 --> 02:16:13,040
it's no joke to be terrorized at work

3376
02:16:10,550 --> 02:16:16,750
and so I would say you have an ethical

3377
02:16:13,040 --> 02:16:20,090
responsibility as a citizen to

3378
02:16:16,750 --> 02:16:23,270
forthrightly confront creeping tyranny

3379
02:16:20,090 --> 02:16:25,820
no matter where it occurs and part of

3380
02:16:23,270 --> 02:16:27,469
part of what we're learning I would say

3381
02:16:25,820 --> 02:16:30,530
from these stories if we're learning

3382
02:16:27,469 --> 02:16:33,139
anything at all is that if you're aimed

3383
02:16:30,530 --> 02:16:34,729
at the good which is a question you

3384
02:16:33,139 --> 02:16:36,950
really got to ask yourself you know if

3385
02:16:34,729 --> 02:16:39,590
you're genuinely end up too good then

3386
02:16:36,950 --> 02:16:42,639
take heart because you're a lot stronger

3387
02:16:39,590 --> 02:16:42,639
than you think so

3388
02:16:42,960 --> 02:16:48,000
I have a follow-up question okay so I'm

3389
02:16:46,710 --> 02:16:50,400
speaking to there's lots of people who

3390
02:16:48,000 --> 02:16:52,080
are in this situation like you know

3391
02:16:50,400 --> 02:16:54,420
people at universities and corporations

3392
02:16:52,080 --> 02:16:57,120
all over the place I you know Google is

3393
02:16:54,420 --> 02:17:00,080
not the only company that is no

3394
02:16:57,120 --> 02:17:03,330
unfindable what's the worst repressive

3395
02:17:00,080 --> 02:17:07,710
freedom of speech denying workplace

3396
02:17:03,330 --> 02:17:09,870
codes and everybody feels alone right

3397
02:17:07,710 --> 02:17:12,210
they're all like why should I stand up

3398
02:17:09,870 --> 02:17:15,179
be a martyr get fired

3399
02:17:12,210 --> 02:17:19,740
this guy Google got fired yeah what's

3400
02:17:15,179 --> 02:17:22,190
the point like I'm asking rhetorical no

3401
02:17:19,740 --> 02:17:24,389
no it's a good question and how do you

3402
02:17:22,190 --> 02:17:27,450
how do you convince people that there's

3403
02:17:24,389 --> 02:17:31,050
a point to standing up when it appears

3404
02:17:27,450 --> 02:17:32,490
to be futile well the first thing I

3405
02:17:31,050 --> 02:17:37,229
think is you convince them that it's not

3406
02:17:32,490 --> 02:17:40,080
futile it might be difficult but it's

3407
02:17:37,229 --> 02:17:42,090
not futile if you get your words right

3408
02:17:40,080 --> 02:17:44,580
you have something to say

3409
02:17:42,090 --> 02:17:46,050
there'll be an impact of those words it

3410
02:17:44,580 --> 02:17:47,969
might not be the impact that you would

3411
02:17:46,050 --> 02:17:52,260
choose but but the other thing you got

3412
02:17:47,969 --> 02:17:54,780
to tell people is pick your poison you

3413
02:17:52,260 --> 02:17:57,389
don't you may be in a situation where

3414
02:17:54,780 --> 02:17:58,830
you don't have you don't have a cake

3415
02:17:57,389 --> 02:18:01,650
walk to the garden of paradise

3416
02:17:58,830 --> 02:18:03,690
you got tyranny or famine those are your

3417
02:18:01,650 --> 02:18:07,139
choices but you get to pick which one

3418
02:18:03,690 --> 02:18:09,809
you have and I would say if if you're

3419
02:18:07,139 --> 02:18:12,840
being oppressed and I mean in your soul

3420
02:18:09,809 --> 02:18:15,479
by what you're required to swallow at

3421
02:18:12,840 --> 02:18:18,150
work well you think you're not paying a

3422
02:18:15,479 --> 02:18:21,900
price for that you have no self-respect

3423
02:18:18,150 --> 02:18:24,630
and and rightly so but worse than that

3424
02:18:21,900 --> 02:18:27,059
you're an agent of your own destruction

3425
02:18:24,630 --> 02:18:29,219
you're destroying your own ideal and

3426
02:18:27,059 --> 02:18:34,590
you're letting people who are weak and

3427
02:18:29,219 --> 02:18:36,510
corrupt win and if you stood up and and

3428
02:18:34,590 --> 02:18:38,219
stood up property but you have to put

3429
02:18:36,510 --> 02:18:39,510
yourself in order to do this at least to

3430
02:18:38,219 --> 02:18:42,030
some degree right you can't do it

3431
02:18:39,510 --> 02:18:44,570
casually you have to do it from some

3432
02:18:42,030 --> 02:18:47,250
position of preparedness and strength

3433
02:18:44,570 --> 02:18:49,460
then what makes you think you couldn't

3434
02:18:47,250 --> 02:18:53,099
scare them back into the corners and

3435
02:18:49,460 --> 02:18:55,860
that would be a good thing and you know

3436
02:18:53,099 --> 02:18:56,460
the alternative personally is bad

3437
02:18:55,860 --> 02:18:58,290
because

3438
02:18:56,460 --> 02:18:59,760
psychological degeneration that goes

3439
02:18:58,290 --> 02:19:01,769
along with it I've seen this with many

3440
02:18:59,760 --> 02:19:03,840
many of the people that I work with who

3441
02:19:01,769 --> 02:19:05,599
have been terrorized in the workplace to

3442
02:19:03,840 --> 02:19:07,860
the absolute detriment of their

3443
02:19:05,599 --> 02:19:11,099
psychological and physical health right

3444
02:19:07,860 --> 02:19:13,469
to the point of collapse confronting

3445
02:19:11,099 --> 02:19:16,769
these crazy crazy things when they were

3446
02:19:13,469 --> 02:19:19,590
sensible people that's a terrible price

3447
02:19:16,769 --> 02:19:24,360
to pay man like it's it's a bad price

3448
02:19:19,590 --> 02:19:27,000
and then if the foolishness isn't dealt

3449
02:19:24,360 --> 02:19:29,519
with at the local level when it's still

3450
02:19:27,000 --> 02:19:31,380
relatively trivial then it will multiply

3451
02:19:29,519 --> 02:19:33,210
until it's dealt with at the social

3452
02:19:31,380 --> 02:19:36,769
level and we're seeing signs of that

3453
02:19:33,210 --> 02:19:39,240
already antiphon of that you know and

3454
02:19:36,769 --> 02:19:42,870
problems that aren't solved multiply and

3455
02:19:39,240 --> 02:19:45,840
soon people fight and you know better to

3456
02:19:42,870 --> 02:19:48,510
argue than to fight unless you want to

3457
02:19:45,840 --> 02:19:50,400
fight and some people want to fight and

3458
02:19:48,510 --> 02:19:57,720
I can understand why but I wouldn't

3459
02:19:50,400 --> 02:19:58,800
recommend it because that doesn't lead

3460
02:19:57,720 --> 02:20:00,960
good places

3461
02:19:58,800 --> 02:20:02,400
it really doesn't lead good places so

3462
02:20:00,960 --> 02:20:03,990
I'd say you have a duty maybe that's

3463
02:20:02,400 --> 02:20:05,940
that's where you stand up it's because

3464
02:20:03,990 --> 02:20:10,410
you have a goddamn duty to stand up and

3465
02:20:05,940 --> 02:20:11,910
say just say what you have to say if you

3466
02:20:10,410 --> 02:20:13,890
don't even have to be trying to make a

3467
02:20:11,910 --> 02:20:16,440
point exactly or trying to get something

3468
02:20:13,890 --> 02:20:19,020
done it's like this is how it looks to

3469
02:20:16,440 --> 02:20:20,970
me that's what that guy at Google did he

3470
02:20:19,020 --> 02:20:22,560
wrote this memo and he said I talked to

3471
02:20:20,970 --> 02:20:24,570
him today said well he went to a

3472
02:20:22,560 --> 02:20:28,020
diversity training seminar and he

3473
02:20:24,570 --> 02:20:30,570
thought no I don't agree with that and

3474
02:20:28,020 --> 02:20:32,760
so then they asked for feedback so we

3475
02:20:30,570 --> 02:20:35,160
wrote this document a month ago this was

3476
02:20:32,760 --> 02:20:37,500
written a month ago got no real response

3477
02:20:35,160 --> 02:20:39,840
to it but bounced around inside Google

3478
02:20:37,500 --> 02:20:41,460
until a lot of people you know got

3479
02:20:39,840 --> 02:20:45,330
interested and then it escaped into the

3480
02:20:41,460 --> 02:20:47,580
outside world but all he was doing was

3481
02:20:45,330 --> 02:20:49,470
he was told a bunch of things he didn't

3482
02:20:47,580 --> 02:20:51,960
think were true he wrote down a bunch of

3483
02:20:49,470 --> 02:20:53,460
things he thought were probably true he

3484
02:20:51,960 --> 02:20:55,770
launched that out and said well I think

3485
02:20:53,460 --> 02:21:00,479
these things are probably true it's like

3486
02:20:55,770 --> 02:21:02,220
well probably they're true well so he

3487
02:21:00,479 --> 02:21:03,780
paid a price for it but maybe we'll see

3488
02:21:02,220 --> 02:21:05,010
what sort of price he paid for it man

3489
02:21:03,780 --> 02:21:09,320
it's going to be a lot tougher in two

3490
02:21:05,010 --> 02:21:09,320
years than he was two years ago so

3491
02:21:11,370 --> 02:21:18,490
no they didn't answer his feedback

3492
02:21:13,870 --> 02:21:20,320
no no but well you can watch the video

3493
02:21:18,490 --> 02:21:23,050
the story's there but that's kind of the

3494
02:21:20,320 --> 02:21:24,610
outline of it so sorry to monopolize

3495
02:21:23,050 --> 02:21:27,150
this so I have one other question about

3496
02:21:24,610 --> 02:21:29,410
this and I think it's important

3497
02:21:27,150 --> 02:21:32,141
aside from Google just being a workplace

3498
02:21:29,410 --> 02:21:34,420
right it also controls the own YouTube

3499
02:21:32,141 --> 02:21:40,960
right yes which in order how is the new

3500
02:21:34,420 --> 02:21:43,271
censorship scheme and it controls a huge

3501
02:21:40,960 --> 02:21:46,150
amount of the information that people

3502
02:21:43,271 --> 02:21:50,800
get then so true and so what happens to

3503
02:21:46,150 --> 02:21:53,790
society when companies such as Google

3504
02:21:50,800 --> 02:21:57,160
which control our information start to

3505
02:21:53,790 --> 02:21:59,110
censor not just how about themselves and

3506
02:21:57,160 --> 02:22:00,521
and maybe the information that's coming

3507
02:21:59,110 --> 02:22:04,271
out to the rest of the world how much is

3508
02:22:00,521 --> 02:22:05,500
this already happening and how much how

3509
02:22:04,271 --> 02:22:08,470
about if we what happened how about if

3510
02:22:05,500 --> 02:22:10,870
we refused to find out that would be

3511
02:22:08,470 --> 02:22:13,650
good you know like I reviewed this this

3512
02:22:10,870 --> 02:22:16,720
guy's document I did that yesterday and

3513
02:22:13,650 --> 02:22:18,160
everything he said was validated by the

3514
02:22:16,720 --> 02:22:20,891
scientific literature so what has

3515
02:22:18,160 --> 02:22:23,681
happened is that someone has been fired

3516
02:22:20,891 --> 02:22:26,431
publicly by major corporation for

3517
02:22:23,681 --> 02:22:29,230
stating well-grounded scientific truths

3518
02:22:26,431 --> 02:22:30,880
right there are exactly the sorts of

3519
02:22:29,230 --> 02:22:32,320
things that I say in my classes for

3520
02:22:30,880 --> 02:22:33,790
example and the reason that I say them

3521
02:22:32,320 --> 02:22:35,980
is because I read the literature it's

3522
02:22:33,790 --> 02:22:38,771
not because I'm personally happy about

3523
02:22:35,980 --> 02:22:41,080
the facts I think I cube research

3524
02:22:38,771 --> 02:22:43,150
particularly is so dismal that you can't

3525
02:22:41,080 --> 02:22:45,550
possibly read it without being seriously

3526
02:22:43,150 --> 02:22:48,490
disheartened if I could reconstruct the

3527
02:22:45,550 --> 02:22:52,530
world so that IQ the IQ research wasn't

3528
02:22:48,490 --> 02:22:56,380
true well it'd sure be tempting you know

3529
02:22:52,530 --> 02:22:58,030
but that's not how science works science

3530
02:22:56,380 --> 02:22:59,650
doesn't tell you what you what you want

3531
02:22:58,030 --> 02:23:03,101
to hear it just tells you the way it

3532
02:22:59,650 --> 02:23:08,530
bloody well is and he got pilloried for

3533
02:23:03,101 --> 02:23:10,870
he got pilloried for revealing a good

3534
02:23:08,530 --> 02:23:14,050
fraction of current scientific knowledge

3535
02:23:10,870 --> 02:23:17,230
about gender differences okay that's not

3536
02:23:14,050 --> 02:23:18,460
good and as you said that's a big

3537
02:23:17,230 --> 02:23:22,670
company and it controls our

3538
02:23:18,460 --> 02:23:25,520
communication how about we do

3539
02:23:22,670 --> 02:23:28,430
what we can to ensure that these large

3540
02:23:25,520 --> 02:23:33,850
communication companies don't get to

3541
02:23:28,430 --> 02:23:37,729
impose a factually false ideological

3542
02:23:33,850 --> 02:23:39,950
structure on the rest of the planet well

3543
02:23:37,729 --> 02:23:41,420
you can think about supporting this this

3544
02:23:39,950 --> 02:23:43,790
guy who blew the whistle there's a

3545
02:23:41,420 --> 02:23:50,050
fundraiser for him online he could use

3546
02:23:43,790 --> 02:23:50,050
some money he wants to sue Google yeah

3547
02:23:51,640 --> 02:23:57,530
you know maybe we could maybe we could

3548
02:23:55,189 --> 02:24:00,500
let them know that hiring a human

3549
02:23:57,530 --> 02:24:02,660
resources director who's also concerned

3550
02:24:00,500 --> 02:24:05,360
with equity is probably not a good idea

3551
02:24:02,660 --> 02:24:08,210
for capitalist company why in the world

3552
02:24:05,360 --> 02:24:11,630
would you hire your own enemies I don't

3553
02:24:08,210 --> 02:24:14,240
understand that so well we'll see how

3554
02:24:11,630 --> 02:24:18,620
the dialogue continues but back to the

3555
02:24:14,240 --> 02:24:21,430
personal like you need to say what you

3556
02:24:18,620 --> 02:24:23,840
think because that's where you come from

3557
02:24:21,430 --> 02:24:26,120
right and if you don't say what you

3558
02:24:23,840 --> 02:24:28,310
think then you kill your unborn self

3559
02:24:26,120 --> 02:24:30,500
that's what you do that's what Cain did

3560
02:24:28,310 --> 02:24:32,630
when he killed Abel and that's why his

3561
02:24:30,500 --> 02:24:34,100
punishment was unbearable you know you

3562
02:24:32,630 --> 02:24:35,990
have things in you that are struggling

3563
02:24:34,100 --> 02:24:37,250
to come to the light that's the truth

3564
02:24:35,990 --> 02:24:39,229
you need daughter and you need to either

3565
02:24:37,250 --> 02:24:41,450
that truth because without that truth

3566
02:24:39,229 --> 02:24:43,370
you cannot live in the world because the

3567
02:24:41,450 --> 02:24:45,320
world is real and you need truth to live

3568
02:24:43,370 --> 02:24:48,290
in the world and if you stifle your

3569
02:24:45,320 --> 02:24:50,570
truth well how how can that be anything

3570
02:24:48,290 --> 02:24:53,090
but something that brings about hell how

3571
02:24:50,570 --> 02:24:54,800
could it be any other way so you think

3572
02:24:53,090 --> 02:24:56,689
well why should you speak up that's easy

3573
02:24:54,800 --> 02:25:00,439
because the consequences of not speaking

3574
02:24:56,689 --> 02:25:03,229
up although delayed are far worse that's

3575
02:25:00,439 --> 02:25:05,740
the reason that's the reason if it can't

3576
02:25:03,229 --> 02:25:09,729
be courage it could at least be prudence

3577
02:25:05,740 --> 02:25:09,729
so yeah

3578
02:25:15,120 --> 02:25:19,530
one more dr. Peterson

3579
02:25:18,149 --> 02:25:21,540
first of all kudos for mentioning

3580
02:25:19,530 --> 02:25:23,010
magnolias in my favorite movie that's a

3581
02:25:21,540 --> 02:25:26,510
great movie man

3582
02:25:23,010 --> 02:25:28,770
so a few months ago I had a dream and

3583
02:25:26,510 --> 02:25:30,149
when I told someone this dream they

3584
02:25:28,770 --> 02:25:31,080
suggested that I read the Book of

3585
02:25:30,149 --> 02:25:37,080
Revelations

3586
02:25:31,080 --> 02:25:39,450
oh yeah that's a bad dream that the

3587
02:25:37,080 --> 02:25:43,770
there's a lot of interesting stuff in

3588
02:25:39,450 --> 02:25:45,600
that book the thing that really that I

3589
02:25:43,770 --> 02:25:52,859
found really interesting right off the

3590
02:25:45,600 --> 02:25:55,890
bat was the the state is represented in

3591
02:25:52,859 --> 02:25:57,300
two instances as female positively and

3592
02:25:55,890 --> 02:25:59,460
negatively and I was wondering if you

3593
02:25:57,300 --> 02:26:02,100
had any thoughts on that in the context

3594
02:25:59,460 --> 02:26:05,100
of like in maps of meaning you often

3595
02:26:02,100 --> 02:26:09,630
talk about the state just as as male or

3596
02:26:05,100 --> 02:26:11,250
as masculine okay first of all I'm going

3597
02:26:09,630 --> 02:26:13,320
to comment on your t-shirt that's a

3598
02:26:11,250 --> 02:26:15,960
lobster hierarchy with Horus at the top

3599
02:26:13,320 --> 02:26:21,630
isn't it it's even better it's the eye

3600
02:26:15,960 --> 02:26:24,780
of a lobster so that's one that we found

3601
02:26:21,630 --> 02:26:26,550
yeah that's a good one that's a good one

3602
02:26:24,780 --> 02:26:28,050
that one really cracked me up when I saw

3603
02:26:26,550 --> 02:26:32,160
it I really thought that was funny man

3604
02:26:28,050 --> 02:26:33,990
yeah yeah yeah when my graduate students

3605
02:26:32,160 --> 02:26:36,570
used to meet when I first talked about

3606
02:26:33,990 --> 02:26:38,010
this Lobster stuff we meet for breakfast

3607
02:26:36,570 --> 02:26:40,350
day and they were a very combative

3608
02:26:38,010 --> 02:26:41,399
snappy group of graduate students and

3609
02:26:40,350 --> 02:26:43,710
they're always trying to one-up each

3610
02:26:41,399 --> 02:26:45,570
other with jokes and whenever one really

3611
02:26:43,710 --> 02:26:51,899
pulled a good joke on another they'd

3612
02:26:45,570 --> 02:26:54,260
stand up and like it was really it was

3613
02:26:51,899 --> 02:27:03,660
really funny it was really funny okay

3614
02:26:54,260 --> 02:27:05,880
let's see can I answer that question you

3615
02:27:03,660 --> 02:27:09,090
know how if you're looking at a if you

3616
02:27:05,880 --> 02:27:11,310
look at a room every color that you see

3617
02:27:09,090 --> 02:27:13,170
is dependent on every other color in the

3618
02:27:11,310 --> 02:27:14,640
room right your eyes adjust to that so

3619
02:27:13,170 --> 02:27:17,280
for example if you're in a room based

3620
02:27:14,640 --> 02:27:19,170
with red light your eyes will in some

3621
02:27:17,280 --> 02:27:23,340
sense remove the red so you can still

3622
02:27:19,170 --> 02:27:25,680
see the colors okay so your perception

3623
02:27:23,340 --> 02:27:28,550
is to some degree on-call is to some

3624
02:27:25,680 --> 02:27:30,470
degree dependent on Khan

3625
02:27:28,550 --> 02:27:32,090
context and that's one of the things

3626
02:27:30,470 --> 02:27:36,050
that makes the symbolic symbolic

3627
02:27:32,090 --> 02:27:37,310
interpretations tricky because to see

3628
02:27:36,050 --> 02:27:38,600
how something is represented

3629
02:27:37,310 --> 02:27:41,660
symbolically you actually have to look

3630
02:27:38,600 --> 02:27:44,630
at the broader narrative context within

3631
02:27:41,660 --> 02:27:50,319
which the symbols are embedded so for

3632
02:27:44,630 --> 02:27:50,319
example you see if I can get this right

3633
02:27:51,460 --> 02:27:58,280
if the story has an island and an ocean

3634
02:27:55,750 --> 02:28:00,020
then the ocean is often symbolically

3635
02:27:58,280 --> 02:28:02,240
feminine and the island is symbolically

3636
02:28:00,020 --> 02:28:05,149
masculine but if the story's the island

3637
02:28:02,240 --> 02:28:07,340
and the sky then Island often becomes

3638
02:28:05,149 --> 02:28:09,470
symbolically masculine and feminine and

3639
02:28:07,340 --> 02:28:10,850
the sky symbolically masculine and you

3640
02:28:09,470 --> 02:28:12,890
might think well how can the island be

3641
02:28:10,850 --> 02:28:14,930
masculine and feminine at the same time

3642
02:28:12,890 --> 02:28:17,300
and the answer is well it depends on

3643
02:28:14,930 --> 02:28:20,300
what what it's being contrasted with and

3644
02:28:17,300 --> 02:28:22,520
why and so that's part of the key to the

3645
02:28:20,300 --> 02:28:25,220
change in symbolism in the book of

3646
02:28:22,520 --> 02:28:28,609
Revelation and so it isn't inevitably

3647
02:28:25,220 --> 02:28:31,189
the case that culture is represented

3648
02:28:28,609 --> 02:28:34,370
with the patriarchal symbolism but it's

3649
02:28:31,189 --> 02:28:36,680
most commonly the case so you know there

3650
02:28:34,370 --> 02:28:38,540
is Mother Russia for example I guess it

3651
02:28:36,680 --> 02:28:40,729
would depend to some degree to on what

3652
02:28:38,540 --> 02:28:43,250
your metaphor is for the state because

3653
02:28:40,729 --> 02:28:49,100
the state can be in all providing mother

3654
02:28:43,250 --> 02:28:51,710
or it can be a judgmental father and it

3655
02:28:49,100 --> 02:28:53,920
it seems that we killed more towards the

3656
02:28:51,710 --> 02:28:56,300
father with regards to terminology

3657
02:28:53,920 --> 02:28:59,470
relating to the state and I think the

3658
02:28:56,300 --> 02:29:02,830
reason for that is because I think human

3659
02:28:59,470 --> 02:29:05,750
hierarchies like chimp hierarchies are

3660
02:29:02,830 --> 02:29:07,819
fundamentally masculine the fundamental

3661
02:29:05,750 --> 02:29:09,740
hierarchy is masculine even with chimps

3662
02:29:07,819 --> 02:29:12,740
there's a female hierarchy but it's like

3663
02:29:09,740 --> 02:29:14,510
the female hierarchy is nested within

3664
02:29:12,740 --> 02:29:16,760
the male hierarchy it's not the case

3665
02:29:14,510 --> 02:29:18,740
with bonobos exactly but I think it is

3666
02:29:16,760 --> 02:29:20,590
the case with human beings and so I

3667
02:29:18,740 --> 02:29:23,720
think we have a strong proclivity to

3668
02:29:20,590 --> 02:29:25,399
masculinize the state but that doesn't

3669
02:29:23,720 --> 02:29:27,560
mean there aren't exceptions and in

3670
02:29:25,399 --> 02:29:29,859
symbol symbolic representations are very

3671
02:29:27,560 --> 02:29:34,130
slippery that way because you can't

3672
02:29:29,859 --> 02:29:35,630
stamp an entity with a symbol because

3673
02:29:34,130 --> 02:29:38,330
that would be the same as just giving it

3674
02:29:35,630 --> 02:29:40,729
a name right and you can't have a

3675
02:29:38,330 --> 02:29:42,110
dictionary of symbols where you say well

3676
02:29:40,729 --> 02:29:44,030
you know a house

3677
02:29:42,110 --> 02:29:46,431
always means the psyche it's like know

3678
02:29:44,030 --> 02:29:49,940
sometimes the house means the psyche but

3679
02:29:46,431 --> 02:29:52,490
it depends on the story and so you have

3680
02:29:49,940 --> 02:29:55,460
to take the the entire structure of the

3681
02:29:52,490 --> 02:29:56,780
narrative into account to determine why

3682
02:29:55,460 --> 02:29:59,330
those particular symbolic

3683
02:29:56,780 --> 02:30:00,860
representations are being used what I

3684
02:29:59,330 --> 02:30:03,530
offered in maps a meaning was kind of a

3685
02:30:00,860 --> 02:30:05,841
shorthand you know generally speaking

3686
02:30:03,530 --> 02:30:07,820
there's nature positive and negative

3687
02:30:05,841 --> 02:30:09,591
usually feminine generally speaking

3688
02:30:07,820 --> 02:30:12,200
there's culture positive and negative

3689
02:30:09,591 --> 02:30:14,811
usually masculine and generally speaking

3690
02:30:12,200 --> 02:30:17,271
there's the individual good and evil

3691
02:30:14,811 --> 02:30:19,160
right heroic an adversarial often

3692
02:30:17,271 --> 02:30:23,061
typically represented as masculine

3693
02:30:19,160 --> 02:30:25,370
especially in adventure stories but it's

3694
02:30:23,061 --> 02:30:27,740
a schema and it's an interpretive guide

3695
02:30:25,370 --> 02:30:29,601
and not a set of hard and fast rules

3696
02:30:27,740 --> 02:30:33,351
because you're in the domain of metaphor

3697
02:30:29,601 --> 02:30:35,950
and it's a it's a slippery domain so you

3698
02:30:33,351 --> 02:30:38,360
have any luck figuring out your dream

3699
02:30:35,950 --> 02:30:43,660
sorry did you have any luck figuring out

3700
02:30:38,360 --> 02:30:46,580
your dream at least in some parts I

3701
02:30:43,660 --> 02:30:50,420
think there's different levels of

3702
02:30:46,580 --> 02:30:53,360
analysis I mean one was pretty obvious

3703
02:30:50,420 --> 02:30:54,290
yeah all right all right well thank you

3704
02:30:53,360 --> 02:31:01,479
very much everyone

3705
02:30:54,290 --> 02:31:01,479
[Applause]
