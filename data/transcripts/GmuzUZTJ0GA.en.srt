00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:09,949
[Music]

2
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:16,199
so I've been thinking this week about

3
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:20,119
doing this once a once a month on a

4
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:20,119
continuing basis

5
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,720
so so I I think if I do that I think

6
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,720
it'll be here although it's harder to

7
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:33,760
rent this theater during the academic

8
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,600
year but if it isn't here it'll be

9
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,960
somewhere else and because I'd like to

10
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,920
continue doing this I'm learning an

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,160
awful lot from doing it and and uh once

12
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,600
a month would really be good because

13
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:46,360
then I could really do the background

14
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,920
work and and uh and I could probably do

15
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:50,239
that for a couple of years because

16
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,120
obviously this isn't going very quickly

17
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:54,239
but that's okay you know I mean it

18
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:55,840
shouldn't go any faster than it can go

19
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,359
and that's how it that's how it seems to

20
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:01,920
me anyways

21
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:01,920
so uh

22
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,799
this has been this has

23
00:01:04,119 --> 00:01:08,360
been a a very steep learning curve for

24
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,439
me with regards to these stories because

25
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:12,119
I didn't understand them very well and

26
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:14,560
I've I've got better at using the

27
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:16,080
resources online to help me do my

28
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,560
background investigation I have a lot of

29
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:22,600
books and some of you may have noticed

30
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:25,119
that um online I posted a conversation I

31
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:29,479
had with Jonathan pasio and his and his

32
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:31,360
brother Matthew um I hope it's Matthew I

33
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:33,079
named escaped me so badly but I believe

34
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,360
that's right he just finished a book on

35
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:37,479
the on the Bible and so I've been doing

36
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,799
a lot of thinking and talking about

37
00:01:37,479 --> 00:01:42,159
these stories trying to understand what

38
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:44,360
they're about and and then there's all

39
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:47,119
these commentaries there's a a great

40
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:49,759
site I think it's called Bible Hub that

41
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:51,280
has every single verse of the Bible is

42
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:53,880
listed there and

43
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,520
then with each verse there are like

44
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,159
they've aggregated 10 commentaries from

45
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:01,439
about 10 commentaries from over the last

46
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:04,119
400 years and so there's like a dense

47
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,479
page on every line and that's one of the

48
00:02:04,119 --> 00:02:07,280
things that's really interesting about

49
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:09,720
this book too is that it's it's

50
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,280
aggregated so much commentary that it's

51
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:13,720
that it's it's much bigger than it looks

52
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:15,480
the book is much bigger than it looks

53
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:17,440
and so it's been very interesting to

54
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:19,040
become familiar with those too and the

55
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,680
fact that this site is set up with all

56
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,000
the commentaries split up by verses

57
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:24,160
means you can rapidly compare the

58
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
commentaries and get a sense of you know

59
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:27,519
how people have interpreted this over

60
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
well at least several hundred years but

61
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:30,920
of course much longer than that because

62
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,360
the people who wrote the commentaries

63
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:35,480
were of course reading things that were

64
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:38,480
older than that so that's been very very

65
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,480
interesting

66
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:44,440
um so last week we talked about a couple

67
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:46,280
of things we talked about how you might

68
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:48,720
understand the idea of a Divine

69
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:51,720
encounter and then we also paralleled

70
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,920
that with the idea that God disappears

71
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:56,720
in the Old Testament he he bows out as

72
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:59,159
the stories progress and that seems to

73
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,400
be a an emergent property of the

74
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:01,599
sequencing of the the stories right

75
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,040
because all the books were written by

76
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,879
independent people different people and

77
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:08,239
then they were aggregated by other

78
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:10,720
people and so the narrative continuity

79
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,560
is some kind of emergent property that's

80
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,879
that's a consequence of this interaction

81
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:17,480
between people readers and and writers

82
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:19,360
over centuries and it's it's strange

83
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:21,120
that given that there are also multiple

84
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,840
coherent narratives that unite it you

85
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,519
know it's really it's really not that

86
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:27,840
easy to understand that but it does at

87
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:30,400
least seem to be the case and so and the

88
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:34,959
third thing we talked about was that as

89
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:37,280
God bows out so to speak the the the the

90
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,920
individual personality seems of the of

91
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,319
the characters that are involved the

92
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,879
human characters that are involved seems

93
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,720
to become more and more developed and it

94
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,640
isn't exactly clear what that I mean

95
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,640
what it means is that God steps away and

96
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,319
man steps forward that's what it means

97
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:53,519
but why it's arranged like that or the

98
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:58,640
or the say ultimate significance of that

99
00:03:53,519 --> 00:04:00,239
is by no means clear and so so Abraham

100
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,200
who we're going to concentrate on today

101
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:06,280
is quite a well-developed character um

102
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:08,360
and I would say there are two there are

103
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,400
multiple endings and Beginnings in the

104
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:13,400
biblical Stories the most important

105
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:17,040
ending I suppose is the ending of the of

106
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:18,840
the garden of paradise and and the the

107
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,519
disenchantment of the world and the and

108
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:24,320
the sending forth of Adam and Eve into

109
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,919
history right into the future into into

110
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,720
a motive being that has a future as part

111
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:30,280
of it and that has history as part of it

112
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,479
and that has

113
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:34,280
the necessity of sacrifice and toil as

114
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:37,360
part of it that's obviously crucial and

115
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:38,840
then that's that is replayed with the

116
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,400
story of Noah because everything is

117
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,520
destroyed and then the world is created

118
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,120
a new and then sacrifices have to be

119
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:46,120
made in order for the world to begin and

120
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,759
then you see the same thing happen again

121
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:50,280
after the Noah story in the Tower of

122
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,039
Babel because history as we really

123
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:54,800
understand history seems to start with

124
00:04:52,039 --> 00:04:57,560
Abraham because the stories of Abraham

125
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,039
sound like historical stories and you

126
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:01,120
know Scholars debate about the

127
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:02,919
historical accuracy of the Bible and I

128
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,400
suppose there's there's no way of ever

129
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:07,199
determining once and for all the degree

130
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:09,880
to which you might regard the the

131
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:13,199
accounts as equivalent to Modern

132
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:15,080
empirical history but this is a

133
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,720
psychological interpretation of the

134
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:18,520
biblical story is not a historical

135
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,639
interpretation and it certainly does

136
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,840
seem to be the case that from a

137
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:23,639
psychological perspective we enter

138
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,440
something like the domain of the modern

139
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:28,000
conceptualization relatively modern

140
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,800
conceptualization of history with

141
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:32,360
Abraham beyond the of divine commands

142
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,280
that Abraham carries out this is from

143
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:36,199
fredman the man I mentioned in the last

144
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:38,919
lecture who wrote The Disappearance of

145
00:05:36,199 --> 00:05:40,560
God and a variety of other books um that

146
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:41,960
are well worth reading the narrative

147
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,479
also includes a variety of stories in

148
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:46,520
which Abraham acts on his own initiative

149
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,560
he divides land with his nephew lot he

150
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:51,120
battles Kings he takes concubines he

151
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,919
argues with his wife Sarah on two

152
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,800
occasion he tells kings that Sarah is

153
00:05:52,919 --> 00:05:56,919
his sister out of fear that they will

154
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,720
kill him to get his wife he arranges his

155
00:05:56,919 --> 00:06:00,440
son's marriage in the place of the

156
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,360
single story of Noah drunkenness there

157
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:04,319
are in the case of Abraham the stories

158
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:06,800
of a man's life and one of the things I

159
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:09,440
was really struck by reading this in

160
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:13,080
depth and reading the commentary is how

161
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:15,280
much like a story about a person it is

162
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:18,199
you know Abraham isn't a Divine figure

163
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:19,599
in in any in in any archetypal sense

164
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:21,120
precisely I mean he has archetypal

165
00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:23,800
elements because he's

166
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:26,639
also obviously the founder of a Nation

167
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,720
but fundamentally he's a human being and

168
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,440
and he makes he has the adventures and

169
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:32,319
he makes the mistakes of a human being

170
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:35,440
and that's it's the mistake part that

171
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,440
really struck me you know

172
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:40,919
because I was talking with a friend of

173
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:43,599
mine this week Norman dege uh who's a

174
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:45,319
very remarkable person in many ways and

175
00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:47,000
he was taking me to task he was reading

176
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:49,120
my book which I'm going to publish or

177
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:51,680
which will be out in January and in in

178
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,120
the book I I in one section I contrasted

179
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,639
the god of the Old Testament with the

180
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:58,280
god of the New Testament and made the

181
00:06:55,639 --> 00:07:00,039
case sort of based on northr Fry's ideas

182
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:02,160
that the god of the Old Testament was

183
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:04,199
really harsh and judgmental you know and

184
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:07,199
that the god of the New Testament was

185
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:09,160
more merciful and you know at least to

186
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:11,440
some degree more sweetness and light and

187
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:13,879
Norman took me to task about that saying

188
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,560
that that was a an overly christianized

189
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:17,360
interpretation which would make sense

190
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:20,160
because I derived it in part from northr

191
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:22,240
fry and I really have come to understand

192
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:24,440
that more that that he's right because

193
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:26,720
that he's right about that because the

194
00:07:24,440 --> 00:07:28,560
god in the Old Testament is actually far

195
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,800
more merciful than he's generally made

196
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,759
out to be and you really see see this

197
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:35,360
with it's good news fundamentally if you

198
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:37,599
regard the representation of God as

199
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,680
somehow key to the description of being

200
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:42,360
itself I mean Abraham makes a lot of

201
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,280
mistakes you know serious mistakes and

202
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:46,039
and yet he has a life and he's and he's

203
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:48,280
blessed by God despite the fact that

204
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:49,960
he's pretty deeply flawed and engages in

205
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,599
deceptive practice I mean he's a good

206
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:53,520
man but he's not a perfect man by any

207
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,960
stretch of the imagination and and

208
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,639
things work out really well for him and

209
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:58,360
he's the founder of a nation and all of

210
00:07:56,639 --> 00:08:00,319
that and that's good news for everyone

211
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:03,080
because perfect people are very very

212
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:05,960
hard to find and if the the the the the

213
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:08,520
only Pathway to having a rich and

214
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:10,720
meaningful life was through Perfection

215
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:12,840
then we would all be in deep trouble and

216
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:16,039
so that that's very satisfying to read

217
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:17,840
that and um the the other other thing

218
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:19,639
that I've been struck by is that you

219
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,639
know Abraham and I think this is

220
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:23,759
actually absolutely key to the

221
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:26,720
interpretation of the story Abraham goes

222
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:28,360
out and does things that's the thing and

223
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,000
so one of the things that I've noticed

224
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:33,200
in my life is that

225
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:35,760
nothing I've ever done was wasted and by

226
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:39,200
done I mean put my heart and soul into

227
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:42,039
you know like like attempted with with

228
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:43,440
all of my effort that that always worked

229
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:44,800
now it didn't always work the way I

230
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,519
expected it to work that's a whole

231
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:50,240
different issue but the payoff from it

232
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,200
was always positive I always something

233
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,120
always something of value always accured

234
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:56,800
to me when I made the sacrifice is

235
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:58,600
necessary to do something worthwhile and

236
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:00,279
so I think part of the message in in

237
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:04,440
this in the story of in the abrahamic

238
00:09:00,279 --> 00:09:06,480
stories is go do something and and I've

239
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:08,200
I've thought about this in a variety of

240
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,920
ways outside of the interpretation of

241
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,680
this story because I have this program

242
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,519
some of you might be familiar with which

243
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,920
is called future authoring program and

244
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:19,079
it's it's designed to help people make a

245
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:21,600
plan for 3 to five years into the future

246
00:09:19,079 --> 00:09:24,320
you know and we so what you do is you

247
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:27,000
you answer some questions it's a writing

248
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,839
program you answer some questions about

249
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,800
how you would like your life to be and

250
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:32,920
what you would like your character to be

251
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:34,519
3 to 5 years down the road if you were

252
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:35,880
taking care of yourself like you were

253
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:37,880
taking care of someone that you actually

254
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:39,839
cared about so you kind of have to split

255
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:41,920
yourself into two people and treat

256
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:43,360
yourself like you like someone you have

257
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,279
respect for and that you want the best

258
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,120
for that's not easy because people don't

259
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,640
necessarily have respect for themselves

260
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,279
and they don't necessarily want what's

261
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,760
the best for themselves because they

262
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:53,720
they have a lot of self-contempt and a

263
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:56,200
lot of self-hatred a lot of guilt and a

264
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:58,560
lot of existential angst and and a lot

265
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:00,480
of self-consciousness and all of that

266
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,440
and and so people don't necessarily take

267
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:04,279
care of themselves very well and and I

268
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:06,360
think it's I think it's I think you have

269
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:08,680
an obligation it's one of the highest

270
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:11,320
moral obligations to treat yourself as

271
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:13,720
if you're a creature of value and and

272
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:15,600
that is in some sense it's in some sense

273
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:16,640
that's independent of your actions and

274
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,480
you might think about that

275
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,600
metaphorically as a recognition of your

276
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:24,040
Divine worth in the biblical sense

277
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,320
regardless of your of your sin so to

278
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:27,680
speak and I think that's that's that's

279
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,079
powerful language as far as I'm

280
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,519
concerned once you understand it anyways

281
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:34,079
with the self-authoring program the

282
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:37,600
future authoring program you you ask you

283
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:38,880
answer questions about what what how you

284
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,560
would like your friendships to be

285
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,959
conducted because it's useful to

286
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,480
surround yourself with people who are

287
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:45,720
trying to move forward and and more

288
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:47,880
importantly who are happy when you move

289
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,720
forward and not happy when you move back

290
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,360
backwards not when you fall that isn't

291
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,800
what I mean but when you're doing

292
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,560
self-destructive things your friends

293
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,760
shouldn't be there to cheer you on and

294
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,320
because then they're really not acting

295
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:00,200
like friends obviously you know I know

296
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,639
it's obvious but it still happens all

297
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:03,519
the time and people allow it to happen

298
00:11:01,639 --> 00:11:06,600
it's not a good idea and you know how

299
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:08,160
would you like to sort your family out

300
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,839
and I was thinking about this this week

301
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,200
too because I was thinking about Noah's

302
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,600
Arc and there was a phrase in that story

303
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,200
that I didn't understand which was that

304
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,480
Noah was perfect in his Generations I

305
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,240
thought I don't know what that means and

306
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:20,480
you know when you're when you're going

307
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,920
through a book like the Bible if you

308
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,800
don't understand a phrase that actually

309
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,519
means you've missed something it doesn't

310
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,079
mean that that's just not you know

311
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,519
that's not gerine to the story it means

312
00:11:27,079 --> 00:11:31,800
you're stupid you didn't get it man you

313
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,040
didn't get it you didn't understand it

314
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,760
and

315
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,800
so the idea that Noah was perfect in his

316
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:40,079
generations and that's why he could

317
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:42,839
build an ark that would sustain him and

318
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:45,279
him and and Humanity itself through the

319
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:46,600
flood it meant that he not only did he

320
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,240
walk with God which was something that

321
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:49,680
we talked about in in the context of The

322
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,399
Sermon on the Mount but that he

323
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:54,079
established proper relationships with

324
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:56,440
his family with his children and so what

325
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:58,519
that meant was that his Not only was he

326
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:59,920
well integrated as a person but his

327
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:01,480
level of integration had reached the

328
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:04,120
point where it stretched out Beyond him

329
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:06,040
and encompassed his family and so it was

330
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,519
Noah and the family that was in the ark

331
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:09,399
and I can tell you and I really

332
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:11,240
understood this this year because I had

333
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:12,959
a very tumultuous year you could think

334
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:14,560
about it from a personal perspective I

335
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,959
could think about it as a year that had

336
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:19,639
no shortage of floods and my and part of

337
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:21,519
the reason that I was able to get

338
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:23,560
through it I also had terrible health

339
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:25,279
problems and the only one of the reasons

340
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:27,720
I was able to get through it was because

341
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:30,160
my family really came together around me

342
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:33,959
my kids my wife my parents and and and

343
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:37,000
my friends as well and particularly a

344
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:38,680
certain group of friends and that's

345
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,880
partly all of that came together in my

346
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:41,920
mind this week and I thought oh that's

347
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:43,760
what it means to be perfect in his

348
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,320
Generations meant that he hadn't just

349
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:48,760
straightened himself out he'd also

350
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:51,000
straightened out his relationships with

351
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:54,240
his family and I can tell you that when

352
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:56,000
crisis strikes you which it will it will

353
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,760
the flood will come right that's why the

354
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,800
apocalypse is always upon us the flood

355
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,680
will definitely come in your life and to

356
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:04,320
the degree that you've organized

357
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:06,320
yourself psychologically and also healed

358
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,040
the relationships between you and your

359
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,760
family that could be the critical

360
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:11,800
element that that determines whether you

361
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,279
live or die when a crisis comes or or

362
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:15,760
whether someone in your family lives or

363
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:18,000
dies and so the idea of the the ark

364
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:19,760
containing the man who's who walks with

365
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:22,079
God and whose Generations are perfect

366
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:23,600
and that that's what sustains Humanity

367
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:25,399
through the crisis it's like you

368
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,480
couldn't be more psychologically

369
00:13:25,399 --> 00:13:30,040
accurate than that you know the other

370
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:32,000
thing I was thinking about this week I

371
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:33,680
I was thinking about another line in the

372
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,920
New Testament I think it's from The

373
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:37,440
Sermon on the Mount but I'm not

374
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:40,040
absolutely sure Christ

375
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:42,160
compares the Kingdom of Heaven to a

376
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:43,760
mustard seed and so I was thinking about

377
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:45,839
a mustard seed is a very tiny seed and

378
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:49,320
it grows into quite a spectacular

379
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:51,279
complex plant and I was thinking about

380
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:53,519
how you should operate in the world in

381
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:55,079
order to make it a better place assuming

382
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,440
that that's what you should be doing and

383
00:13:55,079 --> 00:13:59,199
that that is what you should be doing

384
00:13:56,440 --> 00:14:01,240
and there there's lots in the world to

385
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:03,639
fix everything that bothers you about

386
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:07,399
the world and about yourself should be

387
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:10,759
fixed and you can do that and my Dawning

388
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:12,880
realization I have a friend he lives in

389
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:14,839
Montreal his name is James Simon he's a

390
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,720
great painter and he's taught me a lot

391
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:19,519
of things help he's helped me design my

392
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,959
house and beautify it and I bought some

393
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:24,040
paintings from him a couple of years ago

394
00:14:21,959 --> 00:14:26,240
um and he did this series of paintings

395
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:28,519
where he went around North America and

396
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:31,600
and stood in different places and then

397
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:34,120
he painted the view from here down and

398
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:36,160
so it's his feet planted in different

399
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:38,199
places on roads in the desert on the

400
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,040
ocean I have one actually hanging over

401
00:14:38,199 --> 00:14:43,120
my toilet which is him standing at a

402
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:44,880
urinal um yeah well you know he was

403
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,240
trying to make a point and the point was

404
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:49,160
that wherever you are it's worth paying

405
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:51,160
attention and that's because you know so

406
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:53,600
all these places that he visited he

407
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:55,399
looked exactly where he was standing by

408
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,680
the side of the road in the desert sort

409
00:14:55,399 --> 00:14:59,600
of mundane in some sense but then maybe

410
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,920
he put 40 hours into that that painting

411
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:02,440
you know and it's it's very very

412
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:04,519
realistic painting with really good

413
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:06,720
light and what he's telling you as a

414
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:09,040
painter is everything is worth paying

415
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:11,079
attention to an infinite amount but you

416
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,720
don't have enough time and so the artist

417
00:15:11,079 --> 00:15:14,680
does that for you right the artist looks

418
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,480
and looks and looks and looks and looks

419
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:17,800
and then gives you that vision and so

420
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,040
then you can look at the painting and it

421
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:22,759
reminds you that right where you are is

422
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,920
there's every everything that there is

423
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:27,160
is right where you are and that's a hard

424
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:29,759
thing to realize but it's actually true

425
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:31,920
and so I've I've been telling people

426
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,399
online in various ways and in lectures

427
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,880
that they should start fixing up the

428
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:37,440
World by cleaning up their room and I

429
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,759
wanted to just elaborate on that a

430
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:43,079
little bit before I get back to the

431
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:46,639
lecture itself so as it's become this

432
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:49,680
internet weird internet meme you know uh

433
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:51,720
and and and and and it's a joke and good

434
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:53,319
it's a joke I good I'm really happy

435
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,360
about the fact that so much of this has

436
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:57,040
got like the leave-in of humor and it's

437
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:59,720
really important because that's what

438
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:02,279
stops things from degenerating into into

439
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:04,000
conflict to humor and I was thinking

440
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:06,000
about this idea of cleaning up your room

441
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:08,040
in relationship to the Mustard Seed idea

442
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:10,040
and you see the thing about cleaning up

443
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:12,199
your room this is also something I

444
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:15,199
learned from Carl Jung and his studies

445
00:16:12,199 --> 00:16:16,800
on Alchemy because for Yung when The

446
00:16:15,199 --> 00:16:18,399
Alchemist was attempting to make the

447
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,040
philosopher stone he was not only

448
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:21,720
engaged in the transformation of the

449
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:24,199
material world but he was engaged in a

450
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:26,839
process of self- transformation that

451
00:16:24,199 --> 00:16:28,399
occurred at the same time as the as the

452
00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:30,360
chemical trans as the chemical

453
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:32,600
transformation so it's a psychological

454
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:34,279
work in some sense let's say you want to

455
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:36,000
sort out your room and beautify it

456
00:16:34,279 --> 00:16:37,360
because the beauty is also important and

457
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,079
let's say that all you have is just a

458
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,920
little room like you're not rich you're

459
00:16:39,079 --> 00:16:42,199
you're poor and and you don't have any

460
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:44,120
power that's another thing but you've

461
00:16:42,199 --> 00:16:45,759
got your damn room and you've got this

462
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:48,079
space right in front of you you know

463
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:50,199
that that that's a part of the cosmos

464
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:51,720
that you can come to grips with and you

465
00:16:50,199 --> 00:16:53,399
might think well what's there in front

466
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:55,199
of you right in front of you and the

467
00:16:53,399 --> 00:16:57,360
answer to that is it depends on how open

468
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:59,800
your eyes are that's the proper answer

469
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:02,199
because you could say and William Blake

470
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:03,680
said this for example and eldis Huxley

471
00:17:02,199 --> 00:17:05,959
made comments that were very similar

472
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:08,160
that in a Transcendent State you can see

473
00:17:05,959 --> 00:17:10,079
Infinity in the finite and you might say

474
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,360
well you can say in you can see infinity

475
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:13,959
and what you have within your grasp if

476
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:16,640
you look and you could say maybe that's

477
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:19,360
the case with your room and so you want

478
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:22,360
to clean up your room well okay how do

479
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:24,760
you do that exactly well a room is a

480
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:26,400
room is a place to sleep and so if you

481
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:27,720
set your room up properly then you

482
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,840
figure out how to sleep and when you

483
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:31,440
should sleep and you should sleep and

484
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:32,760
then you figure out when you should wake

485
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,960
up and then you figure out well what

486
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,360
clothes you should wear because they

487
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,520
have to be arranged properly in your

488
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:38,000
dresser and then you have to have some

489
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,919
place to put your clothes if you're

490
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,840
going to have some clothes you have to

491
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:42,440
figure out what you're going to wear

492
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,480
those clothes to do right and then that

493
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:45,520
means you have to figure out what you're

494
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:47,320
going to do and then your room has to

495
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:49,520
serve that purpose because otherwise it

496
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:51,799
isn't set up properly and if it doesn't

497
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:54,240
set up if it doesn't serve your per

498
00:17:51,799 --> 00:17:55,840
purposes you will be unhappy and not

499
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:59,360
happy in the room because the way that

500
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:02,559
we perceive the world is as a place to

501
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:05,400
move from point A to point B in and then

502
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:07,120
if the place that we're in facilitates

503
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,320
that movement then we're happy to be

504
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:11,440
there and if the place that we're in

505
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:13,880
serves as an obstacle to that movement

506
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:15,320
then we're unhappy to be there and so

507
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:17,440
what it means to set up your room is

508
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:19,120
that you have to have somewhere to go

509
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,400
that's worthwhile or you can't set up

510
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:23,120
your room and then your room has to be

511
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,480
set up to facilitate that and then the

512
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:26,640
next thing is well maybe you have to

513
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:27,960
make it beautiful but that's not easy

514
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,720
right that means you have to have some

515
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:32,000
taste and that doesn't mean you have to

516
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:34,320
have money it doesn't because you can be

517
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:36,919
garish with money and you can be

518
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,679
tasteful with nothing all you need is

519
00:18:36,919 --> 00:18:40,320
taste and taste beats money when it

520
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:42,000
comes to beautifying things you know I

521
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:44,360
mean not that money is Trivial because

522
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:46,760
it's not but taste is crucial and people

523
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:48,440
who are very artistically oriented can

524
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:50,520
make beautiful things out of virtually

525
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:52,120
nothing and not only that the literature

526
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,960
suggests that if you're going to make

527
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:55,760
beautiful things putting real

528
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:58,120
constraints on on what you allow

529
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,880
yourself to do facilitates creativity

530
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:01,400
instead of inter interfering with it

531
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:03,520
because let's say you have to make

532
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:06,039
something out of nothing right which I

533
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:07,600
suppose would be a Godly act right you

534
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:09,400
have to make something out of nothing it

535
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,880
you have to be creative in order to do

536
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:14,360
that and so then to to beautify your

537
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:16,480
room means that you also have to develop

538
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:18,000
Your Capacity to be creative and so then

539
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:21,360
you can make your

540
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:23,000
room shine but then what will happen is

541
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:24,600
that if your family isn't together they

542
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,360
will interfere with that you'll

543
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:27,840
interfere with that because you won't

544
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:29,960
have the discipline to do it properly

545
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:33,080
but then when you start building this

546
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:35,360
this this little microcosm of perfection

547
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:37,360
with what you have at hand then it'll

548
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,559
evoke all the pathologies of everyone in

549
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,000
your household they'll wonder what the

550
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:42,120
hell you're up to in there and they

551
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,720
won't necessarily be happy because if

552
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:46,080
you're if they're in a lowly Place let's

553
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:48,679
say and so are you and you're trying to

554
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,320
move out of that then the the higher you

555
00:19:48,679 --> 00:19:52,679
move out of that the more the place

556
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:54,120
they're in looks bad and you might say

557
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:56,400
well what they should do is celebrate

558
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:57,760
your victory over chaos and evil but

559
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:59,640
that isn't what will happen what will

560
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:02,240
happen instead is that will attempt to

561
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:04,200
pull you back down they'll attempt to

562
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,960
and I mean obviously All Families don't

563
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:09,440
do that but but all families do that to

564
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:11,880
some degree and some families do almost

565
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:13,960
nothing but that and so what that means

566
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:15,799
is that if you're going to organize your

567
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:17,880
room then you're going to have to

568
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:20,080
confront the devils in your house and

569
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:22,120
that's often that's often a terrifying

570
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,520
thing because some of those Devils have

571
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:26,919
have lineages that go back many many

572
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:28,280
many generations and God only knows what

573
00:20:26,919 --> 00:20:31,480
you have to struggle with in order to

574
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:33,760
overcome that and so and then and so to

575
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:36,280
sort yourself out and to fix up your

576
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:39,120
room is a non-trivial matter you know

577
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:40,559
and you you can do that you'll learn by

578
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,200
doing that and then maybe you'll learn

579
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:44,120
Enough by doing that so that you can fix

580
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,640
up your family a little bit and then

581
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:47,360
having done that you'll have enough

582
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:49,159
character so that when you try to

583
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:51,760
operate in the world at your job or

584
00:20:49,159 --> 00:20:53,480
maybe in the broader social spheres that

585
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,919
you'll be a force for good instead of

586
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:57,600
harm because you'll have learned some

587
00:20:54,919 --> 00:21:00,000
humility by noting just how difficult it

588
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:01,919
was to put your damn room together well

589
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,240
and yourself for that matter and so

590
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:08,559
you'll proceed cautiously with your eyes

591
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:10,320
open towards the good and so well I

592
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,919
those are some of the things I've been

593
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:13,559
thinking about this week and they're

594
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,960
germine they're like they're Germain to

595
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:17,039
what we're going to discuss tonight

596
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:19,279
because what happens at the beginning of

597
00:21:17,039 --> 00:21:22,159
the abrahamic story is basically God

598
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:25,240
comes to Abraham and just says

599
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:27,559
go get going man do something do

600
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:30,520
something get going and you might think

601
00:21:27,559 --> 00:21:32,120
well where should I go and God God is

602
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:33,919
somewhat vague about that and where he

603
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:36,000
sends Abraham it's it's a real fixer

604
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:37,799
upper man it's like there's starvation

605
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:39,679
there and and there's tyranny and

606
00:21:37,799 --> 00:21:42,120
there's and there's marital dissolution

607
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:43,679
and there's deceit like it's it's just

608
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:45,960
like where you live you know it's

609
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:48,679
exactly the same thing it's it's it's

610
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:50,840
tyranny and catastrophe so that's you

611
00:21:48,679 --> 00:21:52,919
know the the great the tyrannical great

612
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:56,039
father because because Abraham ends up

613
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:57,640
having to sojourn in Egypt and and

614
00:21:56,039 --> 00:22:00,080
there's a famine and so mother nature is

615
00:21:57,640 --> 00:22:02,159
on the Rampage Abraham lies about his

616
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,400
wife as we'll see and so it's it's the

617
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:07,120
world it's the world it's tyranny and

618
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:10,880
and vulnerability and deceit and yet God

619
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:13,360
says go because if you do go then you'll

620
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,960
become a father of Nations and you think

621
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:16,559
well again that's pretty good news

622
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,679
although it's strange because you'd

623
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:20,320
expect that if God chose Abraham then

624
00:22:18,679 --> 00:22:22,679
he'd send him immediately to the land of

625
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,279
Honey land of milk and honey and that

626
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:26,720
isn't what happens at all it doesn't

627
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:29,279
happen at all and Abraham never gets

628
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:32,240
there but his mission is still regarded

629
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:34,000
as Divine and thank God for that because

630
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,200
that's what your mission will be because

631
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,159
that's what you will encounter in your

632
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:39,159
life those are the AR archetypal things

633
00:22:37,159 --> 00:22:41,120
everyone encounters the tyranny of the

634
00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:43,200
social structure and the and the

635
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,600
rapaciousness of Nature and the

636
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:48,000
deceitful the deceitful quality of the

637
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:50,039
human psyche it's like that's the world

638
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:52,279
now it's a negative that's a negative

639
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:54,679
view in some sense but it's positive in

640
00:22:52,279 --> 00:22:56,360
the story because what it basically says

641
00:22:54,679 --> 00:22:57,960
is something that's akin to The Sermon

642
00:22:56,360 --> 00:23:00,440
on the Mount which is that if you're

643
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:03,880
aligned with God and you pay attention

644
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:05,600
to the Divine injunction then you can

645
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:08,799
operate in the midst of chaos and

646
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:10,520
tyranny and deception and flourish and

647
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:12,039
you could hardly hope to have a better

648
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:15,400
piece of news than that given that

649
00:23:12,039 --> 00:23:16,919
that's exactly where you are so and I

650
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:19,000
didn't see any of that in the abrahamic

651
00:23:16,919 --> 00:23:22,240
stories to begin with so it's been very

652
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:24,919
interesting to have that sort of reveal

653
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:27,000
itself the Abraham section thus develops

654
00:23:24,919 --> 00:23:30,440
the personality and character of a man

655
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:33,480
to a new degree in bibl

656
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:35,880
narrative while picturing him in a new

657
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:37,600
degree of responsibility in him a new

658
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:39,360
degree of responsibility so here's the

659
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,279
other thing that's really struck me and

660
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,720
I think this is of absolutely crucial

661
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:44,720
importance and I I don't know how much

662
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:47,640
importance but it's certainly important

663
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:49,480
to me one of the things that has just

664
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:51,600
blown me away in the last year because

665
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:53,440
I've talked to lots of people lots of

666
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:55,760
people live you know but also lots of

667
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:57,640
people online but it's more obvious live

668
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,799
and it's obvious in this theater as well

669
00:23:57,640 --> 00:24:02,919
is that I I've i' I've gone around and

670
00:23:59,799 --> 00:24:05,520
spoken and a large proportion of my

671
00:24:02,919 --> 00:24:09,480
audience has been young men y you know

672
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:11,360
under 30 something like that and I've

673
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:14,320
spoken to them a lot about

674
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:16,960
responsibility and what's so odd about

675
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:18,480
about this is that of all the things

676
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,799
that I've spoken about because I can see

677
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,080
the audience and I can feel how the

678
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:23,679
audience is reacting because I'm always

679
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:26,000
paying attention to all of you in so far

680
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:28,880
as I can manage that so I I get some

681
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,840
sense of how what I'm saying is

682
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:32,159
Landing you know which you have to do if

683
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:34,679
you're going to speak effectively to

684
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:37,080
people and what what happens is if I

685
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:40,159
talk about responsibilities everyone be

686
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:43,200
is silent just like they are now silent

687
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:46,000
and and not moving right focusing

688
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,679
attentive say pick up your

689
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:50,000
responsibility pick up the heaviest

690
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:51,720
thing you can and carry it and the room

691
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:56,080
goes quiet and everybody's eyes open and

692
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:59,700
I think that always makes me break

693
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:03,390
up I was

694
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:03,390
[Applause]

695
00:25:06,399 --> 00:25:10,840
I don't I don't know why I was speaking

696
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:12,320
to an English journalist today who's

697
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:13,799
going to write an article in ins

698
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:16,279
spectator magazine and I was talking

699
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:17,960
about this and at the same point in the

700
00:25:16,279 --> 00:25:19,880
discussion the same I had the same

701
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:21,720
emotional reaction I don't really

702
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:23,399
understand it it's I think it's

703
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:25,640
something there's something about it

704
00:25:23,399 --> 00:25:27,960
that's so crucial because you know we've

705
00:25:25,640 --> 00:25:29,799
been fed this unending diet of Rights

706
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:32,000
and freedoms and there's something about

707
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:34,360
that especially there's something about

708
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:36,320
that that's so pathologically wrong and

709
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:39,679
people are starving for the antidote and

710
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:41,600
the antidote is truth and responsibility

711
00:25:39,679 --> 00:25:43,720
right and it it isn't it isn't because

712
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,720
that's what you should do in some you

713
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:48,760
know in

714
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:51,320
some some I know better or someone knows

715
00:25:48,760 --> 00:25:53,399
better for you what you should do sense

716
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:55,200
it's that it's that it's that it's that

717
00:25:53,399 --> 00:25:56,840
that's the secret to a meaningful life

718
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,240
and without a meaningful life then all

719
00:25:56,840 --> 00:26:00,640
you have is suffering and and nihilism

720
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:03,279
and despair and all of that and

721
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:07,000
self-contempt and and that's not good

722
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:09,559
and so the men it's necessary for men to

723
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:12,840
stand up and take responsibility and

724
00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:15,039
they all know that and and are starving

725
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:16,919
for that message and and the message is

726
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:18,919
more that that's also a good thing to

727
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:21,960
stand up and take responsibility because

728
00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:23,960
you're cursed so much now from from from

729
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:25,880
from when you're young with this notion

730
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:28,440
that your active engagement with the

731
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:30,360
world is part of what is destroying and

732
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:32,480
undermining the planet and adding to the

733
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:34,559
tyranny of the social systems it's like

734
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,960
how about not so much of that hey

735
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:38,799
because it's it's it's too Soul

736
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:41,399
deadening it's anti-human right to the

737
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:44,600
core and my sense instead is that you

738
00:26:41,399 --> 00:26:46,559
know if you if you were able to reveal

739
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:49,279
the best of yourself to you in the world

740
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:52,159
that you would be an overwhelming Force

741
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:54,360
for good and that whatever errors might

742
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:55,760
be made along the way would wash out in

743
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,399
the works and that's the other thing

744
00:26:55,760 --> 00:27:00,159
that you see in the abrahamic stories

745
00:26:57,399 --> 00:27:01,840
because Abraham is not a perfect person

746
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:04,520
by any stretch of the imagination he's a

747
00:27:01,840 --> 00:27:06,240
real person and he makes mistakes but it

748
00:27:04,520 --> 00:27:09,440
doesn't matter the overarching narrative

749
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:13,360
is you know maintain your Covenant with

750
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:14,919
God and despite your inadequacies then

751
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:17,320
not only will you Prevail but your

752
00:27:14,919 --> 00:27:19,600
descendants will prevail it's like great

753
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:21,960
that's really good news you know so it's

754
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:26,240
been really something to see that in the

755
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:28,200
in the stories it's not that so that's

756
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:30,480
responsibility it's not just that

757
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:32,080
Abraham is Kinder gentler more intrepid

758
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:34,399
ethical or a better debater than his

759
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,880
ancestor Noah rather both the Noah and

760
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:37,640
Abraham stories are pieces of a

761
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:40,399
development of an increasingly stronger

762
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:42,320
stance of humans relative to the deity

763
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:44,279
before the story is over humans will

764
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,880
become a good deal stronger and Bolder

765
00:27:44,279 --> 00:27:47,440
than Abraham well that's really

766
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:50,480
something to say because Abraham is

767
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:53,440
pretty bold so we'll let's read the

768
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:55,519
stories the first one is about Abraham

769
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:58,760
Sarah and lot now these are the

770
00:27:55,519 --> 00:28:00,559
generations of Tara Tara begat Abraham

771
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:02,080
so his name is Abraham to begin with and

772
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:04,440
that actually turns out to be important

773
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:07,799
it's not Abraham nahor and Heron and

774
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:09,919
Heron begat lot so Heron is Abram's

775
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:12,600
brother and Heron died before his father

776
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:15,080
Tara in the land of his Nativity in ER

777
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:17,679
of the chelis and Abram and nahor took

778
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:20,840
them wives the name of Abram's wife was

779
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:22,440
Sarai and the name of nahor's wife milka

780
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:25,519
the daughter of Heron the father of

781
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:28,840
milka and the father of isca but Sarai

782
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:31,159
was Barren she had no child and Tara

783
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:33,519
took Abram his son and lot the son of

784
00:28:31,159 --> 00:28:35,640
Heron his son's son and Sarai his

785
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:37,200
daughter-in-law his son Abram's wife and

786
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:39,519
they went forth with them from the ER of

787
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,799
chelis from ER of the chelis to go into

788
00:28:39,519 --> 00:28:43,360
the land of Canaan that's Exile and they

789
00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:45,880
came unto Heron and dwelt there and the

790
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:48,559
days of Tera were 205 years and terara

791
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:51,640
died in Heron and there's a reason that

792
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:53,480
Sarah is is introduced as Barren and and

793
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:55,559
it's it's to set the stage I think it

794
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:58,279
was Anton COV who when he was talking

795
00:28:55,559 --> 00:29:00,039
about this the stage setting for a play

796
00:28:58,279 --> 00:29:02,320
that if there was a rifle hanging on the

797
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:03,919
wall then it had better been used before

798
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:05,840
I believe the second act or it shouldn't

799
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:08,399
be hanging there at all right and so

800
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:10,519
this is stage setting and I part of the

801
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:12,600
reason that the biblical writers are

802
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:14,519
pointing out that Abram's wife is Barren

803
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:17,600
is because it's a real catastrophy for

804
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:20,399
Abraham and for Sarah as well that she's

805
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,760
Barren and so it's it's showing the

806
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:24,480
trouble that Abraham's in at the

807
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:25,399
beginning of the story and it's also

808
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,679
it's

809
00:29:25,399 --> 00:29:30,320
also see what happens as the story

810
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:32,640
progresses is that Abraham Abraham and

811
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,919
Sarah are eventually granted a son but

812
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,480
it's way late in the story and they're

813
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:37,600
very very old by the time it happens and

814
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:40,000
of course you're not going to be a

815
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:43,279
father of Nations without having a child

816
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:45,519
and so the the writers are attempting to

817
00:29:43,279 --> 00:29:49,039
to make the case that if you

818
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:51,799
forthrightly pursue that which God

819
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:53,880
directs you to pursue let's say that all

820
00:29:51,799 --> 00:29:55,799
things are possible that's that's the

821
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:59,360
idea in the narrative and you know you

822
00:29:55,799 --> 00:30:01,799
you might say that's naive and you know

823
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:04,440
it it's not it you think it when you're

824
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:07,279
naive right and then you dispense with

825
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:09,000
that idea and then when you stop being

826
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:11,440
the sort of person who dispenses with

827
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:13,039
ideas then you come to another place and

828
00:30:11,440 --> 00:30:15,440
that's the place where you

829
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:17,240
think you have no idea what might be

830
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:18,519
possible for you if you if you got

831
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:21,320
things together and pursued what you

832
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:23,399
should pursue you don't know how much

833
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:25,720
what's impossible to you right now would

834
00:30:23,399 --> 00:30:29,000
become possible under those conditions

835
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:30,679
it's an unknown phenomena and like I've

836
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,279
watched people who put themselves

837
00:30:30,679 --> 00:30:34,399
together across time you know

838
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:36,840
incrementally and continually and they

839
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:39,200
become capable of things that are jaw

840
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:41,760
not only jaw-droppingly amazingly but

841
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:44,080
also sometimes metaphysically impossible

842
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:47,600
to understand and so we don't know the

843
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:50,679
limits of human endeavor we truly don't

844
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:52,840
and it it's it's premature to put a cap

845
00:30:50,679 --> 00:30:54,960
on what it is that we are what that what

846
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:56,399
it is that we're capable of and so you

847
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:58,120
you know you're already something and

848
00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:00,000
maybe you're not so bad in your current

849
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:02,679
configuration but you might wonder if

850
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:04,399
you did nothing for the next 30 Years

851
00:31:02,679 --> 00:31:07,360
except put yourself together just

852
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:08,440
exactly what would you be able to do and

853
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:10,240
you might think well that's worth

854
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:12,000
finding out but of course that's that's

855
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,840
the adoption of responsibility and one

856
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:15,840
thing I've also learned over the years

857
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:17,919
because I've been curious about this

858
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,960
battle between meaning and nihilism you

859
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:22,880
know and I mean I mean I could see for a

860
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:25,279
long while the rationale in nihilism and

861
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:27,880
and the power of the nihilistic argument

862
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:30,960
but it it it occurred to me across

863
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:32,600
across time that despite that the power

864
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:34,919
of the nihilistic argument is more

865
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:38,120
powerful than naive optimism but it's

866
00:31:34,919 --> 00:31:41,519
not more powerful than the optimism that

867
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:44,279
is not naive because the optimism that

868
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:46,279
is not naive says it's self-evident that

869
00:31:44,279 --> 00:31:48,039
the world is a place of suffering and

870
00:31:46,279 --> 00:31:50,600
that there are things to be done about

871
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:52,240
that and it's self-evident that people

872
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:55,600
are flawed and that there's things to be

873
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:58,440
done about that and then The non-naive

874
00:31:55,600 --> 00:32:01,320
Optimist says the suffering could be

875
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:03,880
reduced and the insufficiency could be

876
00:32:01,320 --> 00:32:06,080
overcome if people oriented themselves

877
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:07,919
properly and did what they were capable

878
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:11,240
of doing and I do not believe that

879
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:14,240
that's deniable I I do I do I think that

880
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:15,799
human potential is virtually Limitless

881
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,720
and that there's nothing perhaps that's

882
00:32:15,799 --> 00:32:19,960
beyond our grasp if we're careful as

883
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:21,320
individuals and as a society and so I

884
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:23,440
think that there's no reason for

885
00:32:21,320 --> 00:32:25,679
nihilism and there's no reason for

886
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:28,360
hopelessness and and there's no reason

887
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:31,039
to bow down before evil because we're

888
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:33,039
capable of so much more and I think that

889
00:32:31,039 --> 00:32:34,880
you can easily you know that first

890
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:36,480
because you're not happy with who you

891
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:38,440
are and you're ashamed and embarrassed

892
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,080
about it as you should be and you know

893
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:41,799
it because if you look out there you see

894
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:43,600
people who are capable of doing great

895
00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:45,720
things and you know that we're not

896
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:47,960
giving at our all and still we're not

897
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:51,480
doing so badly you know and so you you

898
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:53,240
might wonder if if if we devoted 90% of

899
00:32:51,480 --> 00:32:56,039
our effort to putting things right

900
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:58,039
instead of 55% of our effort or maybe

901
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:59,720
even less than that you might wonder

902
00:32:58,039 --> 00:33:01,960
just how well could things be put

903
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:03,919
together and I think that you can figure

904
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:06,039
that out by starting with your room by

905
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:09,080
the

906
00:33:06,039 --> 00:33:10,960
way and the Lord said unto Abram and

907
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:14,240
this is this is the this is the opening

908
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:16,399
of the story get thee out of thy country

909
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:18,679
and from thy Kindred and from thy

910
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:21,000
Father's House unto a land that I will

911
00:33:18,679 --> 00:33:24,200
show thee and this is one of those

912
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:26,600
phrases where every Clause is

913
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:28,960
significant go somewhere you don't

914
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:31,200
understand that's the first thing get

915
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:33,320
thee out of thy country you know back in

916
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:35,480
the 1920s there was a whole slew of

917
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:38,360
American Writers who ended up as exp

918
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:40,960
Patriots in Paris Hemingway among them

919
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:43,679
and and who wrote The Great

920
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:45,320
Gatsby Fitzgerald yes and then a variety

921
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:47,880
of others it was very inexpensive in

922
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:49,480
Paris at the time and part of their

923
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,799
transformation into great literary

924
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:52,559
figures was the fact that they were out

925
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:54,039
of their country and now they could see

926
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:55,600
what their country was because you can't

927
00:33:54,039 --> 00:33:57,880
see what your country is until you leave

928
00:33:55,600 --> 00:34:00,240
it so you have to go into the unknown

929
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:02,519
and that's that's God's First Command go

930
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:04,960
into the unknown because you already

931
00:34:02,519 --> 00:34:07,039
know what you know and so and that's not

932
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:08,399
enough unless you think you're enough

933
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:09,720
and if you're not enough and you don't

934
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:11,720
think you're enough then you have to go

935
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:14,280
where you haven't been and so that's the

936
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:15,960
first commandment to Abraham it's like

937
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:18,359
okay that that's a good one that makes

938
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:20,760
perfect sense go to where you don't know

939
00:34:18,359 --> 00:34:24,040
yes and from th Kindred well that what

940
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:25,839
does that mean it means grow up right

941
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:27,760
that's what it means it means get away

942
00:34:25,839 --> 00:34:29,560
from your family enough so that you can

943
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,720
establish your Independence and that

944
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:32,320
isn't because there's something wrong

945
00:34:30,720 --> 00:34:34,800
with your family although perhaps there

946
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:38,359
is you know as there is perhaps wrong

947
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:40,359
with you but it means get away you know

948
00:34:38,359 --> 00:34:42,359
I talk to people very frequently whose

949
00:34:40,359 --> 00:34:44,480
families have provided them with too

950
00:34:42,359 --> 00:34:45,839
much protection and they know it

951
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:48,399
themselves and that means they're

952
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:49,839
deprived of necessity you know one of

953
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:53,560
the things that you see in in in the

954
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:55,200
United States for example is that um the

955
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:56,800
children of first generation immigrants

956
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:58,680
often do better than the CH than the

957
00:34:56,800 --> 00:35:00,119
than their children and the reason for

958
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:02,400
that is that the children of first

959
00:35:00,119 --> 00:35:04,320
generation IM immigrants have necessity

960
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,440
driving them and you don't know how much

961
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:08,800
you need necessity to drive you because

962
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:11,240
maybe you're not very disciplined and if

963
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:13,839
a catastrophe doesn't immediately befall

964
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:15,680
you if you don't act forthrightly today

965
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:18,160
then maybe you never act forthrightly

966
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:20,359
right because the the the gap between

967
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:23,000
your foolishness and the punishment is

968
00:35:20,359 --> 00:35:24,599
is lengthened by your unearned wealth

969
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:26,720
and so you never grow up and learn and

970
00:35:24,599 --> 00:35:30,160
you have to get yourself away from your

971
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:32,880
dependency in order to allow necessity

972
00:35:30,160 --> 00:35:35,280
to drive you forward and that's to

973
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,839
become independent and to become mature

974
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:40,599
and I think part of what's happening in

975
00:35:36,839 --> 00:35:43,680
our culture is that the the the force

976
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:46,040
that's attacking the the forthright

977
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:48,960
movement forward of young men in

978
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:51,119
particular is afraid of the power of men

979
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:53,520
because it's confused about the

980
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:55,440
distinction between power and authority

981
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:58,720
and competence

982
00:35:55,440 --> 00:36:01,680
like a man who's who has Authority and

983
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:03,000
competence has power as a byproduct but

984
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:05,920
the authority and competence is

985
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,880
everything and and and people who can't

986
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,760
understand

987
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:11,319
that fail to make the distinction

988
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:13,079
between power and authority of

989
00:36:11,319 --> 00:36:14,680
competence and they're afraid of power

990
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:16,640
and so they destroy Authority and

991
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:18,280
competence and that's a terrible thing

992
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:20,400
because we need Authority and competence

993
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:23,480
what else is going to what else is going

994
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:25,280
to allow us to Prevail in the long run

995
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:27,280
and so you get away from your country

996
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:29,680
and you get away from your kin and from

997
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:31,359
your father's house right and you go out

998
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:33,160
there and you establish yourself in the

999
00:36:31,359 --> 00:36:35,599
world it's a call to Adventure that's

1000
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:38,440
what this the the first lines in the

1001
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:42,119
abrahamic story is a call to Adventure

1002
00:36:38,440 --> 00:36:46,000
so great unto a land that I will show

1003
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:46,000
you well you know what does that

1004
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:53,400
mean you know what one of the things

1005
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:55,359
that I've been struck very hard by a

1006
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:58,240
number of writers Carl Jung obviously

1007
00:36:55,359 --> 00:37:00,520
among them I mean he he wrote things

1008
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:03,079
like nature that if you understand them

1009
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:04,880
they just break you into pieces you know

1010
00:37:03,079 --> 00:37:06,560
and and one of the things that Yung

1011
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,400
understood in the psychoanalysts

1012
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,599
understand it's one of the most

1013
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:11,520
terrifying elements of psychoanalytic

1014
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:13,599
thinking it's very tightly allied with

1015
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:16,240
religious thinking which is that you are

1016
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:19,319
not the master of your own house there

1017
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:21,720
are spirits that dwell in you within you

1018
00:37:19,319 --> 00:37:24,520
meaning you have a will and you can

1019
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:26,119
exercise a certain amount of conscious

1020
00:37:24,520 --> 00:37:28,160
control over your being but there are

1021
00:37:26,119 --> 00:37:29,960
all sorts of things that occur within

1022
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:32,480
that seem to be Beyond Your Capacity to

1023
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:34,240
control your dreams for example that's a

1024
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:35,760
really good example or your impulses for

1025
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,160
example you you might think of those as

1026
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:38,839
so foreign from you that they're not

1027
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:41,680
even you don't even want them to be part

1028
00:37:38,839 --> 00:37:43,319
of you but but more subtly even how

1029
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:45,640
about what you're interested in what

1030
00:37:43,319 --> 00:37:49,839
compels you like where does that come

1031
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:51,640
from exactly because you can't you can't

1032
00:37:49,839 --> 00:37:53,560
conjure it up of your own accord you

1033
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:55,560
know so if you're a student and you're

1034
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:57,520
taking difficult course you might say to

1035
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:59,599
yourself well I need to sit down and

1036
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:01,200
study for 3 hours but then you sit down

1037
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:03,079
and that isn't what happens your

1038
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:05,640
attention goes everywhere and you might

1039
00:38:03,079 --> 00:38:07,560
say well whose attention is it then if

1040
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:09,760
it goes everywhere because you say it's

1041
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:11,040
your attention it's like well if it's

1042
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,520
your attention maybe you would be able

1043
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:15,440
to control it but you can't and so then

1044
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:17,680
you might think well J just exactly what

1045
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:19,480
the hell is controlling it and you might

1046
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:21,839
say well it's random it's well it better

1047
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:23,319
not be random I can tell you that that's

1048
00:38:21,839 --> 00:38:24,760
that happens to some degree in

1049
00:38:23,319 --> 00:38:28,079
schizophrenia there's an element of

1050
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:31,040
Randomness in that it's not random it's

1051
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:32,839
driven by the action of of phenomena

1052
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,920
that I think are best considered as

1053
00:38:32,839 --> 00:38:37,960
something like subpersonalities although

1054
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:40,119
even that's only a partial

1055
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:41,760
description you can't make yourself

1056
00:38:40,119 --> 00:38:45,079
interested in

1057
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:48,280
something interest manifests itself and

1058
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:50,520
grips you that's a whole different

1059
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:52,480
thing and so what is it that's gripping

1060
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:54,520
you and and how do you conceptualize

1061
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,880
that is that a divine power well it's

1062
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:57,800
divine as far as you're concerned

1063
00:38:55,880 --> 00:39:00,480
because it grips you and you can't do

1064
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:02,079
anything about it and so there's a

1065
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:03,480
calling in you towards what you're

1066
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:05,960
compelled by and what you're interested

1067
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:08,280
in and sometimes that might be very dark

1068
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:11,960
and sometimes not but you're compelled

1069
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:15,400
forward by your interest and

1070
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:17,040
so and so the idea that what moves you

1071
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:18,760
away from your country and your father's

1072
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:21,000
house and the Comforts of your childhood

1073
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:23,280
home is is something that's beyond you

1074
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:25,200
and that you listen to and hearken to

1075
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:26,800
that's exactly right and you can say

1076
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:29,920
well I don't want to call that God it's

1077
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:33,440
like it doesn't matter what you call it

1078
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:37,119
exactly it doesn't matter to what it is

1079
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:38,680
what it's called it's still is and if

1080
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:40,400
you don't listen to it that's the other

1081
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:41,960
thing if you don't listen to it and I've

1082
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:44,680
been a clinician and talked to enough

1083
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:46,800
people now as old as I am to know this

1084
00:39:44,680 --> 00:39:48,839
absolutely if you do not listen to that

1085
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,839
thing that beckons you forward you will

1086
00:39:48,839 --> 00:39:53,000
pay for it like you cannot possibly

1087
00:39:50,839 --> 00:39:55,520
imagine you'll have everything that's

1088
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,839
terrible about life in your life and

1089
00:39:55,520 --> 00:40:00,079
nothing about it that's good and worse

1090
00:39:57,839 --> 00:40:02,960
you'll know that it was your fault and

1091
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:04,599
that you squandered what you could have

1092
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:07,760
had

1093
00:40:04,599 --> 00:40:10,599
so this is not only a calling forth but

1094
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:12,680
a warning unto a land that I will show

1095
00:40:10,599 --> 00:40:14,680
thee and and that's it that I will show

1096
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:17,520
thee that and you don't want to be too

1097
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:19,200
concrete about this you know there's all

1098
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:21,560
sorts of new territories that you can

1099
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:23,119
inhabit if you there's there's abstract

1100
00:40:21,560 --> 00:40:24,760
and conceptual territories if you go to

1101
00:40:23,119 --> 00:40:26,839
university and you study biology or you

1102
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:28,760
study Physics or or any discipline

1103
00:40:26,839 --> 00:40:30,359
you're in territory right you're in the

1104
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:32,240
territory that all the scholars have

1105
00:40:30,359 --> 00:40:33,960
established and then as you master the

1106
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:35,800
discipline you move out beyond the

1107
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:38,119
established territory into the unknown

1108
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:40,119
and and that's a new land right maybe

1109
00:40:38,119 --> 00:40:42,000
it's even a land of your enemies for

1110
00:40:40,119 --> 00:40:44,319
that matter but it's a new land the

1111
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:46,160
frontier is always in front of you and

1112
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:48,359
so you know when the Earth was less

1113
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:50,520
inhabited than it is now the frontier

1114
00:40:48,359 --> 00:40:52,400
was the psychological Frontier and the

1115
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:54,079
geographical Frontier was the same thing

1116
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,839
and now they've separated to some degree

1117
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:58,040
because there's not so much geographical

1118
00:40:55,839 --> 00:41:00,760
Frontier but there's the Frontier is a

1119
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:02,640
place that never disappears and the land

1120
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:04,240
that's beyond the land that you know is

1121
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:06,480
always there and it's always where you

1122
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:10,240
should go and all of that's packed into

1123
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:13,359
these what four phrases

1124
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:15,400
so well so when I've been thinking about

1125
00:41:13,359 --> 00:41:17,839
narrative you look at the world through

1126
00:41:15,400 --> 00:41:19,640
a story you can't you can't help it and

1127
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:21,960
this the story is what gives value to

1128
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:23,680
the world or or the story is what you

1129
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:25,760
extract from the value of the world you

1130
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:27,839
can look at it either way you're

1131
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:29,720
somewhere and it's not good enough right

1132
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:31,319
that's the Eternal human predicament

1133
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:32,760
wherever you are isn't good enough and

1134
00:41:31,319 --> 00:41:34,839
to some degree that's actually a good

1135
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:37,079
thing because if it was good enough well

1136
00:41:34,839 --> 00:41:38,800
there's nothing for you to do so it's

1137
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:41,119
actually maybe a good thing that it's

1138
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:43,599
insufficient and that might be why

1139
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:45,920
sometimes having less is is better than

1140
00:41:43,599 --> 00:41:47,760
having more and and I don't want to be a

1141
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,960
poana about that I mean I know that

1142
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:51,640
there's deprivation that can reach to

1143
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:53,760
the point where it's no where it's

1144
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:56,440
completely counterproductive but it

1145
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:58,160
isn't always the case that starting with

1146
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:59,760
little is

1147
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:01,520
you if you start with little you start

1148
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:04,280
with more possibility it's something

1149
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:05,839
like that so you move from always from

1150
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:08,040
what's unbearable about the present to

1151
00:42:05,839 --> 00:42:10,319
some better future right and if you

1152
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:12,480
don't have that then you have no you

1153
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:14,040
have nothing but threat and and negative

1154
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:15,800
emotion you have no positive emotion

1155
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:17,720
because the positive emotion is

1156
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:20,480
generated in the conception of the

1157
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:21,920
better future and then the evidence that

1158
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:23,880
you generate yourself that you're moving

1159
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:25,480
towards it that's where the positive and

1160
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:27,520
fulfilling meaning of life comes so you

1161
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:29,040
want to set up this structure properly

1162
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:32,119
it's very very important and so what it

1163
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:34,400
means is that you want to be going

1164
00:42:32,119 --> 00:42:36,880
somewhere that's good enough so that the

1165
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,800
going is worth the while and you can ask

1166
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:40,319
yourself that and that's partly what we

1167
00:42:38,800 --> 00:42:42,640
tried to build into the future authoring

1168
00:42:40,319 --> 00:42:44,839
program which is well we know what's

1169
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:47,040
wrong with life it's rif with suffering

1170
00:42:44,839 --> 00:42:49,559
and insufficiency and deception and evil

1171
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:51,440
it's all of that obviously okay what

1172
00:42:49,559 --> 00:42:53,760
would make the journey

1173
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:55,520
worthwhile well you can ask yourself

1174
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:58,000
that it's like all right in order to

1175
00:42:55,520 --> 00:43:00,359
Bear up under this load what is it that

1176
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,240
I would need to be striving to attain

1177
00:43:00,359 --> 00:43:04,640
and if you ask yourself that that's to

1178
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:06,839
knock and and the door will open that's

1179
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:08,520
what that means if you ask yourself that

1180
00:43:06,839 --> 00:43:10,079
then you will find an answer and you'll

1181
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:11,760
think you'll shrink away from it you'll

1182
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:14,200
think well there's no way I could do

1183
00:43:11,760 --> 00:43:16,400
that it's like well you don't know what

1184
00:43:14,200 --> 00:43:18,839
you could do you don't know what's

1185
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:21,800
possible and you're not as much as you

1186
00:43:18,839 --> 00:43:24,040
could be and so God only knows what you

1187
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:27,319
could what you could do and have and

1188
00:43:24,040 --> 00:43:30,680
give if you sacrificed everything to it

1189
00:43:27,319 --> 00:43:32,680
it and that's the reason Abraham is

1190
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:35,200
constantly making sacrifices and it's

1191
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:37,800
archaic right he's burning up like baby

1192
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:39,400
lambs but like well they're alive you

1193
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:41,200
know that's something and and they're

1194
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:43,520
valuable and that's something it's you

1195
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:45,599
have to admit even if you think about it

1196
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:47,839
as a modern person that the act of

1197
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:50,359
sacrificing something might have some

1198
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:52,119
dramatic compulsion to it you know to go

1199
00:43:50,359 --> 00:43:54,200
out into a flock and to take something

1200
00:43:52,119 --> 00:43:56,720
that's newborn and to cut its throat and

1201
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:58,240
to bleed it and to burn it might be a

1202
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:00,599
way of indicating to yourself that

1203
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:02,280
you're actually serious about something

1204
00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:04,680
and it isn't so obvious that we have

1205
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:05,920
rituals of seriousness like that now and

1206
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:08,000
so it's not so obvious that we're

1207
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:09,680
actually serious about anything and so

1208
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,079
maybe that's not such a good thing and

1209
00:44:09,680 --> 00:44:12,640
so maybe we shouldn't be thinking that

1210
00:44:11,079 --> 00:44:14,559
these people were so archaic and

1211
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:15,839
primitive and superstitious it's

1212
00:44:14,559 --> 00:44:18,960
possible that they knew something that

1213
00:44:15,839 --> 00:44:21,079
we don't and certainly in the abrahamic

1214
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:22,760
stories one of the things that maintains

1215
00:44:21,079 --> 00:44:25,079
Abraham's Covenant with God is his

1216
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:26,680
continual willingness to sacrifice it's

1217
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:29,200
so that sacrificial issue is so

1218
00:44:26,680 --> 00:44:30,680
important because you are not committed

1219
00:44:29,200 --> 00:44:32,680
to something unless you're willing to

1220
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:35,520
sacrifice for it commitment and

1221
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:38,200
sacrifice are the same thing and I think

1222
00:44:35,520 --> 00:44:40,040
it's it borders on miraculous that those

1223
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:42,160
concepts are embedded into this

1224
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:43,960
narrative at the level of dramatic

1225
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:46,480
action you know instead of abstract

1226
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:48,119
explanation people are acting this out

1227
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:50,040
and then the the fundamental conception

1228
00:44:48,119 --> 00:44:52,640
is so profound that it's really quite

1229
00:44:50,040 --> 00:44:55,280
it's quite a inspiring it's it's

1230
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:58,200
breathtaking really when you understand

1231
00:44:55,280 --> 00:45:00,160
what message is trying to be invade you

1232
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:03,079
have to make sacrifices what do you have

1233
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:05,760
to sacrifice you have to sacrifice that

1234
00:45:03,079 --> 00:45:08,720
which is most valuable to you currently

1235
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:10,640
that's stopping you and God only knows

1236
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:13,119
what that is it's certainly the worst of

1237
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:15,079
you it's certainly that and God Only

1238
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:18,400
Knows to what degree you're in love with

1239
00:45:15,079 --> 00:45:21,119
the worst of you

1240
00:45:18,400 --> 00:45:24,079
so well so you move from the unbearable

1241
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:25,680
present to the ideal future and and you

1242
00:45:24,079 --> 00:45:27,240
can't help that you have to live in a

1243
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:28,559
structure like that that's your house

1244
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:30,000
that's another way of thinking about it

1245
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:31,880
then if you want to get your house in

1246
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:34,920
order and if you want it to be a place

1247
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:39,839
that you can live properly then you have

1248
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:42,760
to plan the future that is

1249
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:46,319
perfect and then I think well what does

1250
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:48,760
that mean and it means it's good for you

1251
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:50,440
right and one of the things that I I'm I

1252
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:52,640
do all the time with my clinical and

1253
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:54,920
Consulting clients is try to figure out

1254
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:56,440
what would be good for them but we we do

1255
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:57,960
more than that we try to think okay well

1256
00:45:56,440 --> 00:46:00,480
what how can we set this up so it's

1257
00:45:57,960 --> 00:46:02,240
really good for you and that all the

1258
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:04,760
side consequences of that are things

1259
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:06,440
that are good for other people and so

1260
00:46:04,760 --> 00:46:07,760
because people are often also timid

1261
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:09,040
about trying to get something that's

1262
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:10,400
good for themselves because they feel

1263
00:46:09,040 --> 00:46:12,720
that it's selfish or that they don't

1264
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:14,319
deserve it so we set it up so that well

1265
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:17,440
look we're going to set it up so that

1266
00:46:14,319 --> 00:46:19,640
it's plainly obvious that this will not

1267
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:22,079
harm the structure of the universe for

1268
00:46:19,640 --> 00:46:23,680
you to have what you need and to do it

1269
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:27,119
in a way that's of benefit to other

1270
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:29,079
people there's no downside to that and

1271
00:46:27,119 --> 00:46:30,760
and so it's okay it's okay if you reach

1272
00:46:29,079 --> 00:46:32,720
out and take that and one of the things

1273
00:46:30,760 --> 00:46:34,480
that's interesting about the biblical

1274
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:36,319
Stories the abrahamic stories as well is

1275
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:38,359
that God doesn't really seem to be

1276
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:40,839
opposed to the success of the people

1277
00:46:38,359 --> 00:46:42,599
that he's chosen you know what happens

1278
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:44,960
to them is as they progress through

1279
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:47,559
their journey is they they get larger

1280
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:49,480
flocks and they they get more Authority

1281
00:46:47,559 --> 00:46:51,720
and they they get they get more they get

1282
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:53,559
life more abundant that's what happens

1283
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:55,680
it's God isn't doesn't seem to be a

1284
00:46:53,559 --> 00:46:58,640
miser in the Old Testament it's like if

1285
00:46:55,680 --> 00:47:00,599
you put in the and you and you accept

1286
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:02,880
the Covenant and you make the sacrifices

1287
00:47:00,599 --> 00:47:05,240
then you get to be successful and maybe

1288
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:07,280
successful beyond your wildest dreams

1289
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:09,280
and that that's actually seems to be

1290
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:11,359
okay with God and that's pretty cool

1291
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:13,800
given that you know that that General

1292
00:47:11,359 --> 00:47:16,240
notion of Old Testament God is that all

1293
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:17,839
he's doing is casting out curses and

1294
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:19,800
death you know wherever he happens to

1295
00:47:17,839 --> 00:47:23,119
wander and I mean there's certainly no

1296
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:24,559
shortage of that but but again it seems

1297
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:26,040
to me that that's very good news and

1298
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:28,839
that you also don't have to be perfect

1299
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:30,760
in order for have that happen and then

1300
00:47:28,839 --> 00:47:33,200
the other thing this is the issue about

1301
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:35,520
going into the unknown it's like well if

1302
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:37,839
you leave your country and your kin and

1303
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:40,599
your father's house and you go out into

1304
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:43,040
a land that your intuition guides you to

1305
00:47:40,599 --> 00:47:44,880
you're going to undergo these radical

1306
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:46,480
Transformations this is a sacrificial

1307
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:49,119
transformation too because you're you're

1308
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:51,280
moving forthrightly and voluntarily into

1309
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:53,520
chaos right and that's the same as the

1310
00:47:51,280 --> 00:47:55,640
dragon fight that's the hero's story and

1311
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:58,520
what will happen there is that you will

1312
00:47:55,640 --> 00:48:01,240
transform yourself and so the call to an

1313
00:47:58,520 --> 00:48:03,839
ideal is also the call to a sequence of

1314
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:06,839
deaths and rebirths that move you closer

1315
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:09,640
and closer to the ideal and that's what

1316
00:48:06,839 --> 00:48:15,079
that's what God is calling Abraham to

1317
00:48:09,640 --> 00:48:15,079
do in the first sentence of this

1318
00:48:20,599 --> 00:48:26,599
story you see these things

1319
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:28,000
echoed in the strangest places and so

1320
00:48:26,599 --> 00:48:30,480
the SE are Stills that I took from

1321
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:32,440
Pinocchio and this little Cricket so he

1322
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:34,280
the still Small Voice right that's the

1323
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:36,200
thing that calls to you it's your

1324
00:48:34,280 --> 00:48:38,119
conscious conscience in part it's your

1325
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:39,760
intuition in part and it's the thing

1326
00:48:38,119 --> 00:48:41,720
that opens up the Great Book of the

1327
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:43,680
world the great Sacred Book of the world

1328
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:45,720
and that's what happens here right and

1329
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:48,359
the animators are at pains to show you

1330
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:50,960
that it's a leatherbound book with guilt

1331
00:48:48,359 --> 00:48:52,720
lettering it's a valuable book and it's

1332
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:54,480
something that's quiet that's showing it

1333
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:56,200
to you right you have to meditate let's

1334
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:58,880
say you have to be somewhere where the

1335
00:48:56,200 --> 00:49:00,680
world is drowning you out in order to

1336
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:03,079
understand how to open this to listen to

1337
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:05,920
that voice that tells you where you

1338
00:49:03,079 --> 00:49:08,119
should go what what you should do

1339
00:49:05,920 --> 00:49:10,520
next and then what happens is that

1340
00:49:08,119 --> 00:49:12,520
something beckons to you in the night

1341
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:14,920
it's a star right it's something that

1342
00:49:12,520 --> 00:49:17,280
transcends the Horizon it's it's

1343
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:19,319
Glitters it's it's brilliant it's it's

1344
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:21,280
not day-to-day it's something that's

1345
00:49:19,319 --> 00:49:24,400
beyond you it's something that

1346
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:27,040
represents a Transcendent ideal and that

1347
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:28,880
makes it manifest to you if you're quiet

1348
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:31,720
enough to listen and that's what you

1349
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:33,440
wish upon so strangely right and people

1350
00:49:31,720 --> 00:49:35,160
do that they wish upon a star they teach

1351
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:37,480
their children that and they don't know

1352
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:38,799
why why what do you mean you wish upon a

1353
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:40,680
star what what in the world does that

1354
00:49:38,799 --> 00:49:42,440
mean it means you lift your eyes to the

1355
00:49:40,680 --> 00:49:44,880
heavens and make a pact with the

1356
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:46,839
transcendant and then your and then what

1357
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:48,920
your heart's desire will come to you

1358
00:49:46,839 --> 00:49:51,640
that's what it means and you think well

1359
00:49:48,920 --> 00:49:54,839
that's so that's not naive it's the most

1360
00:49:51,640 --> 00:49:57,160
sophisticated thing that you can

1361
00:49:54,839 --> 00:49:59,000
know and it's the birth of the hero

1362
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:02,400
right because that's the that's the

1363
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:02,400
Nativity star

1364
00:50:03,960 --> 00:50:09,079
obviously and this is where it takes

1365
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:11,400
place it's just anywhere and the person

1366
00:50:09,079 --> 00:50:13,640
in it is just a carpenter and a toy

1367
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:15,200
maker but that's pretty good a carpenter

1368
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:17,119
if you're a deceitful Carpenter then

1369
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:18,920
your house falls down and if you're a

1370
00:50:17,119 --> 00:50:20,920
toy maker then you love children it's

1371
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:22,680
that's a good start you know so so

1372
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:25,280
jepetto who lives in this little it's

1373
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:28,079
it's it's a it's not a grand house it's

1374
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:29,520
it's it's just everyday house but

1375
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:31,720
everything that's happening in it is

1376
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:33,640
good and so that means it's it's a

1377
00:50:31,720 --> 00:50:35,160
palace because everything in it is H

1378
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:36,599
that's happening is good there's a

1379
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:38,760
saying and I I don't remember where it

1380
00:50:36,599 --> 00:50:40,799
comes from that it's better to have

1381
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:42,920
bread and water in peace than a feast in

1382
00:50:40,799 --> 00:50:45,079
conflict and like that's not a saying

1383
00:50:42,920 --> 00:50:47,040
that's just the starkest possible

1384
00:50:45,079 --> 00:50:49,680
description of the truth because there's

1385
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:51,760
nothing worse than eating a grand meal

1386
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:53,839
with people you hate and despise that

1387
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:55,720
are at each other's throats it's much

1388
00:50:53,839 --> 00:50:58,520
better to have bread and water in peace

1389
00:50:55,720 --> 00:51:00,680
it's it's it's it's not it's it's just

1390
00:50:58,520 --> 00:51:03,440
clearheaded analysis of the structure of

1391
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:05,440
the world to say things like that and so

1392
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:08,040
the magical transformation can happen in

1393
00:51:05,440 --> 00:51:10,960
the most mundane of places because and

1394
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:13,359
the reason for that is that the mundane

1395
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:17,000
nature of places is an illusion because

1396
00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:21,200
every place is the potential birthplace

1397
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:25,119
of the kingdom of God that's the

1398
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:26,920
case and so japeto he's a good guy he

1399
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:29,880
has a kitten you know the kitten likes

1400
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:32,200
them he makes puppets and he's humble

1401
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:34,640
person and he knows that compared to the

1402
00:51:32,200 --> 00:51:38,599
ideal that he's attempting to subscribe

1403
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:40,119
to that he's he's not a based before it

1404
00:51:38,599 --> 00:51:42,960
or anything like that he's not

1405
00:51:40,119 --> 00:51:44,720
despicable in relationship to it but the

1406
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:47,680
reason he's on his knees is because the

1407
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:51,480
thing he's pointing at is above him you

1408
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:53,240
know if it wouldn't be the right aim if

1409
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:55,640
it wasn't above him and so the fact that

1410
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:57,760
he's on his knees so to speak is only an

1411
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:59,839
indication that his is proper because

1412
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:02,240
you should be on your knees to something

1413
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:03,640
that you actually admire and if you

1414
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:05,000
don't feel like being on your knees in

1415
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:06,599
front of it then perhaps you don't

1416
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,839
actually admire it and then that means

1417
00:52:06,599 --> 00:52:10,599
you haven't got the stage set properly

1418
00:52:08,839 --> 00:52:12,640
it could be it should be something that

1419
00:52:10,599 --> 00:52:14,400
fills you with awe your aim should

1420
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:17,240
should be at something that fills you

1421
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:19,720
with awe because what why why do

1422
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:21,640
something else well perhaps because it's

1423
00:52:19,720 --> 00:52:23,680
easy and perhaps because it's malevolent

1424
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:25,720
and all of those things but but those

1425
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:27,319
are no answer to the problems that beset

1426
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:28,640
you they just make things worse and

1427
00:52:27,319 --> 00:52:32,319
that's

1428
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:35,240
clear and so then jedo have having made

1429
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:37,079
his pact his Covenant just like Abraham

1430
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:38,960
he falls into a dream right he falls

1431
00:52:37,079 --> 00:52:41,040
into a dream and the rest of the movie

1432
00:52:38,960 --> 00:52:43,160
actually takes place in a dream and it's

1433
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:45,400
a Dream It's The Dream Within which

1434
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:47,799
transformation takes place and that's

1435
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:49,920
laid out at least in part time stops in

1436
00:52:47,799 --> 00:52:51,960
in in the Pinocchio story and everything

1437
00:52:49,920 --> 00:52:54,079
happens to Pinocchio in some sense in a

1438
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:56,040
land that's outside of normal time and

1439
00:52:54,079 --> 00:52:58,200
that's that's the infinite archetypal

1440
00:52:56,040 --> 00:53:00,119
space that's a real place that's a real

1441
00:52:58,200 --> 00:53:02,440
place the infinite and the finite

1442
00:53:00,119 --> 00:53:04,160
coexist and most of the time we're in

1443
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:05,799
the place of the finite but that doesn't

1444
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:07,280
mean that the place of the infinite

1445
00:53:05,799 --> 00:53:08,920
doesn't exist it just means that we

1446
00:53:07,280 --> 00:53:11,559
can't get access to it we just get

1447
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:12,960
intimations of it from time to time you

1448
00:53:11,559 --> 00:53:15,200
know when things are going perfectly

1449
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:17,200
well for you on those rare occasions

1450
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:19,839
where everything comes together for the

1451
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:21,920
brief moment you inhabit that Divine

1452
00:53:19,839 --> 00:53:24,640
place and you have some sense of what

1453
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:26,640
your life could be like if you organized

1454
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:28,559
it from the smallest element to the

1455
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:30,920
largest element and that's a place that

1456
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:34,480
you can inhabit if not forever in a

1457
00:53:30,920 --> 00:53:34,480
manner that at least felt like

1458
00:53:41,640 --> 00:53:46,839
forever well because of jepetto's

1459
00:53:44,520 --> 00:53:48,839
decision the Transcendent manifests

1460
00:53:46,839 --> 00:53:50,480
itself it takes the form of the Blue

1461
00:53:48,839 --> 00:53:53,400
Fairy here that's the positive element

1462
00:53:50,480 --> 00:53:56,520
of nature right so we could say well

1463
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:58,839
nature it's not so clear that she's or

1464
00:53:56,520 --> 00:54:00,559
your side right she's the Red Queen in

1465
00:53:58,839 --> 00:54:02,359
Ellison Wonderland who runs around

1466
00:54:00,559 --> 00:54:05,240
screaming when you go down the rabbit

1467
00:54:02,359 --> 00:54:08,240
hole she runs around screaming off with

1468
00:54:05,240 --> 00:54:09,920
their heads and who says In My Kingdom

1469
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:12,520
you have to run as fast as you can just

1470
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:15,000
to stay in the same place that's mother

1471
00:54:12,520 --> 00:54:16,559
nature but then we might say well how do

1472
00:54:15,000 --> 00:54:18,720
we know that Mother Nature's attitude

1473
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:21,520
towards you isn't negative because your

1474
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:23,240
attitude towards things isn't proper and

1475
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:25,680
that's what this film attempts to

1476
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:28,319
indicate the idea is that if you aim

1477
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:31,839
properly then nature aligns itself

1478
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:33,400
behind you now it also arrays itself in

1479
00:54:31,839 --> 00:54:37,200
front of you perhaps even as an

1480
00:54:33,400 --> 00:54:39,960
antagonist but the power that it it it

1481
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:43,200
provides you with from within might be

1482
00:54:39,960 --> 00:54:45,319
sufficient to overcome it from without

1483
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:47,680
and I think that I think that the

1484
00:54:45,319 --> 00:54:48,960
clinical evidence is clear about that

1485
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:51,480
because one of the things that we do

1486
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:53,400
know is that if you take people who are

1487
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:56,799
confronting terrible things and

1488
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:59,520
shrinking from them and you teach them

1489
00:54:56,799 --> 00:55:02,880
how to structure their behavior so that

1490
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:06,920
they can advance with

1491
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:09,400
courage everything works better for them

1492
00:55:06,920 --> 00:55:12,440
their fears decrease and their character

1493
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:14,599
grows and so there might be enough of

1494
00:55:12,440 --> 00:55:17,200
nature within us to help us withstand

1495
00:55:14,599 --> 00:55:18,920
the nature that's outside of us and it

1496
00:55:17,200 --> 00:55:20,559
depends at least to some degree on how

1497
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:23,559
it is that we Orient ourselves in the

1498
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:26,559
world to some in to some unknowable

1499
00:55:23,559 --> 00:55:26,559
degree

1500
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:33,079
now jepetto wants an autonomous

1501
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:35,440
individual as a

1502
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:39,000
son and that's also something that makes

1503
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:41,520
him a great person because autonomous

1504
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:43,079
individuals have their own will and if

1505
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:44,880
you're a tyrant it's the last thing that

1506
00:55:43,079 --> 00:55:47,440
you're going to want and if you're the

1507
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:49,280
Tyrant who's jealous of his son it's

1508
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:52,319
even more so the last thing you're ever

1509
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:54,160
going to want and so to aim high and to

1510
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:55,599
want the development of the autonomous

1511
00:55:54,160 --> 00:55:57,440
individual are the same thing and I

1512
00:55:55,599 --> 00:55:59,480
would say that's the core story in some

1513
00:55:57,440 --> 00:56:01,240
sense of the of Western culture is that

1514
00:55:59,480 --> 00:56:04,200
to aim high and to develop the

1515
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:05,960
autonomous individual are the same thing

1516
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:07,760
and that's what happens in Pinocchio

1517
00:56:05,960 --> 00:56:10,079
that's what happens in the story of

1518
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:13,000
Abraham and the transformation takes

1519
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:14,760
place the magical transformation and in

1520
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:16,520
the Pinocchio story one of the things

1521
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:19,000
that's so interesting about it and this

1522
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:21,079
is part of its mythological substructure

1523
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:24,359
from the scientific perspective there's

1524
00:56:21,079 --> 00:56:26,400
only two determining forces with regards

1525
00:56:24,359 --> 00:56:30,160
to the destiny of the individual there's

1526
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:33,480
nature deterministic and culture

1527
00:56:30,160 --> 00:56:35,280
deterministic and then Scholars Wrangle

1528
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:37,240
about which of those is the greater

1529
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:39,200
force but in mythological stories

1530
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:40,480
there's always a third element and that

1531
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:42,920
third element is something like

1532
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:44,760
autonomous Consciousness and there's no

1533
00:56:42,920 --> 00:56:46,599
place for autonomous Consciousness in

1534
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:49,039
the deterministic story of Nature and

1535
00:56:46,599 --> 00:56:52,160
culture but we all act as if autonomous

1536
00:56:49,039 --> 00:56:53,839
Consciousness is the primary reality and

1537
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:55,760
the biblical stories are predicated on

1538
00:56:53,839 --> 00:56:58,000
the idea that autonomous Consciousness

1539
00:56:55,760 --> 00:56:59,880
is what gives rise to the world and I

1540
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,160
don't think that we're in a position to

1541
00:56:59,880 --> 00:57:05,200
presume that that is necessarily an

1542
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:07,000
error and so what that means is to aim

1543
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:10,640
high and to develop the autonomous

1544
00:57:07,000 --> 00:57:13,960
individual is is simultaneously the

1545
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:16,599
decision to formulate an allegiance with

1546
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:19,440
the the conscious power that brings

1547
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:19,440
being into

1548
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:24,160
existence and that all takes place

1549
00:57:21,680 --> 00:57:26,880
inside this little puppet and then he

1550
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:30,039
has his adventures right he's he's he's

1551
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:32,400
still half jackass and half deceptive

1552
00:57:30,039 --> 00:57:35,240
but he still despite that and despite

1553
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:38,079
all the errors he has the capacity to

1554
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:40,720
move forward and to transform into

1555
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:42,680
something to transform himself into

1556
00:57:40,720 --> 00:57:46,039
something that can be properly

1557
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:49,880
considered described as a true Son of

1558
00:57:46,039 --> 00:57:49,880
God and that's the right

1559
00:57:50,799 --> 00:57:56,319
aim and it works like this as far as I

1560
00:57:53,359 --> 00:57:57,760
can tell you know when I had talked to

1561
00:57:56,319 --> 00:57:59,799
people about doing the future authoring

1562
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:02,760
program they often put it off and it's

1563
00:57:59,799 --> 00:58:04,000
not surprising because it's hard and and

1564
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:06,039
but it's more than that they think well

1565
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:08,240
I don't know how to write I'm going to

1566
00:58:06,039 --> 00:58:10,240
do a bad job I don't really like

1567
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:12,599
assignments I'm going to have to do it

1568
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:15,000
perfectly I need to wait till I have

1569
00:58:12,599 --> 00:58:16,839
enough time and like one of those is

1570
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:19,079
enough to stop your cold and all five of

1571
00:58:16,839 --> 00:58:21,960
them you're just done and so I tell

1572
00:58:19,079 --> 00:58:26,440
people do it halfhazard

1573
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:28,480
a tiny bit at a time and badly

1574
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:30,039
because you can do that I tell my

1575
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:32,520
students when they're doing their thesis

1576
00:58:30,039 --> 00:58:33,799
Master's thesis write a really bad first

1577
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:35,200
draft and then we have a little

1578
00:58:33,799 --> 00:58:37,720
conversation about that because they

1579
00:58:35,200 --> 00:58:40,160
don't think I mean that because it

1580
00:58:37,720 --> 00:58:44,559
sounds like a cliche in some sense it's

1581
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:44,559
not a cliche it's not a cliche at all it

1582
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:49,640
means you're a terrible writer but but

1583
00:58:48,359 --> 00:58:52,160
if someone put a gun to your head and

1584
00:58:49,640 --> 00:58:54,880
said you have to have your 100 page

1585
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:58,119
thesis done by next Monday or I'll shoot

1586
00:58:54,880 --> 00:59:00,319
you but I don't care how terrible it is

1587
00:58:58,119 --> 00:59:02,119
you would sit down and write it and the

1588
00:59:00,319 --> 00:59:03,599
thing is then you have it right then

1589
00:59:02,119 --> 00:59:05,920
then you have something and then you can

1590
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:08,319
fix it you can iterate and fix it that

1591
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:09,440
bad first draft that's the most valuable

1592
00:59:08,319 --> 00:59:11,880
thing and so that's what you need you

1593
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:14,920
need a bad first draft of

1594
00:59:11,880 --> 00:59:16,920
yourself and there's there's an idea

1595
00:59:14,920 --> 00:59:19,160
that Jung developed about the trickster

1596
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:20,960
and the jester the comedian right that

1597
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:22,839
the the trickster is the precursor to

1598
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:24,960
the Savior that's one of the things I

1599
00:59:22,839 --> 00:59:27,440
learned from Yung that was just it's so

1600
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:29,760
unlikely you never think that it's so

1601
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:32,760
amazing that that might be the case but

1602
00:59:29,760 --> 00:59:34,319
the the the the the SAT the satirical

1603
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:37,039
and the ironic and the and the

1604
00:59:34,319 --> 00:59:40,079
Troublemaker the the comedian the fool

1605
00:59:37,039 --> 00:59:41,920
the fool is the precursor to the Savior

1606
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:44,079
why because you're a fool when you start

1607
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:45,359
something new and so if you're not

1608
00:59:44,079 --> 00:59:46,559
willing to be a fool then you'll never

1609
00:59:45,359 --> 00:59:47,680
start anything new and if you never

1610
00:59:46,559 --> 00:59:50,280
start anything new then you won't

1611
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:52,799
develop and so the willingness to be a

1612
00:59:50,280 --> 00:59:54,520
fool is the precursor to transformation

1613
00:59:52,799 --> 00:59:56,200
and that's the same as humility and so

1614
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:58,160
if you're going to write your destiny

1615
00:59:56,200 --> 01:00:00,760
you can do a bad first job you're going

1616
00:59:58,160 --> 01:00:02,640
to get smarter As you move forward

1617
01:00:00,760 --> 01:00:04,440
that's the thing is that so something

1618
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:06,480
beckons to you that's what happens here

1619
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:08,880
maybe the star that jepetto wished on

1620
01:00:06,480 --> 01:00:11,359
was the wrong damn star but at least it

1621
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:14,720
was a star right at least it was in the

1622
01:00:11,359 --> 01:00:16,359
sky at least it moved him forward and so

1623
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:18,599
you say in your life well something

1624
01:00:16,359 --> 01:00:20,760
grips you and and and fills you with

1625
01:00:18,599 --> 01:00:24,280
interest and you think well should I do

1626
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:26,440
that and the answer is if not that then

1627
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:29,520
something'

1628
01:00:26,440 --> 01:00:32,000
what if it's a mistake it's a mistake

1629
01:00:29,520 --> 01:00:33,680
rest assured what do you know you're

1630
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,640
going to stumble around right and what's

1631
01:00:33,680 --> 01:00:37,079
going to happen is this you're going to

1632
01:00:35,640 --> 01:00:38,680
move to you're going to not stay in

1633
01:00:37,079 --> 01:00:40,680
stasis you're not going to wander around

1634
01:00:38,680 --> 01:00:42,119
in circles and I see people like that

1635
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:43,440
they said well I never knew what to do

1636
01:00:42,119 --> 01:00:46,799
and now I'm

1637
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:49,359
40 it's like that's not so good that's

1638
01:00:46,799 --> 01:00:50,960
not so good and you might say well and

1639
01:00:49,359 --> 01:00:54,200
there is a literature too that suggests

1640
01:00:50,960 --> 01:00:56,559
that people are a lot more unhappy when

1641
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:58,599
they look back on their lives about the

1642
01:00:56,559 --> 01:01:00,400
things they didn't do than they are

1643
01:00:58,599 --> 01:01:02,440
about the mistakes they made while they

1644
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:04,839
were doing things and so that's really

1645
01:01:02,440 --> 01:01:07,400
worth thinking about too because there's

1646
01:01:04,839 --> 01:01:08,920
Redemptive mistakes and a Redemptive

1647
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:10,240
mistake would be a mistake that you make

1648
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:11,960
when you go out and try to do something

1649
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:13,720
you know you actually you think okay I'm

1650
01:01:11,960 --> 01:01:15,400
going to try to do this and you're not

1651
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:17,359
good at it you make a bunch of mistakes

1652
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:19,240
it's like what what's the consequence if

1653
01:01:17,359 --> 01:01:21,200
you pay attention is you're not quite so

1654
01:01:19,240 --> 01:01:23,240
stupid anymore that's the thing is

1655
01:01:21,200 --> 01:01:24,839
you've been informed by your by the

1656
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:26,480
results of your errors and so what

1657
01:01:24,839 --> 01:01:28,720
happens is

1658
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:31,000
you you you follow the beacon you follow

1659
01:01:28,720 --> 01:01:32,440
the light and and you're blind so you

1660
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:34,799
don't know where the light is it's it's

1661
01:01:32,440 --> 01:01:36,839
dimly apprehended only and you're afraid

1662
01:01:34,799 --> 01:01:40,119
to follow it but you decide to take some

1663
01:01:36,839 --> 01:01:42,240
stumbling steps towards it and as you

1664
01:01:40,119 --> 01:01:44,640
take stumbling steps towards it you

1665
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:46,720
become illuminated and enlightened and

1666
01:01:44,640 --> 01:01:48,000
informed because of the nature of your

1667
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:49,400
experience because you're pushing

1668
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,359
yourself Beyond where you are and you're

1669
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:53,640
going into the country that you have not

1670
01:01:51,359 --> 01:01:56,640
yet been in and you learn something and

1671
01:01:53,640 --> 01:01:58,799
so what happens then is the star moves

1672
01:01:56,640 --> 01:02:00,520
you move 10t towards it and you think no

1673
01:01:58,799 --> 01:02:02,799
that's not right I didn't get it right

1674
01:02:00,520 --> 01:02:04,760
it isn't there it's actually there and

1675
01:02:02,799 --> 01:02:06,960
so then you you see it somewhere else

1676
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:10,359
and you shift yourself slightly and you

1677
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:14,400
move forward and that's what happens is

1678
01:02:10,359 --> 01:02:17,480
that you continue as you change the

1679
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:20,359
thing that guides you forward moves

1680
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:22,200
right it's like God in the in the in the

1681
01:02:20,359 --> 01:02:24,599
desert in Egypt the pillar of light that

1682
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:26,839
you're following it's moving it's not a

1683
01:02:24,599 --> 01:02:29,520
permanent thing you move towards it it

1684
01:02:26,839 --> 01:02:32,400
moves away it guides you forward and so

1685
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:34,359
you say well is what I'm aiming at

1686
01:02:32,400 --> 01:02:36,720
Paradise itself and the answer to that

1687
01:02:34,359 --> 01:02:38,359
is no because what do you know you you

1688
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:40,279
couldn't see Paradise if it was right in

1689
01:02:38,359 --> 01:02:43,160
front of you but you might get a glimmer

1690
01:02:40,279 --> 01:02:45,680
of it and so you move towards it and you

1691
01:02:43,160 --> 01:02:47,319
grow and then the next time you open

1692
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:49,240
your eyes you see a little bit more

1693
01:02:47,319 --> 01:02:51,400
clearly and that's what happens is that

1694
01:02:49,240 --> 01:02:53,359
just happens over and over right it

1695
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:57,799
keeps

1696
01:02:53,359 --> 01:02:59,760
moving and so you move like this

1697
01:02:57,799 --> 01:03:01,720
but the thing that's so cool is that all

1698
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:04,400
those zigs and zags you say and each of

1699
01:03:01,720 --> 01:03:06,599
those zags is and zigs is a catastrophy

1700
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:08,160
I hit a wall my God and then I had to

1701
01:03:06,599 --> 01:03:10,599
die a little bit and I barely got back

1702
01:03:08,160 --> 01:03:13,440
up it's a phoenix transformation at each

1703
01:03:10,599 --> 01:03:15,760
at each turn and it's painful but the

1704
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:18,720
thing is is that even though you've

1705
01:03:15,760 --> 01:03:20,680
you've traveled 20 miles let's say on

1706
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:23,279
that road and you've only moved three

1707
01:03:20,680 --> 01:03:25,440
miles forward you've moved three miles

1708
01:03:23,279 --> 01:03:27,279
forward instead of falling backwards

1709
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:30,760
because that's the thing too is that if

1710
01:03:27,279 --> 01:03:32,920
you stand still you fall backwards you

1711
01:03:30,760 --> 01:03:35,319
cannot stand still because the world

1712
01:03:32,920 --> 01:03:37,920
moves away from you if you stand still

1713
01:03:35,319 --> 01:03:39,920
and there's no stasis there's only

1714
01:03:37,920 --> 01:03:41,880
backwards and so if you're not moving

1715
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:46,200
backward back forwards then you're

1716
01:03:41,880 --> 01:03:46,200
moving backwards and that's

1717
01:03:46,520 --> 01:03:51,680
more more of the underlying truth of of

1718
01:03:49,279 --> 01:03:54,039
the Matthew principle to those who have

1719
01:03:51,680 --> 01:03:55,520
everything more will be given from those

1720
01:03:54,039 --> 01:03:58,799
who have nothing everything will be

1721
01:03:55,520 --> 01:04:01,319
taken taken it's a warning do not stay

1722
01:03:58,799 --> 01:04:01,319
in one

1723
01:04:02,319 --> 01:04:08,880
place well as you Zig and zag maybe the

1724
01:04:06,119 --> 01:04:10,720
maybe the cataclysm of each

1725
01:04:08,880 --> 01:04:12,839
transformation starts to lessen there's

1726
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:15,079
not so much of you that has to die with

1727
01:04:12,839 --> 01:04:17,839
every

1728
01:04:15,079 --> 01:04:19,960
mistake and maybe you end up oriented at

1729
01:04:17,839 --> 01:04:22,039
least reasonably properly and if you

1730
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:24,119
were sensible that would have been your

1731
01:04:22,039 --> 01:04:25,440
trip but it wasn't right it's that and

1732
01:04:24,119 --> 01:04:27,160
perhaps it's a lot worse than that

1733
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:28,720
perhaps per there's no shortage of

1734
01:04:27,160 --> 01:04:32,079
backtracking but it doesn't matter

1735
01:04:28,720 --> 01:04:34,799
because as you stumble forward you you

1736
01:04:32,079 --> 01:04:36,960
illuminate and inform yourself and

1737
01:04:34,799 --> 01:04:40,079
perhaps that's partly because the world

1738
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:42,720
is made of information and if you

1739
01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:45,079
encounter it and Tangle with it then it

1740
01:04:42,720 --> 01:04:47,319
informs you and then you become informed

1741
01:04:45,079 --> 01:04:49,640
and then you're information and then

1742
01:04:47,319 --> 01:04:49,640
you're

1743
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:57,640
ready and so God says to Abraham I will

1744
01:04:54,559 --> 01:04:57,640
make of thee a great name

1745
01:04:58,839 --> 01:05:05,319
and I will bless thee and make thy name

1746
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:05,319
great and thou shalt be a

1747
01:05:05,680 --> 01:05:14,000
blessing that's that's a good offer

1748
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:14,000
fundamentally I mean it

1749
01:05:14,359 --> 01:05:20,480
means what does it mean to to be made a

1750
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:21,799
great nation of well perhaps it has

1751
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:23,720
something to do directly with your

1752
01:05:21,799 --> 01:05:25,880
descendants but I don't think it's just

1753
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:28,079
that you know is if you're a force for

1754
01:05:25,880 --> 01:05:31,039
good in the world then that radiates out

1755
01:05:28,079 --> 01:05:32,680
from you and if you good enough it's

1756
01:05:31,039 --> 01:05:35,760
difficult to say how much of an impact

1757
01:05:32,680 --> 01:05:38,400
on things you could have you know dovi

1758
01:05:35,760 --> 01:05:41,599
who is a very crazy person partly

1759
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:43,319
because of his epilepsy he said a man is

1760
01:05:41,599 --> 01:05:44,680
not only responsible for everything he

1761
01:05:43,319 --> 01:05:47,119
does but for everything that everyone

1762
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:49,160
else does and you

1763
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:51,920
think well

1764
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:56,319
no no

1765
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:57,279
no and yes sometimes no

1766
01:05:56,319 --> 01:05:59,319
sometimes that's what you think if

1767
01:05:57,279 --> 01:06:01,760
you're cataclysmic cataclysmically

1768
01:05:59,319 --> 01:06:04,720
depressed right is that your sins are so

1769
01:06:01,760 --> 01:06:07,200
egregious that that they're unforgivable

1770
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:08,680
and that in some manner you're at you're

1771
01:06:07,200 --> 01:06:10,200
at fault for everything that's terrible

1772
01:06:08,680 --> 01:06:11,720
with the world but there's actually

1773
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:13,920
truth in that and there's actually

1774
01:06:11,720 --> 01:06:18,000
Redemptive truth in that is that things

1775
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:18,000
wouldn't be so bad if you weren't

1776
01:06:18,079 --> 01:06:23,599
so if you weren't so far from what you

1777
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:25,920
could be and that's terribly pessimistic

1778
01:06:23,599 --> 01:06:28,079
because it's all on you man but it's

1779
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:30,440
terribly optimistic because God there's

1780
01:06:28,079 --> 01:06:32,200
a lot of things that you could do and if

1781
01:06:30,440 --> 01:06:33,400
you're crying out for something to do

1782
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:35,880
then that's the best news you could

1783
01:06:33,400 --> 01:06:39,480
possibly have it's like things aren't so

1784
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:41,640
good but neither are you so if you stop

1785
01:06:39,480 --> 01:06:43,200
doing the things that you knew to be

1786
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:44,319
destructive which is the right place to

1787
01:06:43,200 --> 01:06:46,240
start you know if you're going to clean

1788
01:06:44,319 --> 01:06:48,440
up your room what do you do first well

1789
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:50,000
you just get rid of the mess you know

1790
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:52,079
and you know what not no one has to come

1791
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:54,680
in and tell you hopefully what's the

1792
01:06:52,079 --> 01:06:56,400
worst mess it's just it announces itself

1793
01:06:54,680 --> 01:06:57,799
to you and you can certainly know

1794
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:59,559
yourself and this is a very easy

1795
01:06:57,799 --> 01:07:01,920
meditative exercise to sit down and

1796
01:06:59,559 --> 01:07:04,559
think okay I'm doing one thing really

1797
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:05,920
stupidly that I should stop doing it's

1798
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:08,039
like how long is it going to take you to

1799
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:10,279
figure out what that is it's about two

1800
01:07:08,039 --> 01:07:12,200
seconds right you've known it forever

1801
01:07:10,279 --> 01:07:15,000
and you could even make it less

1802
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:18,000
demanding you could say there are some

1803
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:21,920
stupid things that I'm doing that I know

1804
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:25,720
are stupid and wrong that I could stop

1805
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:27,880
doing that I would stop doing

1806
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:29,359
and then you can just start with that

1807
01:07:27,880 --> 01:07:30,880
and you can just do that and maybe it's

1808
01:07:29,359 --> 01:07:33,559
just a little thing although it's not

1809
01:07:30,880 --> 01:07:35,279
because it's it's a it's a step forward

1810
01:07:33,559 --> 01:07:36,720
on the proper Voyage it's not a small

1811
01:07:35,279 --> 01:07:38,599
thing and you think well what would

1812
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:41,000
happened you could say let's do this for

1813
01:07:38,599 --> 01:07:42,920
a year or even a month just try not to

1814
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:45,160
do things you know to be stupid and

1815
01:07:42,920 --> 01:07:46,760
wrong for a month and that means not to

1816
01:07:45,160 --> 01:07:48,079
say things you know to be stupid and

1817
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:49,799
wrong as well maybe that's the most

1818
01:07:48,079 --> 01:07:52,039
important thing just do it as an

1819
01:07:49,799 --> 01:07:54,160
experiment see what happens and it's so

1820
01:07:52,039 --> 01:07:55,599
fun because I have people writing to me

1821
01:07:54,160 --> 01:07:57,200
from all over the world who are saying

1822
01:07:55,599 --> 01:07:59,520
they're doing that they're saying well

1823
01:07:57,200 --> 01:08:01,880
you know I cleaned up my room and and

1824
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:04,440
then I stopped saying stupid things and

1825
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:06,760
my God it's like things are way better

1826
01:08:04,440 --> 01:08:08,599
it's like who would have guessed it you

1827
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:12,240
know and

1828
01:08:08,599 --> 01:08:13,480
so it's lwh hanging fruit man because

1829
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:14,880
there's a that's the other thing if

1830
01:08:13,480 --> 01:08:16,359
there's a lot of things wrong with you

1831
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:18,480
then it's it's really easy to start

1832
01:08:16,359 --> 01:08:22,239
fixing it you know you got so much

1833
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:24,319
there's so much territory that you can

1834
01:08:22,239 --> 01:08:26,920
inhabit I will make of thee a great

1835
01:08:24,319 --> 01:08:28,400
nation I Will Bless thee that's good I

1836
01:08:26,920 --> 01:08:30,400
mean the whole nation thing that's

1837
01:08:28,400 --> 01:08:34,000
positive but to have God on your side

1838
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:36,279
that's you know you might want that when

1839
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:39,440
things get rough that would be good and

1840
01:08:36,279 --> 01:08:41,120
make thy name great and thou shalt be a

1841
01:08:39,440 --> 01:08:43,239
blessing

1842
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:45,600
wonderful that's a good

1843
01:08:43,239 --> 01:08:48,040
deal and I will bless them that bless

1844
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:50,239
thee that's good too and curse him that

1845
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:53,239
curseth thee and in thee shall all

1846
01:08:50,239 --> 01:08:57,440
families of the earth be

1847
01:08:53,239 --> 01:08:57,440
blessed that's something

1848
01:08:57,880 --> 01:09:02,679
that's something wouldn't it be

1849
01:08:59,120 --> 01:09:05,159
something if you could wake up and your

1850
01:09:02,679 --> 01:09:06,719
day was cons composed in part of people

1851
01:09:05,159 --> 01:09:09,000
thanking you for all the good things

1852
01:09:06,719 --> 01:09:11,239
you've done in the world wouldn't that

1853
01:09:09,000 --> 01:09:11,239
be

1854
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:16,799
good it's not impossible for that to

1855
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:20,000
happen so Abram

1856
01:09:16,799 --> 01:09:22,159
departed yes as the Lord had spoken unto

1857
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:24,080
him and lot went with him and Abram was

1858
01:09:22,159 --> 01:09:26,480
7 and five years when he departed out of

1859
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:28,719
heran

1860
01:09:26,480 --> 01:09:30,560
that's old now Abraham lives a long time

1861
01:09:28,719 --> 01:09:32,560
but this is also part of the story so he

1862
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:34,159
has a wife who can't have children he

1863
01:09:32,560 --> 01:09:36,600
has nothing obviously he's been hanging

1864
01:09:34,159 --> 01:09:39,199
around dad's Shack for a little too long

1865
01:09:36,600 --> 01:09:41,120
given that he's 75 right it's time it's

1866
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:44,359
time to get a fire lit underneath him a

1867
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:46,440
bit and so he's not got much going for

1868
01:09:44,359 --> 01:09:48,000
him but he still decides to to move

1869
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:50,359
forward and I've seen this too you know

1870
01:09:48,000 --> 01:09:52,719
like if you don't have your destiny in

1871
01:09:50,359 --> 01:09:54,960
Hand by your time you're 30 it's it's

1872
01:09:52,719 --> 01:09:56,480
rough you start hurting and if you don't

1873
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:58,840
have your Destiny at Hand by the time

1874
01:09:56,480 --> 01:10:02,520
you're 40 then you really start hurting

1875
01:09:58,840 --> 01:10:02,520
and 40 is a

1876
01:10:02,719 --> 01:10:07,840
real fork in the

1877
01:10:05,679 --> 01:10:10,159
road the fork in the road that's always

1878
01:10:07,840 --> 01:10:11,480
where you meet the Devil by the way and

1879
01:10:10,159 --> 01:10:14,239
that's because every time you have to

1880
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:16,400
make a decision the possibility of evil

1881
01:10:14,239 --> 01:10:17,719
beckons that's why that is I had a

1882
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:20,560
friend I've told you a little about him

1883
01:10:17,719 --> 01:10:22,600
and he killed himself just after 40 know

1884
01:10:20,560 --> 01:10:24,400
he had had a book published with a very

1885
01:10:22,600 --> 01:10:26,280
small press he was quite a good writer

1886
01:10:24,400 --> 01:10:28,560
but he could could not get himself

1887
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:30,120
together and it hit him too hard at 40

1888
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:32,560
and I'm not saying that it's hopeless at

1889
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:33,800
40 I'm not saying that and and I'm not

1890
01:10:32,560 --> 01:10:35,320
saying that partly because of these

1891
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:37,040
verses but also partly because of what

1892
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:39,360
I've seen in my clinical practice I've

1893
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:42,520
had people come to me who have had very

1894
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:45,280
chaotic and ill-spent lives let's say

1895
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:47,080
who were in that neighborhood of Age and

1896
01:10:45,280 --> 01:10:50,360
and it's true for people who are older

1897
01:10:47,080 --> 01:10:52,960
as well who then decided to make a real

1898
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:54,800
effort and to try to make where they

1899
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:57,560
were better you know instead of being

1900
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:59,080
bitter out where they weren't because

1901
01:10:57,560 --> 01:11:01,560
that's the bitterness that really does

1902
01:10:59,080 --> 01:11:04,000
you in it's really not good it's the

1903
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:05,760
opposite of gratitude it's it's it's the

1904
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:07,600
manifestation of resentment it makes you

1905
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:10,080
malevolent it's very very bad to be

1906
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:13,719
bitter it's not it's

1907
01:11:10,080 --> 01:11:15,920
not it's hell to be

1908
01:11:13,719 --> 01:11:17,480
bitter and if you're 40 and you're not

1909
01:11:15,920 --> 01:11:19,679
successful then you have to accept your

1910
01:11:17,480 --> 01:11:21,560
lot and you have to start to improve

1911
01:11:19,679 --> 01:11:23,120
what's right in front of you and if you

1912
01:11:21,560 --> 01:11:25,400
do that it doesn't take very long it's

1913
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:27,040
quite interesting to watch people things

1914
01:11:25,400 --> 01:11:28,960
be a lot better in 6 months and they can

1915
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:31,320
be way better in 2 years like it's a

1916
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:33,880
struggle uphill struggle but it's by no

1917
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:35,199
means impossible and and I don't know

1918
01:11:33,880 --> 01:11:36,880
again what the limit of that is I

1919
01:11:35,199 --> 01:11:38,960
suppose it depends to degree to some

1920
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:40,639
degree on the degree of your commitment

1921
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:42,920
but anyway so Abra it's another

1922
01:11:40,639 --> 01:11:45,239
indication of the the real validity of

1923
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:48,679
this story God isn't setting this up to

1924
01:11:45,239 --> 01:11:50,800
be easy right Abraham's old and and and

1925
01:11:48,679 --> 01:11:52,760
his and his wife is old too and more

1926
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:54,440
than that she's Barren how is he going

1927
01:11:52,760 --> 01:11:57,840
to be the father of Nations how is he

1928
01:11:54,440 --> 01:12:01,520
going to be successful ful well the

1929
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:05,639
initial departure point is insufficient

1930
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:09,120
radically insufficient and and that's

1931
01:12:05,639 --> 01:12:11,199
very inspiring because it means that you

1932
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:13,719
can start from where you

1933
01:12:11,199 --> 01:12:15,760
are so Abram departed as the Lord had

1934
01:12:13,719 --> 01:12:17,639
spoken unto him and lot went with him

1935
01:12:15,760 --> 01:12:19,360
and Abram was 75 years old when he

1936
01:12:17,639 --> 01:12:21,440
departed out of heran and Abraham took

1937
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:23,400
sarai's wife and and lot his brother's

1938
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:24,159
son and all their substance that they

1939
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:26,120
had

1940
01:12:24,159 --> 01:12:27,920
gathered and you know he has a

1941
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:30,080
relationship with lot right he doesn't

1942
01:12:27,920 --> 01:12:32,280
have his own son but he his brother died

1943
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:34,880
and so he takes his nephew as his son

1944
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:37,000
that's grateful you know he could be

1945
01:12:34,880 --> 01:12:38,280
very angry and and have nothing to do

1946
01:12:37,000 --> 01:12:39,880
with him because he didn't get his own

1947
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:42,000
son but that isn't that isn't what

1948
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:44,719
happens is he's offered a substitute

1949
01:12:42,000 --> 01:12:47,840
let's say and he accepts it and so good

1950
01:12:44,719 --> 01:12:50,120
for him you know and and

1951
01:12:47,840 --> 01:12:52,679
that's and that's also something that

1952
01:12:50,120 --> 01:12:54,679
I've seen that characterizes people who

1953
01:12:52,679 --> 01:12:55,760
can make the best of a bad lot is they

1954
01:12:54,679 --> 01:12:57,080
don't get

1955
01:12:55,760 --> 01:12:59,639
exactly what they want but something

1956
01:12:57,080 --> 01:13:00,400
comes along that offers possibilities

1957
01:12:59,639 --> 01:13:03,400
that

1958
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:05,639
are sufficient perhaps if exploited

1959
01:13:03,400 --> 01:13:07,560
properly and they open their heart and

1960
01:13:05,639 --> 01:13:09,560
welcom them in instead of rejecting them

1961
01:13:07,560 --> 01:13:12,199
in bitterness and so that's a good thing

1962
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:14,560
and that's part of Abraham's

1963
01:13:12,199 --> 01:13:16,080
character and Abram took sarai's wife

1964
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:17,600
and lot his brother's son and all their

1965
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:19,320
substance that they had gathered and all

1966
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:20,760
the souls that they had gotten in heran

1967
01:13:19,320 --> 01:13:23,320
and they went forth to go into the land

1968
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:26,520
of Canaan into Exile let's say and into

1969
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:27,400
the land of Canaan they came

1970
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:30,199
and that's

1971
01:13:27,400 --> 01:13:32,320
another repetition of the transformation

1972
01:13:30,199 --> 01:13:34,920
story right you have to go to a land

1973
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:34,920
where you're not

1974
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:39,840
welcome and Abram passed through the

1975
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:41,760
land unto the place of sichem Unto the

1976
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:43,480
plain of morah and the Canaanite was

1977
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:45,400
then in the land and the Lord appeared

1978
01:13:43,480 --> 01:13:47,440
unto Abram and said unto thy seed I will

1979
01:13:45,400 --> 01:13:49,880
give you this land and there he build an

1980
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:52,040
altar to the Lord who appeared unto him

1981
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:53,600
and he removed from then unto a mountain

1982
01:13:52,040 --> 01:13:55,360
on the east of bethl and pitched his

1983
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:57,199
tent having bethl on the west and high

1984
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:58,679
on the East and there he built an altar

1985
01:13:57,199 --> 01:14:01,679
unto the Lord and called upon the name

1986
01:13:58,679 --> 01:14:04,360
of the Lord now we don't understand

1987
01:14:01,679 --> 01:14:06,480
these rituals precisely you know I don't

1988
01:14:04,360 --> 01:14:09,120
know if the people who did this engaged

1989
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:11,560
in a meditative ritual was that the idea

1990
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:14,560
that you take something of value you do

1991
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:16,560
this you you undertake this dramatic

1992
01:14:14,560 --> 01:14:18,560
transformation a life and death

1993
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:20,679
transformation and is that an aid to

1994
01:14:18,560 --> 01:14:23,360
meditation and what do you do do you sit

1995
01:14:20,679 --> 01:14:26,159
down and think do you do you pray pray

1996
01:14:23,360 --> 01:14:28,800
being to ask you know to what do I do

1997
01:14:26,159 --> 01:14:31,120
next how do I Orient myself in the world

1998
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:32,159
it's a useful exercise to do that to I

1999
01:14:31,120 --> 01:14:34,239
think it's something that people could

2000
01:14:32,159 --> 01:14:36,639
do every morning I think it's useful to

2001
01:14:34,239 --> 01:14:38,159
sit down and think okay what's the most

2002
01:14:36,639 --> 01:14:40,440
important thing I should do

2003
01:14:38,159 --> 01:14:44,040
today what I have an array of things

2004
01:14:40,440 --> 01:14:47,040
that call to me to be done some of which

2005
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:49,920
I will do with joy and some of which I

2006
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:52,000
will bear as responsibilities but I they

2007
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:54,600
array themselves in front of me and what

2008
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:58,040
what should I attend to First well do

2009
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:59,719
you ask or do you decide and it seems to

2010
01:14:58,040 --> 01:15:01,480
me when I do it because I do it all the

2011
01:14:59,719 --> 01:15:03,440
time I do it every morning I try to sit

2012
01:15:01,480 --> 01:15:05,360
down and think okay I've got things that

2013
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:07,000
I would like to do and things that call

2014
01:15:05,360 --> 01:15:09,600
to me out of

2015
01:15:07,000 --> 01:15:11,800
necessity what do I do first and it's

2016
01:15:09,600 --> 01:15:14,239
not so much a decision as it is a

2017
01:15:11,800 --> 01:15:15,840
question and and I don't know what I'm

2018
01:15:14,239 --> 01:15:18,480
calling on it's I'm calling on my

2019
01:15:15,840 --> 01:15:20,320
capacity to think I suppose but that's

2020
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:24,400
not my capacity

2021
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:26,400
exactly I I'm I I can I can commune with

2022
01:15:24,400 --> 01:15:29,199
whatever provides answers and I can

2023
01:15:26,400 --> 01:15:31,960
think that that's me thinking

2024
01:15:29,199 --> 01:15:33,880
but and it isn't that I believe that I

2025
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:35,280
can't think I do believe that I can

2026
01:15:33,880 --> 01:15:37,520
consciously think but that's not the

2027
01:15:35,280 --> 01:15:39,840
same as calling for inspiration it's not

2028
01:15:37,520 --> 01:15:41,280
the same process just like a dream is

2029
01:15:39,840 --> 01:15:42,880
not conscious thinking it's something

2030
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:44,199
that happens to you and that kind of

2031
01:15:42,880 --> 01:15:46,080
inspiration is also something that

2032
01:15:44,199 --> 01:15:47,760
happens to you because I ask myself well

2033
01:15:46,080 --> 01:15:51,280
what's the most important thing I could

2034
01:15:47,760 --> 01:15:53,000
do next and then I have an answer to

2035
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:55,199
that but it isn't because I decided

2036
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:56,520
exactly I've decided that I'll do it

2037
01:15:55,199 --> 01:15:59,199
whatever it is and that I want to know

2038
01:15:56,520 --> 01:16:01,840
what it is those are the decisions but

2039
01:15:59,199 --> 01:16:05,000
but there's an involuntary aspect to the

2040
01:16:01,840 --> 01:16:07,000
Sorting that occurs and and that's the

2041
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:09,880
psychological equivalent I suppose to

2042
01:16:07,000 --> 01:16:13,520
this and I guess the sacrifice

2043
01:16:09,880 --> 01:16:17,800
is when I feel that I will do whatever

2044
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:19,440
it is that calls to be done then I don't

2045
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:21,440
do the other things that I might want to

2046
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:23,880
do and that's a

2047
01:16:21,440 --> 01:16:27,080
sacrifice it's to me it's the proper

2048
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:29,280
sacrifice because my sense is that

2049
01:16:27,080 --> 01:16:32,120
things don't go properly unless you do

2050
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:35,880
what's most important and if I want

2051
01:16:32,120 --> 01:16:37,760
things to go properly and I do because

2052
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:40,800
I've had my taste of things not going

2053
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:42,880
properly I want things to go properly

2054
01:16:40,800 --> 01:16:45,520
and so

2055
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:48,880
then it's not so difficult to do what's

2056
01:16:45,520 --> 01:16:52,120
necessary to to do what makes things go

2057
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:55,040
properly under those circumstances and

2058
01:16:52,120 --> 01:16:56,719
it's hardly

2059
01:16:55,040 --> 01:16:58,960
see this is partly why the story of

2060
01:16:56,719 --> 01:17:01,639
Sodom and Gomorrah is embedded in the

2061
01:16:58,960 --> 01:17:04,480
abrahamic stories I think because that's

2062
01:17:01,639 --> 01:17:08,280
an apocalyptic story right if things go

2063
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:10,600
badly enough the whole city is

2064
01:17:08,280 --> 01:17:12,199
destroyed and then and the reason it

2065
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:15,760
goes badly is because the people in the

2066
01:17:12,199 --> 01:17:18,600
city do not behave properly and the

2067
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:20,560
people in the city might be you and so

2068
01:17:18,600 --> 01:17:23,239
if you're not behaving properly then you

2069
01:17:20,560 --> 01:17:25,440
go and so does the city and maybe you

2070
01:17:23,239 --> 01:17:27,320
don't want maybe you do want that but

2071
01:17:25,440 --> 01:17:29,360
maybe you don't want that and if you

2072
01:17:27,320 --> 01:17:31,840
don't want that then maybe and you know

2073
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:33,320
that if you don't do things properly

2074
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:35,800
then it's you and the city if you

2075
01:17:33,320 --> 01:17:37,440
actually know that then maybe that

2076
01:17:35,800 --> 01:17:39,080
terrifies you badly enough so that

2077
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:40,920
you're willing to make the sacrifice to

2078
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:42,159
do the right things instead of the

2079
01:17:40,920 --> 01:17:44,840
impulsive things that you might

2080
01:17:42,159 --> 01:17:44,840
otherwise want to

2081
01:17:45,560 --> 01:17:51,360
do you know I learned from Victor Frankl

2082
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:53,760
and from Carl Jong and from Alexander

2083
01:17:51,360 --> 01:17:56,679
Sol niton and from many of the people

2084
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:59,080
whose works on the Holocaust that I read

2085
01:17:56,679 --> 01:18:01,360
and on the catastrophes in the Soviet

2086
01:17:59,080 --> 01:18:04,360
Union and the people who' studied it

2087
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:06,840
most deeply always came to the same

2088
01:18:04,360 --> 01:18:08,800
conclusion the state became corrupted

2089
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:11,440
because each individual allowed

2090
01:18:08,800 --> 01:18:13,840
themselves to be corrupted or perhaps

2091
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:15,719
participated joyfully in the process of

2092
01:18:13,840 --> 01:18:18,960
being corrupted and the consequence of

2093
01:18:15,719 --> 01:18:21,280
that was the end of the

2094
01:18:18,960 --> 01:18:23,719
world and so what that means is that if

2095
01:18:21,280 --> 01:18:26,199
you don't behave properly then you bring

2096
01:18:23,719 --> 01:18:27,600
about the end of the world

2097
01:18:26,199 --> 01:18:30,000
and maybe you think well that's only the

2098
01:18:27,600 --> 01:18:31,520
end of your world fair enough or maybe

2099
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:33,840
it's the only the end of your family's

2100
01:18:31,520 --> 01:18:36,679
world you know which I suppose might

2101
01:18:33,840 --> 01:18:39,560
give you some pause but there's more to

2102
01:18:36,679 --> 01:18:44,600
it than that because you're connected to

2103
01:18:39,560 --> 01:18:44,600
everyone else and what you do that isn't

2104
01:18:44,679 --> 01:18:50,000
good distributes itself and all the

2105
01:18:47,400 --> 01:18:51,960
things you don't do that could be good

2106
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:55,280
take away from the

2107
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:56,639
whole and so if you know that and I do

2108
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:59,960
think you know that if you take it

2109
01:18:56,639 --> 01:19:03,320
seriously because if you look

2110
01:18:59,960 --> 01:19:05,159
at if you look at the historical events

2111
01:19:03,320 --> 01:19:07,800
the cataclysmic events of the 20th

2112
01:19:05,159 --> 01:19:11,679
century seriously I do not think that

2113
01:19:07,800 --> 01:19:11,679
you can fail to come to that

2114
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:19,480
conclusion and Abraham journeyed going

2115
01:19:16,320 --> 01:19:22,239
on still towards the

2116
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:24,480
South that's interesting because to go

2117
01:19:22,239 --> 01:19:27,960
south means to go downhill to it's not

2118
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:30,560
good to go south it's colloquial for

2119
01:19:27,960 --> 01:19:32,280
going to where you shouldn't go and so

2120
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:37,000
this is what happens to Abraham you know

2121
01:19:32,280 --> 01:19:38,800
he his Ascent is preceded by a descent

2122
01:19:37,000 --> 01:19:41,320
and that's very common in life I would

2123
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:44,239
say and so

2124
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:47,159
so the Redemptive element of this

2125
01:19:44,239 --> 01:19:49,440
narrative is that if the Covenant is

2126
01:19:47,159 --> 01:19:52,120
constructed properly so it's an arc

2127
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:55,040
which is your decision to align yourself

2128
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:58,320
with God for all intents and purpos says

2129
01:19:55,040 --> 01:20:00,880
then even the journey South can be part

2130
01:19:58,320 --> 01:20:04,320
of a broader Journey

2131
01:20:00,880 --> 01:20:07,600
upward and there was a famine in the

2132
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:09,679
land that's Mother Nature failing to

2133
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:11,239
cooperate I mean that's got to be pretty

2134
01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:12,800
disheartening for Abraham don't you

2135
01:20:11,239 --> 01:20:16,280
think because he finally gets it

2136
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:17,920
together when he's 75 to leave and then

2137
01:20:16,280 --> 01:20:20,280
you know because God says well it's you

2138
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:22,080
know get going and and so the first

2139
01:20:20,280 --> 01:20:23,760
place he goes everyone's starving to

2140
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:26,000
death it's like you know you might think

2141
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:29,159
about that as a test of Faith wouldn't

2142
01:20:26,000 --> 01:20:31,400
you say but he keeps going and then what

2143
01:20:29,159 --> 01:20:33,600
happens well he has to go to Egypt so

2144
01:20:31,400 --> 01:20:35,719
great he goes where he's starving where

2145
01:20:33,600 --> 01:20:37,600
everyone's starving and then to get away

2146
01:20:35,719 --> 01:20:38,679
from where everyone's starving he goes

2147
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:41,080
to a

2148
01:20:38,679 --> 01:20:43,199
tyranny so the whole beginning of the

2149
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:45,239
story is not particularly

2150
01:20:43,199 --> 01:20:47,040
auspicious and Abram went down into

2151
01:20:45,239 --> 01:20:48,679
Egypt to sojourn there for the famine

2152
01:20:47,040 --> 01:20:51,560
was Grievous in the

2153
01:20:48,679 --> 01:20:53,920
land it's a repetition of the same idea

2154
01:20:51,560 --> 01:20:55,600
again there's downhill Voyage out into

2155
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:57,840
chaos right it's it's repeated over and

2156
01:20:55,600 --> 01:21:01,800
over that the beginning of Abraham's

2157
01:20:57,840 --> 01:21:04,719
journey is basically a sequence of of EX

2158
01:21:01,800 --> 01:21:06,960
of experiences of Exile chaos tyranny

2159
01:21:04,719 --> 01:21:08,440
and catastrophe well you should be able

2160
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:10,920
to relate to that you know how hard it

2161
01:21:08,440 --> 01:21:13,719
is to get things together you know you

2162
01:21:10,920 --> 01:21:16,239
go out to do what you're supposed to do

2163
01:21:13,719 --> 01:21:18,920
say and there's you're beset by the

2164
01:21:16,239 --> 01:21:20,040
intransigence of the world and failure

2165
01:21:18,920 --> 01:21:22,400
well so what are you supposed to do

2166
01:21:20,040 --> 01:21:25,520
about that

2167
01:21:22,400 --> 01:21:27,960
well maintain your faith in the good and

2168
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:30,000
continue to move forward that's the idea

2169
01:21:27,960 --> 01:21:32,120
and part of that even if even if you

2170
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:33,280
don't buy the metaphor it's like what

2171
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:36,600
are you going to do

2172
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:39,360
instead that won't make it

2173
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:42,159
worse so even if there if it isn't an up

2174
01:21:39,360 --> 01:21:44,560
that you're pursuing you're at least

2175
01:21:42,159 --> 01:21:46,760
forestalling the transformation of the

2176
01:21:44,560 --> 01:21:49,320
chaos into your of your life into sheer

2177
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:51,280
hell and that can certainly happen you

2178
01:21:49,320 --> 01:21:53,600
know you see people who are having a

2179
01:21:51,280 --> 01:21:55,360
terrible time and then you see people

2180
01:21:53,600 --> 01:21:58,120
who are having a terrible time who are

2181
01:21:55,360 --> 01:22:00,320
also in hell and it's a lot better to

2182
01:21:58,120 --> 01:22:04,520
just have a terrible time than to have a

2183
01:22:00,320 --> 01:22:06,880
terrible time and be in hell at the same

2184
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:08,960
time and it came to pass when he was

2185
01:22:06,880 --> 01:22:11,000
come to near to enter into Egypt that he

2186
01:22:08,960 --> 01:22:12,719
said unto Sariah's wife behold now I

2187
01:22:11,000 --> 01:22:14,719
know that thou art a fair woman to look

2188
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:16,600
upon therefore it shall come to pass

2189
01:22:14,719 --> 01:22:18,159
when the Egyptians shall see thee that

2190
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:20,159
they shall say this is his wife and they

2191
01:22:18,159 --> 01:22:22,800
will kill me but they will save thee

2192
01:22:20,159 --> 01:22:25,199
alive so look I mean Abraham is Abraham

2193
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:27,280
is really having a rough time he's a

2194
01:22:25,199 --> 01:22:29,320
failure right I mean he's wandering

2195
01:22:27,280 --> 01:22:31,400
around through the land of starvation

2196
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:34,719
now he's going to go be a quasi slave in

2197
01:22:31,400 --> 01:22:37,360
Egypt he has this incredibly attractive

2198
01:22:34,719 --> 01:22:40,800
wife and all he can look forward to is

2199
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:44,679
the fact that the most successful man in

2200
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:47,400
Egypt the Pharaoh will take her from him

2201
01:22:44,679 --> 01:22:49,400
so he's got the whole embitterment thing

2202
01:22:47,400 --> 01:22:51,239
pretty much nailed down as far as I can

2203
01:22:49,400 --> 01:22:54,199
tell and this is when he makes one of

2204
01:22:51,239 --> 01:22:57,560
his errors let's say and one of the

2205
01:22:54,199 --> 01:22:59,560
errors that humanizes him say I pray

2206
01:22:57,560 --> 01:23:01,880
thee that thou art my sister that it may

2207
01:22:59,560 --> 01:23:03,760
be well for me for thy sake and my soul

2208
01:23:01,880 --> 01:23:06,400
shall live because of

2209
01:23:03,760 --> 01:23:08,120
thee and it came to pass that when Abram

2210
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:09,880
was come into Egypt the Egyptians beheld

2211
01:23:08,120 --> 01:23:11,639
the woman that she was very fair the

2212
01:23:09,880 --> 01:23:13,360
princes also of pharaoh saw her and

2213
01:23:11,639 --> 01:23:15,280
commended her before pharaoh and the

2214
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:17,840
woman was taken into Pharaoh's house and

2215
01:23:15,280 --> 01:23:19,960
he entreated Abram well for her sake and

2216
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:21,600
he had sheep and oxen and he asses and

2217
01:23:19,960 --> 01:23:23,880
Men servants and Maid servants and she

2218
01:23:21,600 --> 01:23:26,239
asses and camels so actually things work

2219
01:23:23,880 --> 01:23:28,040
out pretty well for for Abram despite

2220
01:23:26,239 --> 01:23:31,239
his deceit right which is quite

2221
01:23:28,040 --> 01:23:33,639
interesting and I guess it's because if

2222
01:23:31,239 --> 01:23:35,159
the overarching structure is solid

2223
01:23:33,639 --> 01:23:39,280
something like that it's something like

2224
01:23:35,159 --> 01:23:41,360
that then then errors can still be

2225
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:43,360
forgiven to speak about it from a

2226
01:23:41,360 --> 01:23:45,560
metaphorical

2227
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:47,120
perspective and the Lord plagued pharaoh

2228
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:49,480
and his house with great plagues because

2229
01:23:47,120 --> 01:23:53,960
of Sarai Abram's

2230
01:23:49,480 --> 01:23:56,199
wife well it doesn't seem very fair but

2231
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:58,280
because the Pharaoh didn't know but but

2232
01:23:56,199 --> 01:23:59,840
it's not the right way to look at it the

2233
01:23:58,280 --> 01:24:02,520
right way to look at it see there's a

2234
01:23:59,840 --> 01:24:06,320
story later in the in the Bible about

2235
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:08,480
David and David David could be a pretty

2236
01:24:06,320 --> 01:24:11,480
bad guy you know so one of the things he

2237
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:14,040
does is when he becomes king he he's in

2238
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:17,520
his castle and he's looking over the

2239
01:24:14,040 --> 01:24:20,440
city and he sees a woman nude ba bathing

2240
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:23,280
nude sunbathing nude on on a on a a roof

2241
01:24:20,440 --> 01:24:26,360
out on the city and he's Smitten by her

2242
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:28,960
floored by her and he has inquiries made

2243
01:24:26,360 --> 01:24:31,880
about who she is her name is ba Sheba

2244
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:33,880
and and he finds out who her husband is

2245
01:24:31,880 --> 01:24:36,239
and her husband actually happens to be a

2246
01:24:33,880 --> 01:24:40,560
general in his

2247
01:24:36,239 --> 01:24:42,800
army and he arranges for that General to

2248
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:46,000
be put at the thick of the battle and

2249
01:24:42,800 --> 01:24:49,719
killed and then he takes baath

2250
01:24:46,000 --> 01:24:52,600
Sheba so and and

2251
01:24:49,719 --> 01:24:54,639
and the Lord is not pleased by that

2252
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:56,440
let's put it that way and that's

2253
01:24:54,639 --> 01:25:00,080
interesting you know it's it's an

2254
01:24:56,440 --> 01:25:01,480
interesting story because you might say

2255
01:25:00,080 --> 01:25:04,480
well why can't the king do whatever the

2256
01:25:01,480 --> 01:25:07,400
hell he wants like seriously he's the

2257
01:25:04,480 --> 01:25:09,520
king he's not just and he's not like the

2258
01:25:07,400 --> 01:25:12,280
prime minister or the President right he

2259
01:25:09,520 --> 01:25:14,880
he's the king and so you might say well

2260
01:25:12,280 --> 01:25:17,320
why is the king subject to any rules

2261
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:20,320
whatsoever what's the rationale for the

2262
01:25:17,320 --> 01:25:22,119
king being subject to rules well the

2263
01:25:20,320 --> 01:25:25,000
rational emerges in these stories is

2264
01:25:22,119 --> 01:25:28,199
there are social strictures

2265
01:25:25,000 --> 01:25:30,719
that are such that even if the ruler of

2266
01:25:28,199 --> 01:25:32,840
the land transgresses against them there

2267
01:25:30,719 --> 01:25:34,679
will be hell to pay and that's

2268
01:25:32,840 --> 01:25:36,760
continually presented over and over in

2269
01:25:34,679 --> 01:25:39,480
the biblical stories and it's a natural

2270
01:25:36,760 --> 01:25:42,639
law sort of idea it's that there are

2271
01:25:39,480 --> 01:25:46,040
there are intrinsic rules to the game of

2272
01:25:42,639 --> 01:25:49,000
social human being and if you and maybe

2273
01:25:46,040 --> 01:25:51,800
intrinsic rules to the to the Natural

2274
01:25:49,000 --> 01:25:55,119
State of human being you break those

2275
01:25:51,800 --> 01:25:57,560
rules consciously or uncons iously at

2276
01:25:55,119 --> 01:25:59,920
your absolute Peril and not only at your

2277
01:25:57,560 --> 01:26:02,440
peril but at the Peril of the state and

2278
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:04,639
it doesn't matter who you are and so I

2279
01:26:02,440 --> 01:26:06,960
would say this is actually an indication

2280
01:26:04,639 --> 01:26:09,920
of God being fair rather than being

2281
01:26:06,960 --> 01:26:11,000
unfair because the rule here is Pharaoh

2282
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:13,760
or

2283
01:26:11,000 --> 01:26:16,920
not you don't get to take someone else's

2284
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:18,719
wife and ignorance is no excuse now you

2285
01:26:16,920 --> 01:26:20,360
might say that's a little bit harsh and

2286
01:26:18,719 --> 01:26:22,560
perhaps it is a little bit harsh but

2287
01:26:20,360 --> 01:26:25,840
it's not without Merit the idea is not

2288
01:26:22,560 --> 01:26:31,159
without Merit and of course Abram

2289
01:26:25,840 --> 01:26:33,480
is complicit in this despite that he is

2290
01:26:31,159 --> 01:26:35,600
successful and Pharaoh called Abram and

2291
01:26:33,480 --> 01:26:37,520
said what is this that thou Hast done

2292
01:26:35,600 --> 01:26:40,520
unto me why did thou now tell me that

2293
01:26:37,520 --> 01:26:43,080
she was thy wife why said thou you she

2294
01:26:40,520 --> 01:26:46,320
is my sister I might have taken her to

2295
01:26:43,080 --> 01:26:48,600
me to wife now therefore Behold thy wife

2296
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:50,080
take her and go thy way and Pharaoh

2297
01:26:48,600 --> 01:26:51,600
commanded his men concerning him and

2298
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:52,560
they sent him away and his wife and all

2299
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:54,880
that he

2300
01:26:52,560 --> 01:26:56,520
had and Abram went up out of Egypt he

2301
01:26:54,880 --> 01:26:58,360
and his wife and all that he had and lot

2302
01:26:56,520 --> 01:27:00,719
with him into the South and Abram was

2303
01:26:58,360 --> 01:27:03,679
very rich in cattle in silver and in

2304
01:27:00,719 --> 01:27:07,040
gold and that's so it's interesting you

2305
01:27:03,679 --> 01:27:09,400
know Abraham he he goes to the place of

2306
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:11,960
famine and then he goes to the to the

2307
01:27:09,400 --> 01:27:14,440
place of terity and then he he lies and

2308
01:27:11,960 --> 01:27:16,600
then he almost loses his wife but

2309
01:27:14,440 --> 01:27:21,760
because he

2310
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:24,440
goes things work out for him and so hoay

2311
01:27:21,760 --> 01:27:26,000
for that and he went on his JY journees

2312
01:27:24,440 --> 01:27:27,239
from the south even to bethl unto the

2313
01:27:26,000 --> 01:27:29,159
place where his tent had been at the

2314
01:27:27,239 --> 01:27:30,840
beginning between bethl and high unto

2315
01:27:29,159 --> 01:27:32,800
the place of the altar so he makes

2316
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:34,800
another sacrifice which he had made

2317
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:36,400
there at the first and there Abram

2318
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:38,600
called on the name of the Lord well so

2319
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:41,719
he's had an adventure right he's he's

2320
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:43,639
he's he's finished his journey and and

2321
01:27:41,719 --> 01:27:44,679
so there's a culminating point in this

2322
01:27:43,639 --> 01:27:46,679
narrative and now he doesn't know what

2323
01:27:44,679 --> 01:27:47,920
to do he's he's left the place he's at

2324
01:27:46,679 --> 01:27:50,080
he doesn't know what to do so it's time

2325
01:27:47,920 --> 01:27:52,400
to build an altar and make a sacrifice

2326
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:54,280
and figure out and to ask for divine

2327
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:55,960
guidance once again to to figure out

2328
01:27:54,280 --> 01:27:59,239
okay well i' I've done that Been There

2329
01:27:55,960 --> 01:28:00,800
Done That What's Next and I'm the

2330
01:27:59,239 --> 01:28:03,280
question is asked seriously and this is

2331
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:06,840
something to consider if you want to

2332
01:28:03,280 --> 01:28:11,000
know what to do ask seriously and say

2333
01:28:06,840 --> 01:28:13,239
I'm willing to see Abraham sacrifices a

2334
01:28:11,000 --> 01:28:15,280
life to his

2335
01:28:13,239 --> 01:28:17,320
vow well so what do you do well you

2336
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:19,600
don't sacrifice an animal you don't you

2337
01:28:17,320 --> 01:28:21,560
don't make a blood sacrifice you do it

2338
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:25,800
psychologically you say I'm going to

2339
01:28:21,560 --> 01:28:27,159
sacrifice my life to this aim

2340
01:28:25,800 --> 01:28:28,960
that's what you do if you're serious

2341
01:28:27,159 --> 01:28:31,440
what do I do next well I'm going to

2342
01:28:28,960 --> 01:28:32,520
sacrifice my life to this aim what is it

2343
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:35,679
that I should do that's worth

2344
01:28:32,520 --> 01:28:37,600
sacrificing my life to that's a serious

2345
01:28:35,679 --> 01:28:38,840
question well and maybe that's the sort

2346
01:28:37,600 --> 01:28:39,840
of question that people don't ask

2347
01:28:38,840 --> 01:28:42,239
because they're afraid of the

2348
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:44,000
seriousness of the question and the and

2349
01:28:42,239 --> 01:28:45,840
the what the magnitude of the potential

2350
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:47,000
answer do you really want to know what

2351
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:49,719
you should do that would be worth

2352
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:52,119
sacrificing your life to well the answer

2353
01:28:49,719 --> 01:28:54,560
is yes because it's worth it but the

2354
01:28:52,119 --> 01:28:57,440
answer is also no because

2355
01:28:54,560 --> 01:28:59,360
like really it's it's your life you know

2356
01:28:57,440 --> 01:29:02,440
what if you're

2357
01:28:59,360 --> 01:29:04,679
wrong and you're probably

2358
01:29:02,440 --> 01:29:06,280
wrong but maybe that doesn't matter

2359
01:29:04,679 --> 01:29:08,560
maybe it doesn't matter because maybe

2360
01:29:06,280 --> 01:29:11,040
the rightness is in the process and not

2361
01:29:08,560 --> 01:29:12,639
in the and not in the decision right

2362
01:29:11,040 --> 01:29:14,280
because it's not it's the beginning of a

2363
01:29:12,639 --> 01:29:16,520
sequence of decisions as we've already

2364
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:18,159
pointed outto the place of the altar

2365
01:29:16,520 --> 01:29:19,520
which he had made there at the first and

2366
01:29:18,159 --> 01:29:22,719
there Abram called on the name of the

2367
01:29:19,520 --> 01:29:24,840
Lord and lot also and lot also which

2368
01:29:22,719 --> 01:29:26,560
went with Abraham Abra had flocks and

2369
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:28,560
herds and Tents and the land was not

2370
01:29:26,560 --> 01:29:30,040
able to Bear them that they might dwell

2371
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:31,400
together for their substance was great

2372
01:29:30,040 --> 01:29:33,159
so that they could not dwell together

2373
01:29:31,400 --> 01:29:35,960
and there was a Strife between the

2374
01:29:33,159 --> 01:29:37,639
herdmen of Abram's cattle the Cowboys

2375
01:29:35,960 --> 01:29:39,239
and the Herdman of Lot's cattle and the

2376
01:29:37,639 --> 01:29:41,600
Canaanite and the perizzite dwelt then

2377
01:29:39,239 --> 01:29:43,600
in the land well and that's interesting

2378
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:44,880
too because you know Abram's having a

2379
01:29:43,600 --> 01:29:47,960
pretty good time of it now right he's

2380
01:29:44,880 --> 01:29:49,880
out of starvation hey that's good he's

2381
01:29:47,960 --> 01:29:52,719
out of the Tyranny now he's kind of

2382
01:29:49,880 --> 01:29:54,760
wealthy and then the story flips on him

2383
01:29:52,719 --> 01:29:56,320
he's wealthy and now bad thing happens

2384
01:29:54,760 --> 01:29:57,719
to him right and say he's got all this

2385
01:29:56,320 --> 01:29:58,960
wealth and so does his nephew and now

2386
01:29:57,719 --> 01:30:01,360
they can't get along because they have

2387
01:29:58,960 --> 01:30:03,440
too much stuff so that's quite comical

2388
01:30:01,360 --> 01:30:05,760
as well I think that's a comic interlude

2389
01:30:03,440 --> 01:30:08,280
here now they handle it

2390
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:10,000
properly and Abram said unto lot let

2391
01:30:08,280 --> 01:30:11,800
there be no Strife I pray thee between

2392
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:14,280
me and thee and between my Herdman and

2393
01:30:11,800 --> 01:30:16,480
thy Herdman because we're brothers is

2394
01:30:14,280 --> 01:30:18,679
not the whole land before thee separate

2395
01:30:16,480 --> 01:30:20,760
thyself I pray thee from me if you'll

2396
01:30:18,679 --> 01:30:22,800
take the left then I'll take the right

2397
01:30:20,760 --> 01:30:24,520
or if you depart to the right then I'll

2398
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:26,440
go to the left so B basically they sit

2399
01:30:24,520 --> 01:30:28,880
down and say well you know one of us has

2400
01:30:26,440 --> 01:30:30,440
got to get out of town and it can be one

2401
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:32,159
or the other it doesn't really matter we

2402
01:30:30,440 --> 01:30:34,560
can flip a coin or but we have to we

2403
01:30:32,159 --> 01:30:37,840
have to separate and so they they do it

2404
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:39,639
amicably and lot lifted up his eyes and

2405
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:41,400
looked at all of the plain of Jordan

2406
01:30:39,639 --> 01:30:42,960
that it was well watered everywhere so

2407
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:44,440
that's an intimation of Eden right

2408
01:30:42,960 --> 01:30:45,440
because you remember Eden means well

2409
01:30:44,440 --> 01:30:47,960
watered

2410
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:50,520
place before the Lord destroyed Sodom

2411
01:30:47,960 --> 01:30:52,119
and Gomorrah even as the garden of the

2412
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:54,480
Lord like the land of Egypt as thou

2413
01:30:52,119 --> 01:30:57,440
comest unto zor so interesting you get

2414
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:59,520
foreshadowing here again right so lot

2415
01:30:57,440 --> 01:31:02,679
and Abram are making the decision about

2416
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:05,480
where to go and and lot looks out and

2417
01:31:02,679 --> 01:31:07,639
and sees a a reasonable place but then

2418
01:31:05,480 --> 01:31:09,199
this warning comes up that there's a

2419
01:31:07,639 --> 01:31:12,000
there's a city out there there's a place

2420
01:31:09,199 --> 01:31:14,080
out there where things are not going to

2421
01:31:12,000 --> 01:31:17,080
go well things are being done badly and

2422
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:18,520
things are not going to go well then lot

2423
01:31:17,080 --> 01:31:20,239
shows him all the plane of Jordan and

2424
01:31:18,520 --> 01:31:22,800
Lot journeyed East and they separated

2425
01:31:20,239 --> 01:31:24,400
themselves the one from the other Abram

2426
01:31:22,800 --> 01:31:25,719
dwelt in the land of Canaan and then lot

2427
01:31:24,400 --> 01:31:27,400
dwelt in the cities of the plain and

2428
01:31:25,719 --> 01:31:30,600
pitched his tent towards

2429
01:31:27,400 --> 01:31:33,000
Sodom but the men of Sodom were Wicked

2430
01:31:30,600 --> 01:31:34,880
and sinners before the Lord exceedingly

2431
01:31:33,000 --> 01:31:36,719
now the word sin I've mentioned this to

2432
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:38,679
you before I think it's an interesting

2433
01:31:36,719 --> 01:31:40,880
word it's it's the derivation of an

2434
01:31:38,679 --> 01:31:43,560
archery term in my understanding of its

2435
01:31:40,880 --> 01:31:45,560
derivation it it the Greek word was

2436
01:31:43,560 --> 01:31:49,040
hamartia and hamartia is an archery term

2437
01:31:45,560 --> 01:31:50,679
which means to to miss the bullsi and

2438
01:31:49,040 --> 01:31:52,239
you think it's worth thinking about that

2439
01:31:50,679 --> 01:31:53,360
metaphorically because you got to think

2440
01:31:52,239 --> 01:31:54,960
about all the ways that you could miss

2441
01:31:53,360 --> 01:31:57,600
the bullseye right you could close your

2442
01:31:54,960 --> 01:31:59,600
eyes that's very common you could just

2443
01:31:57,600 --> 01:32:02,480
not lift up the damn bow and arrow to

2444
01:31:59,600 --> 01:32:05,600
begin with you could face the wrong way

2445
01:32:02,480 --> 01:32:07,840
you could be unskilled in your aim but I

2446
01:32:05,600 --> 01:32:09,880
and I also like the the the archery

2447
01:32:07,840 --> 01:32:12,000
metaphor because human beings are built

2448
01:32:09,880 --> 01:32:13,639
on a hunting platform right and we

2449
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:15,719
always aim at things we're we're things

2450
01:32:13,639 --> 01:32:17,880
that we're we're ballistic creatures on

2451
01:32:15,719 --> 01:32:19,159
a trajectory always and we're always

2452
01:32:17,880 --> 01:32:20,880
aiming at something we're always aiming

2453
01:32:19,159 --> 01:32:22,239
at the Mark and which is of course what

2454
01:32:20,880 --> 01:32:24,199
you do when you hunt right because you

2455
01:32:22,239 --> 01:32:26,080
have to hit the mark precisely and

2456
01:32:24,199 --> 01:32:27,719
that's what we're like and so but we're

2457
01:32:26,080 --> 01:32:30,040
like that psychologically we have to aim

2458
01:32:27,719 --> 01:32:32,960
at something and then move towards it

2459
01:32:30,040 --> 01:32:36,639
and and so to sin is to miss the Mark is

2460
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:38,280
to is to miss the bullseye to to fail to

2461
01:32:36,639 --> 01:32:41,560
take aim to aim

2462
01:32:38,280 --> 01:32:45,520
badly to aim carelessly or to not aim at

2463
01:32:41,560 --> 01:32:48,000
all and that says well

2464
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:49,760
that's that's like a sin of a mission

2465
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:51,760
that's to not do and then to be Wicked

2466
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:54,880
is to aim at what you know you shouldn't

2467
01:32:51,760 --> 01:32:56,600
aim at and again I don't I don't think

2468
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:58,760
of that as an external morality

2469
01:32:56,600 --> 01:33:00,880
precisely I think that you can read the

2470
01:32:58,760 --> 01:33:03,639
entire biblical narrative again from a

2471
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:05,719
psychological perspective and say we're

2472
01:33:03,639 --> 01:33:08,960
not talking about external codes of

2473
01:33:05,719 --> 01:33:12,199
conduct here although we could we're not

2474
01:33:08,960 --> 01:33:14,000
the wickedness that's being described is

2475
01:33:12,199 --> 01:33:17,480
the act of you doing something that you

2476
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:18,639
know to be wrong period you know and you

2477
01:33:17,480 --> 01:33:19,800
may do something you don't know if it's

2478
01:33:18,639 --> 01:33:21,199
wrong or not that isn't the sort of

2479
01:33:19,800 --> 01:33:22,600
thing that we're talking about and we're

2480
01:33:21,199 --> 01:33:25,000
not talking about the things that you do

2481
01:33:22,600 --> 01:33:26,360
that are right are that other people

2482
01:33:25,000 --> 01:33:28,320
think are wrong we're not talking about

2483
01:33:26,360 --> 01:33:30,000
those either we're talking about those

2484
01:33:28,320 --> 01:33:32,920
things that you consciously do although

2485
01:33:30,000 --> 01:33:34,199
you know them to be wrong yourself and

2486
01:33:32,920 --> 01:33:35,800
that's the things that seem to get

2487
01:33:34,199 --> 01:33:37,639
people into the most trouble in these

2488
01:33:35,800 --> 01:33:39,320
stories and I I believe that to be the

2489
01:33:37,639 --> 01:33:41,840
case I think that's very accurate

2490
01:33:39,320 --> 01:33:43,639
psychologically it's amazing because I

2491
01:33:41,840 --> 01:33:45,480
see this all the time if you do

2492
01:33:43,639 --> 01:33:47,560
something wrong and it's because you're

2493
01:33:45,480 --> 01:33:50,400
ignorant you don't know better it it

2494
01:33:47,560 --> 01:33:51,840
doesn't go well for you that's the case

2495
01:33:50,400 --> 01:33:54,000
but if you do something wrong and you

2496
01:33:51,840 --> 01:33:56,440
know it's wrong

2497
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:57,760
the punishment is is manifold and I

2498
01:33:56,440 --> 01:33:59,400
think the reason for that I think the

2499
01:33:57,760 --> 01:34:01,880
reason for that is because that makes

2500
01:33:59,400 --> 01:34:04,360
you can it means you betray your own

2501
01:34:01,880 --> 01:34:05,920
ideal right if you just don't know well

2502
01:34:04,360 --> 01:34:07,960
you haven't betrayed your ideal you're

2503
01:34:05,920 --> 01:34:10,040
just not together maybe you're even

2504
01:34:07,960 --> 01:34:11,159
willfully blind but if you do something

2505
01:34:10,040 --> 01:34:13,000
you know to be wrong then you've

2506
01:34:11,159 --> 01:34:15,679
betrayed your own ideal and that lands

2507
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:19,440
you Cain says to God once Cain destroys

2508
01:34:15,679 --> 01:34:19,440
Abel he says I cannot Bear My

2509
01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:26,440
Punishment and the Lord said unto to

2510
01:34:23,800 --> 01:34:28,239
Abram after that lot was separated from

2511
01:34:26,440 --> 01:34:31,440
lift up now thine

2512
01:34:28,239 --> 01:34:33,040
eyes look upward and look from the place

2513
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:34,840
where thou are northward and Southward

2514
01:34:33,040 --> 01:34:36,960
and Eastward and Westward for all the

2515
01:34:34,840 --> 01:34:39,840
land which thou seest to thee I will

2516
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:41,239
give it and to thy seed forever and I

2517
01:34:39,840 --> 01:34:42,840
will make thy seed as the dust of the

2518
01:34:41,239 --> 01:34:44,840
earth so that if a man can number the

2519
01:34:42,840 --> 01:34:48,159
dust of the earth then shall all thy

2520
01:34:44,840 --> 01:34:49,639
seed be numbered arise walk through the

2521
01:34:48,159 --> 01:34:53,840
land in the length of it and the breadth

2522
01:34:49,639 --> 01:34:53,840
of it for I will give it unto thee

2523
01:34:56,639 --> 01:35:05,159
in the C Cathedral at chart I can't say

2524
01:35:01,080 --> 01:35:05,159
that properly because by French is

2525
01:35:05,400 --> 01:35:10,719
non-existent so a cathedral is a cross

2526
01:35:08,199 --> 01:35:13,360
and the transformation takes place at

2527
01:35:10,719 --> 01:35:15,159
the Crux of the Cross which is exactly

2528
01:35:13,360 --> 01:35:17,199
right because the the transformation

2529
01:35:15,159 --> 01:35:19,480
takes place at the point of maximal

2530
01:35:17,199 --> 01:35:25,119
suffering and the cathedral is designed

2531
01:35:19,480 --> 01:35:25,119
to indicate that right symbolically now

2532
01:35:27,480 --> 01:35:32,000
what happens in a religious ceremony is

2533
01:35:29,400 --> 01:35:34,320
also a journey and it's a journey in

2534
01:35:32,000 --> 01:35:35,679
some sense to the holy city and then

2535
01:35:34,320 --> 01:35:37,159
that's also played out in the idea of

2536
01:35:35,679 --> 01:35:39,320
pilgrimage right because you go to the

2537
01:35:37,159 --> 01:35:40,960
holy city actually you go to Jerusalem

2538
01:35:39,320 --> 01:35:43,119
or wherever it is that you think the

2539
01:35:40,960 --> 01:35:44,600
holy city is you go there and that takes

2540
01:35:43,119 --> 01:35:46,960
you out of your country and away from

2541
01:35:44,600 --> 01:35:49,280
your kin and away from your family into

2542
01:35:46,960 --> 01:35:51,080
the Strange Land and as you make the

2543
01:35:49,280 --> 01:35:52,920
journey you transform and when you come

2544
01:35:51,080 --> 01:35:55,080
back you're not the same That's The

2545
01:35:52,920 --> 01:35:57,199
Hobbit right that's the story of The

2546
01:35:55,080 --> 01:35:59,639
Hobbit but let's say you can't afford to

2547
01:35:57,199 --> 01:36:01,080
go on a pilgrimage so you go to the

2548
01:35:59,639 --> 01:36:04,679
Cathedral at chart and there's a huge

2549
01:36:01,080 --> 01:36:07,080
maze on the ground and it's the world

2550
01:36:04,679 --> 01:36:11,119
North West South and East just as God

2551
01:36:07,080 --> 01:36:13,639
describes here so it's laid out and you

2552
01:36:11,119 --> 01:36:16,719
enter the maze at one side and in the

2553
01:36:13,639 --> 01:36:17,520
middle is a stone pattern that looks

2554
01:36:16,719 --> 01:36:20,480
like a

2555
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:22,440
flower and it's it's the place where

2556
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:24,920
being Wells forth and it's at the center

2557
01:36:22,440 --> 01:36:26,239
of the cathedral

2558
01:36:24,920 --> 01:36:28,119
and what that means is that if you

2559
01:36:26,239 --> 01:36:30,040
accept your suffering then you move to

2560
01:36:28,119 --> 01:36:32,600
the place where the spirit of being

2561
01:36:30,040 --> 01:36:34,280
Wells forth that's what that means and

2562
01:36:32,600 --> 01:36:37,679
so you enter

2563
01:36:34,280 --> 01:36:39,040
the the Maze and you walk and it's

2564
01:36:37,679 --> 01:36:41,440
divided into

2565
01:36:39,040 --> 01:36:43,400
quadrants and you walk one quadrant

2566
01:36:41,440 --> 01:36:44,960
completely and then the maze pathway

2567
01:36:43,400 --> 01:36:46,639
takes you into the next quadrant and you

2568
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:48,400
walk that completely and then it takes

2569
01:36:46,639 --> 01:36:50,159
you to the third one and the fourth one

2570
01:36:48,400 --> 01:36:52,440
and then when you walk the maze

2571
01:36:50,159 --> 01:36:54,679
completely everywhere when you've gone

2572
01:36:52,440 --> 01:36:56,440
everywhere in the world north south east

2573
01:36:54,679 --> 01:36:59,880
and west where you've when you've

2574
01:36:56,440 --> 01:37:01,800
traversed the territory completely then

2575
01:36:59,880 --> 01:37:04,800
you come to the center and then it's

2576
01:37:01,800 --> 01:37:06,760
yours and that's what this is so I've

2577
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:08,719
noticed when I've been renovating houses

2578
01:37:06,760 --> 01:37:11,600
I like to do that I paid a lot of

2579
01:37:08,719 --> 01:37:12,880
attention to the psychological process

2580
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:16,280
of house

2581
01:37:12,880 --> 01:37:19,080
renovation because I learned from Yung

2582
01:37:16,280 --> 01:37:20,920
that Yung said this this is something

2583
01:37:19,080 --> 01:37:23,000
man he said because he was he was

2584
01:37:20,920 --> 01:37:24,800
talking about the stages of integration

2585
01:37:23,000 --> 01:37:28,239
psychological IC integration and he

2586
01:37:24,800 --> 01:37:32,239
looked beyond P I would say um although

2587
01:37:28,239 --> 01:37:34,440
P looked very far he said here here's a

2588
01:37:32,239 --> 01:37:36,159
conjunction you have to get your

2589
01:37:34,440 --> 01:37:37,880
rationality and your emotion together

2590
01:37:36,159 --> 01:37:40,560
that's a male female conjunction

2591
01:37:37,880 --> 01:37:42,000
symbolically speaking male rationality

2592
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:43,760
female emotionality you want to bring

2593
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:45,800
those together so that they're oriented

2594
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:48,000
in the same direction your emotions and

2595
01:37:45,800 --> 01:37:49,639
your rationality serve the same purpose

2596
01:37:48,000 --> 01:37:51,400
so then you're unified in Mind and

2597
01:37:49,639 --> 01:37:53,560
Spirit let's say but that's not good

2598
01:37:51,400 --> 01:37:55,760
enough once you've got that together

2599
01:37:53,560 --> 01:37:58,159
then there's a you have a body and then

2600
01:37:55,760 --> 01:38:01,159
that's a male female conjunction again a

2601
01:37:58,159 --> 01:38:03,400
Divine conjunction the recreation of

2602
01:38:01,159 --> 01:38:05,880
Adam before his division into female and

2603
01:38:03,400 --> 01:38:08,080
male and the Reconstruction of the

2604
01:38:05,880 --> 01:38:10,719
androgynous Christ that all that all

2605
01:38:08,080 --> 01:38:12,400
those ideas are linked together so now

2606
01:38:10,719 --> 01:38:14,800
you have your emotion and your

2607
01:38:12,400 --> 01:38:16,280
rationality moving in the same direction

2608
01:38:14,800 --> 01:38:19,440
but you're not acting it

2609
01:38:16,280 --> 01:38:21,639
out so now you have to unite that

2610
01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:25,199
abstract part of you with your body and

2611
01:38:21,639 --> 01:38:26,719
start acting out what you think can feel

2612
01:38:25,199 --> 01:38:29,119
and that's the next conjunction but it's

2613
01:38:26,719 --> 01:38:31,040
not the last one the last conjunction is

2614
01:38:29,119 --> 01:38:33,480
when you realize that there is no

2615
01:38:31,040 --> 01:38:36,360
distinction between you and your

2616
01:38:33,480 --> 01:38:37,719
experience they're the same thing and so

2617
01:38:36,360 --> 01:38:40,599
then when you put together your house

2618
01:38:37,719 --> 01:38:40,599
you're putting together

2619
01:38:40,679 --> 01:38:45,520
yourself so I've noticed in when I've

2620
01:38:43,159 --> 01:38:47,800
lived in places rented or owned didn't

2621
01:38:45,520 --> 01:38:49,360
matter that if there were part of the

2622
01:38:47,800 --> 01:38:52,199
place if there was a part of the place

2623
01:38:49,360 --> 01:38:54,360
that I hadn't attended to whatever that

2624
01:38:52,199 --> 01:38:55,760
might mean it might meant clean

2625
01:38:54,360 --> 01:38:57,960
it might have meant fixed but it

2626
01:38:55,760 --> 01:39:00,440
certainly meant at least thoroughly

2627
01:38:57,960 --> 01:39:02,760
investigated then that was chaos it was

2628
01:39:00,440 --> 01:39:04,040
like it was it was like the desert that

2629
01:39:02,760 --> 01:39:05,719
part that's that's a way of thinking

2630
01:39:04,040 --> 01:39:07,880
about it it wasn't mine even if I owned

2631
01:39:05,719 --> 01:39:10,040
it wasn't mine I had to interact with it

2632
01:39:07,880 --> 01:39:11,520
before it became mine and I had to

2633
01:39:10,040 --> 01:39:14,480
interact with it and I had to put it in

2634
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:16,080
order and then it became mine and then

2635
01:39:14,480 --> 01:39:17,840
and then to the degree that it became

2636
01:39:16,080 --> 01:39:20,440
mine and was in order then I was also

2637
01:39:17,840 --> 01:39:22,199
put in order now you know that because

2638
01:39:20,440 --> 01:39:24,119
you go into places that make you

2639
01:39:22,199 --> 01:39:27,000
uncomfortable and maybe it's your own

2640
01:39:24,119 --> 01:39:29,239
house it's highly probable it's highly

2641
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:30,920
probable I you know I walk into well

2642
01:39:29,239 --> 01:39:32,400
Chinese doctors do this traditional

2643
01:39:30,920 --> 01:39:34,400
Chinese doctors they go into place

2644
01:39:32,400 --> 01:39:36,520
people's place and they they diagnose

2645
01:39:34,400 --> 01:39:39,880
their health conditions on the on the

2646
01:39:36,520 --> 01:39:41,480
balance of Yin and Yang Chaos and Order

2647
01:39:39,880 --> 01:39:43,280
they walk into a house this is easy to

2648
01:39:41,480 --> 01:39:45,599
do you walk into a house there's too

2649
01:39:43,280 --> 01:39:48,520
much chaos hey you can detect that in no

2650
01:39:45,599 --> 01:39:50,239
time flat everything is out of order and

2651
01:39:48,520 --> 01:39:51,520
chaotic you don't even want to be there

2652
01:39:50,239 --> 01:39:53,840
you certainly don't want to open the

2653
01:39:51,520 --> 01:39:55,280
refrigerator that's for sure and there

2654
01:39:53,840 --> 01:39:57,440
are things that should have been done

2655
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:59,000
years ago everywhere and every one of

2656
01:39:57,440 --> 01:40:00,599
those things is a fight that hasn't

2657
01:39:59,000 --> 01:40:02,639
happened and something that's been

2658
01:40:00,599 --> 01:40:04,119
avoided and you can't even walk in there

2659
01:40:02,639 --> 01:40:05,599
and maintain your health as soon as you

2660
01:40:04,119 --> 01:40:07,560
walk in there you're sicker than you

2661
01:40:05,599 --> 01:40:09,119
were when you were outside and that's

2662
01:40:07,560 --> 01:40:12,080
one sort of place and then another sort

2663
01:40:09,119 --> 01:40:15,520
of place is you go in you look at the

2664
01:40:12,080 --> 01:40:19,239
living room and the person has vacuumed

2665
01:40:15,520 --> 01:40:21,760
the living room rug and the lines that

2666
01:40:19,239 --> 01:40:24,119
were vacuumed are parallel to one

2667
01:40:21,760 --> 01:40:26,480
another and the and the furniture is

2668
01:40:24,119 --> 01:40:27,920
covered with plastic and you get a glass

2669
01:40:26,480 --> 01:40:29,719
of water and then just as you're going

2670
01:40:27,920 --> 01:40:31,400
to set it down on the coffee table the

2671
01:40:29,719 --> 01:40:33,320
person rushes over and puts a coaster

2672
01:40:31,400 --> 01:40:35,679
underneath it and everything in that

2673
01:40:33,320 --> 01:40:37,639
house says to you that it would be a lot

2674
01:40:35,679 --> 01:40:40,719
more perfect in that house if you were

2675
01:40:37,639 --> 01:40:42,280
either not there or dead and that's the

2676
01:40:40,719 --> 01:40:44,480
and that's the message that the whole

2677
01:40:42,280 --> 01:40:45,840
house is blasting at you and if you

2678
01:40:44,480 --> 01:40:48,159
happen to live there then you're going

2679
01:40:45,840 --> 01:40:50,960
to be sick and what you're going to be

2680
01:40:48,159 --> 01:40:52,360
sick from is too much order and in the

2681
01:40:50,960 --> 01:40:54,199
other house you're going to be sick from

2682
01:40:52,360 --> 01:40:59,119
too much chaos

2683
01:40:54,199 --> 01:41:02,199
and so when you interact with a

2684
01:40:59,119 --> 01:41:04,040
house the unexplored parts are the chaos

2685
01:41:02,199 --> 01:41:07,119
that have the parts that you have not

2686
01:41:04,040 --> 01:41:09,480
yet contended with are the chaos that is

2687
01:41:07,119 --> 01:41:12,840
not yet been transformed by your

2688
01:41:09,480 --> 01:41:15,960
embodied logos action into habitable

2689
01:41:12,840 --> 01:41:18,520
territory and it does not belong to

2690
01:41:15,960 --> 01:41:20,040
you arise walk through the land in the

2691
01:41:18,520 --> 01:41:22,159
length of it and the breadth of it for I

2692
01:41:20,040 --> 01:41:23,800
will give it unto thee then Abram

2693
01:41:22,159 --> 01:41:26,280
removed his tent and came dwelt in the

2694
01:41:23,800 --> 01:41:28,679
plain of mamra which is in heon and

2695
01:41:26,280 --> 01:41:31,960
built there an altar unto the

2696
01:41:28,679 --> 01:41:36,119
Lord and it came to pass in the days of

2697
01:41:31,960 --> 01:41:38,480
amrel king of shanar arok king of alisar

2698
01:41:36,119 --> 01:41:40,199
chalomar there's a lot of Kings we won't

2699
01:41:38,480 --> 01:41:42,000
talk about them these made war with

2700
01:41:40,199 --> 01:41:45,040
barah king of Sodom and with Bersa king

2701
01:41:42,000 --> 01:41:47,560
of Gomorrah shab king of adma and the

2702
01:41:45,040 --> 01:41:48,840
king of Bella which is zor and these

2703
01:41:47,560 --> 01:41:51,679
were joined together in the veil of

2704
01:41:48,840 --> 01:41:54,199
sidom which is the salt

2705
01:41:51,679 --> 01:41:58,000
sea now this is actually very much

2706
01:41:54,199 --> 01:42:00,719
relevant hey because you see the veil of

2707
01:41:58,000 --> 01:42:03,159
sedom which is the salt sea is the

2708
01:42:00,719 --> 01:42:05,639
farthest South you can go if South is

2709
01:42:03,159 --> 01:42:07,400
down because it's the Dead Sea and the

2710
01:42:05,639 --> 01:42:10,360
Dead Sea is the lowest place that there

2711
01:42:07,400 --> 01:42:12,760
is so what's happened is that there's

2712
01:42:10,360 --> 01:42:14,520
chaos in the lowest place that there is

2713
01:42:12,760 --> 01:42:16,560
that's what this story says and what

2714
01:42:14,520 --> 01:42:18,639
happens to lot is he gets Tangled Up in

2715
01:42:16,560 --> 01:42:21,639
the chaos of the lowest place that there

2716
01:42:18,639 --> 01:42:21,639
is

2717
01:42:25,119 --> 01:42:28,560
and in the 14th year came chador Lor and

2718
01:42:27,280 --> 01:42:32,199
the kings that were with him and smote

2719
01:42:28,560 --> 01:42:35,199
the Reames and astroth kame and the zims

2720
01:42:32,199 --> 01:42:37,040
in ham and the emmans in Shava K katham

2721
01:42:35,199 --> 01:42:39,280
and the horites in their Mount sire unto

2722
01:42:37,040 --> 01:42:41,199
elperin which is by the Wilderness and

2723
01:42:39,280 --> 01:42:42,880
they returned and came to en mishpat

2724
01:42:41,199 --> 01:42:44,560
which is cadesh and smote all the

2725
01:42:42,880 --> 01:42:47,159
country the

2726
01:42:44,560 --> 01:42:49,960
amalekites amalekites and the amorites

2727
01:42:47,159 --> 01:42:49,960
that dwelt in

2728
01:42:51,280 --> 01:42:56,880
he hes

2729
01:42:54,639 --> 01:42:58,400
haaz zontar there we go perhaps and

2730
01:42:56,880 --> 01:43:00,159
there went out the king of Sodom and the

2731
01:42:58,400 --> 01:43:01,639
king of Gomorrah and the king of adma

2732
01:43:00,159 --> 01:43:03,760
and the king of zbam and the king of

2733
01:43:01,639 --> 01:43:05,480
Bella the same is zor and they joined

2734
01:43:03,760 --> 01:43:09,280
battle with them in the veil of sidm so

2735
01:43:05,480 --> 01:43:13,119
this is absolute chaos and Mayhem in the

2736
01:43:09,280 --> 01:43:13,119
lowest place it's hell

2737
01:43:13,400 --> 01:43:17,440
essentially with chedore the king of

2738
01:43:15,599 --> 01:43:19,480
alam and with tidal king of Nations and

2739
01:43:17,440 --> 01:43:21,880
amrel king of shanar and arot king of

2740
01:43:19,480 --> 01:43:24,480
elazar Four Kings with five and the veil

2741
01:43:21,880 --> 01:43:26,840
of sidm was full of slim pits low and

2742
01:43:24,480 --> 01:43:29,040
hell likee with war isn't enough they

2743
01:43:26,840 --> 01:43:30,760
had to throw the Slime pits in there

2744
01:43:29,040 --> 01:43:33,320
apparently around the Dead Sea there are

2745
01:43:30,760 --> 01:43:36,080
pits of bite bit bitumen like the like

2746
01:43:33,320 --> 01:43:37,440
the tar pits in near La and so this

2747
01:43:36,080 --> 01:43:39,159
seems to actually be historically

2748
01:43:37,440 --> 01:43:40,880
accurate and the kings of Sodom and

2749
01:43:39,159 --> 01:43:42,159
Gomorrah fled and fell there and they

2750
01:43:40,880 --> 01:43:43,840
that remained fled to the mountain and

2751
01:43:42,159 --> 01:43:45,239
they took their goods and they took all

2752
01:43:43,840 --> 01:43:47,560
the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah and all

2753
01:43:45,239 --> 01:43:49,880
their victuals and went their way and

2754
01:43:47,560 --> 01:43:51,360
they took lot Abram's brother's son who

2755
01:43:49,880 --> 01:43:53,599
dwelt in Sodom and his goods and

2756
01:43:51,360 --> 01:43:56,599
departed so Abram has a family member

2757
01:43:53,599 --> 01:43:58,119
who falls into the lowest place and

2758
01:43:56,599 --> 01:44:00,040
there came one that had escaped and told

2759
01:43:58,119 --> 01:44:01,800
Abram the Hebrew for he dwelt in the

2760
01:44:00,040 --> 01:44:03,840
plain of mam the Amorite brother of

2761
01:44:01,800 --> 01:44:05,840
ishol and brother of Anor and these were

2762
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:07,639
Confederate with Abram and when Abram

2763
01:44:05,840 --> 01:44:09,520
heard that his brother was taken captive

2764
01:44:07,639 --> 01:44:12,400
he armed his trained servants born in

2765
01:44:09,520 --> 01:44:14,080
his own house 318 and pursued them unto

2766
01:44:12,400 --> 01:44:15,760
Dan well so now we also know that

2767
01:44:14,080 --> 01:44:18,360
Abraham is a pretty brave guy right he

2768
01:44:15,760 --> 01:44:20,520
gets word that this horrible War has

2769
01:44:18,360 --> 01:44:22,880
broken out in the worst of all possible

2770
01:44:20,520 --> 01:44:24,639
places and that his nephew is involved

2771
01:44:22,880 --> 01:44:27,400
and the first thing he does is you know

2772
01:44:24,639 --> 01:44:29,960
Mount up his posy and get the hell in

2773
01:44:27,400 --> 01:44:32,599
there and rescue his nephew so Abraham's

2774
01:44:29,960 --> 01:44:34,679
no whatever goodness is from the Old

2775
01:44:32,599 --> 01:44:37,239
Testament perspective it isn't

2776
01:44:34,679 --> 01:44:39,960
harmlessness right it isn't emasculation

2777
01:44:37,239 --> 01:44:42,560
and castration it's not that it's not

2778
01:44:39,960 --> 01:44:44,920
weakness it's not the inability to fight

2779
01:44:42,560 --> 01:44:46,520
none of that is associated with virtue

2780
01:44:44,920 --> 01:44:48,440
it's the sort of strength that enables

2781
01:44:46,520 --> 01:44:50,440
someone to mount and armed team of 300

2782
01:44:48,440 --> 01:44:53,040
people when he finds out that his nephew

2783
01:44:50,440 --> 01:44:54,960
is being kidnapped in a terrible war and

2784
01:44:53,040 --> 01:44:58,280
to get the hell out there and take him

2785
01:44:54,960 --> 01:45:02,320
back and so that's a that's a that's a

2786
01:44:58,280 --> 01:45:06,280
that's a call to to it's a call to power

2787
01:45:02,320 --> 01:45:07,840
that not not a kind of peaceful meekness

2788
01:45:06,280 --> 01:45:09,679
that's funny too because you know

2789
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:11,480
there's a line in the New Testament the

2790
01:45:09,679 --> 01:45:13,560
meek shall inherit the earth I got to

2791
01:45:11,480 --> 01:45:15,320
look at my phone for a sec here because

2792
01:45:13,560 --> 01:45:16,880
I don't know what time it is there's a

2793
01:45:15,320 --> 01:45:18,360
line in the New Testament that says and

2794
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:20,560
send The Sermon on the Mount says the

2795
01:45:18,360 --> 01:45:22,080
meek shall inherit the earth and that I

2796
01:45:20,560 --> 01:45:24,560
that line always bothered me I thought

2797
01:45:22,080 --> 01:45:27,280
no way that's not that that's not right

2798
01:45:24,560 --> 01:45:30,080
Meek can't be the right word so when I

2799
01:45:27,280 --> 01:45:31,760
was doing the story of Noah and talking

2800
01:45:30,080 --> 01:45:33,520
about The Sermon on the Mount I spent a

2801
01:45:31,760 --> 01:45:35,960
bunch of time looking at commentaries on

2802
01:45:33,520 --> 01:45:37,440
that line looking at the roots the you

2803
01:45:35,960 --> 01:45:38,679
know the Greek roots and the Hebrew

2804
01:45:37,440 --> 01:45:42,159
roots and trying to figure out what that

2805
01:45:38,679 --> 01:45:45,280
meant and It Meek does not mean Meek

2806
01:45:42,159 --> 01:45:46,960
that's wrong here's what it means those

2807
01:45:45,280 --> 01:45:49,560
who have weapons and know how to use

2808
01:45:46,960 --> 01:45:52,679
them but still keep them sheathed will

2809
01:45:49,560 --> 01:45:56,599
inherit the earth Jesus that's a lot

2810
01:45:52,679 --> 01:45:58,760
different man it's a lot better right

2811
01:45:56,599 --> 01:46:01,800
because the way it's normally it's

2812
01:45:58,760 --> 01:46:03,320
normally interpreted is if you're so

2813
01:46:01,800 --> 01:46:05,800
weak that you're harmless then things

2814
01:46:03,320 --> 01:46:08,000
will go well for you it's like no that's

2815
01:46:05,800 --> 01:46:09,480
not right that's that's not that can't

2816
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:10,880
be right it doesn't fit with the

2817
01:46:09,480 --> 01:46:13,639
narrative it certainly doesn't fit with

2818
01:46:10,880 --> 01:46:15,119
this narrative and he divided himself

2819
01:46:13,639 --> 01:46:17,440
against them he and his servants by

2820
01:46:15,119 --> 01:46:19,080
night and smot them and pursued them

2821
01:46:17,440 --> 01:46:20,520
onto hobah which is on the left side of

2822
01:46:19,080 --> 01:46:23,280
Damascus and he brought back all the

2823
01:46:20,520 --> 01:46:26,360
goods and his brother lot and and his

2824
01:46:23,280 --> 01:46:29,280
goods and the women also and the people

2825
01:46:26,360 --> 01:46:30,960
good work Abraham and the kings of Sodom

2826
01:46:29,280 --> 01:46:34,080
went out to meet him after his return at

2827
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:35,639
the slaughter of chalomar and of the

2828
01:46:34,080 --> 01:46:37,199
kings that there were there with him at

2829
01:46:35,639 --> 01:46:39,320
the valley of Shiva which is the King's

2830
01:46:37,199 --> 01:46:40,800
Dale and melch as a king of Salem

2831
01:46:39,320 --> 01:46:43,040
brought forth Bread and

2832
01:46:40,800 --> 01:46:44,520
Wine and he was the priest of the most

2833
01:46:43,040 --> 01:46:46,480
high God and he blessed him and said

2834
01:46:44,520 --> 01:46:48,199
Blessed Be Abram of the most high god

2835
01:46:46,480 --> 01:46:49,880
possessor of Heaven and Earth and

2836
01:46:48,199 --> 01:46:51,960
blessed be the most high God which has

2837
01:46:49,880 --> 01:46:54,960
delivered thine enemies into thine hand

2838
01:46:51,960 --> 01:46:56,480
and gave him TI of all and the king of

2839
01:46:54,960 --> 01:46:58,599
Sodom said to Abraham give me the

2840
01:46:56,480 --> 01:47:00,719
persons and take thy Goods to

2841
01:46:58,599 --> 01:47:03,080
thyself this that that were the goods

2842
01:47:00,719 --> 01:47:05,080
that Abram that Abram rescued right of

2843
01:47:03,080 --> 01:47:07,440
the of the Kings and Abram said to the

2844
01:47:05,080 --> 01:47:10,000
king of Sodom I have lift up mine hand

2845
01:47:07,440 --> 01:47:11,880
unto the Lord what is that mean it means

2846
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:13,400
I've made a vow that's what it means

2847
01:47:11,880 --> 01:47:15,119
that that's what that phrase means I've

2848
01:47:13,400 --> 01:47:17,679
made a vow to God the possessor of

2849
01:47:15,119 --> 01:47:19,960
Heaven and Earth that I will not take

2850
01:47:17,679 --> 01:47:22,119
anything from a thread even to a

2851
01:47:19,960 --> 01:47:25,000
shoelace I won't take anything that's

2852
01:47:22,119 --> 01:47:28,040
yours lest you should say I've made

2853
01:47:25,000 --> 01:47:30,520
Abram Rich I'll take only that which my

2854
01:47:28,040 --> 01:47:32,440
young men have eaten and the portion of

2855
01:47:30,520 --> 01:47:35,000
men that went with me and Anor eshkol

2856
01:47:32,440 --> 01:47:38,599
and mam let them take their portion and

2857
01:47:35,000 --> 01:47:40,119
so Abraham decides here he's he's made

2858
01:47:38,599 --> 01:47:42,480
this immense

2859
01:47:40,119 --> 01:47:44,560
sacrifice and done this incredibly Brave

2860
01:47:42,480 --> 01:47:46,960
act and rescued his nephew and rescued

2861
01:47:44,560 --> 01:47:49,280
the king's goods and and they offer him

2862
01:47:46,960 --> 01:47:51,080
a reward and he says I'm not going to

2863
01:47:49,280 --> 01:47:53,920
take the reward and the reason for that

2864
01:47:51,080 --> 01:47:56,960
is that he doesn't want to contaminate

2865
01:47:53,920 --> 01:47:59,800
the the the ethical purity of his

2866
01:47:56,960 --> 01:48:02,280
actions he doesn't want to be paid he

2867
01:47:59,800 --> 01:48:05,040
doesn't want it he doesn't want to

2868
01:48:02,280 --> 01:48:06,440
benefit from doing he doesn't want to

2869
01:48:05,040 --> 01:48:08,320
what is it exactly he doesn't want to

2870
01:48:06,440 --> 01:48:10,840
benefit inappropriately from doing the

2871
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:12,280
right thing it's something like that and

2872
01:48:10,840 --> 01:48:14,040
so it's another Testament to his

2873
01:48:12,280 --> 01:48:16,599
character and a very complex Testament

2874
01:48:14,040 --> 01:48:18,599
right because he's not a s he's not a

2875
01:48:16,599 --> 01:48:20,560
good man in any simple sense I mean look

2876
01:48:18,599 --> 01:48:24,520
what's just happened he's he's mounted

2877
01:48:20,560 --> 01:48:27,800
an armed he's mounted an armed

2878
01:48:24,520 --> 01:48:30,719
uh he's he's LED an army into battle and

2879
01:48:27,800 --> 01:48:33,480
and part and and participated in a

2880
01:48:30,719 --> 01:48:35,599
Slaughter he refuses to benefit from it

2881
01:48:33,480 --> 01:48:38,960
except to get back what was his that's

2882
01:48:35,599 --> 01:48:41,360
it he refuses to benefit from it except

2883
01:48:38,960 --> 01:48:43,159
to get back what was rightfully his and

2884
01:48:41,360 --> 01:48:45,119
in that way he maintains his Covenant

2885
01:48:43,159 --> 01:48:48,840
with

2886
01:48:45,119 --> 01:48:50,679
God even to a Sho latch at I anything

2887
01:48:48,840 --> 01:48:52,239
though never so small or me lest thou

2888
01:48:50,679 --> 01:48:55,360
should claim a share with God in the

2889
01:48:52,239 --> 01:48:56,719
honor Duty him this is from Matthew P

2890
01:48:55,360 --> 01:48:58,639
who is an English non-conformist

2891
01:48:56,719 --> 01:49:00,760
Theologian commenting on that line even

2892
01:48:58,639 --> 01:49:02,880
to a Sho latchet I.E anything though

2893
01:49:00,760 --> 01:49:04,639
never so mean or small lest thou should

2894
01:49:02,880 --> 01:49:06,920
claim a share with God in the honor due

2895
01:49:04,639 --> 01:49:09,480
to him to whose blessing alone I do and

2896
01:49:06,920 --> 01:49:11,719
I will owe my riches or lest thou should

2897
01:49:09,480 --> 01:49:13,440
say Abram is enriched with my spoils and

2898
01:49:11,719 --> 01:49:15,440
however he pretended kindness and

2899
01:49:13,440 --> 01:49:18,480
charity yet indeed it was his

2900
01:49:15,440 --> 01:49:20,800
covetousness that put him upon this

2901
01:49:18,480 --> 01:49:22,719
work after these things the word of the

2902
01:49:20,800 --> 01:49:25,239
Lord came unto Abram in a vision saying

2903
01:49:22,719 --> 01:49:27,840
saying fear not Abram I'm thy shield and

2904
01:49:25,239 --> 01:49:31,570
thy exceedingly and thy exceeding great

2905
01:49:27,840 --> 01:49:32,920
reward the vision issue

2906
01:49:31,570 --> 01:49:37,119
[Music]

2907
01:49:32,920 --> 01:49:37,119
again while we went through that last

2908
01:49:37,679 --> 01:49:41,679
week fear not Abram I am thy shield and

2909
01:49:40,119 --> 01:49:44,880
thy exceeding great reward and Abram

2910
01:49:41,679 --> 01:49:47,800
said Lord God what can you give me

2911
01:49:44,880 --> 01:49:49,080
seeing as I'm childless childless and

2912
01:49:47,800 --> 01:49:50,679
that's the only thing that matters to

2913
01:49:49,080 --> 01:49:53,480
Abram at this point and the steward of

2914
01:49:50,679 --> 01:49:56,560
my house is this elier of d damasc us no

2915
01:49:53,480 --> 01:49:59,840
kin and Abraham said Abram said behold

2916
01:49:56,560 --> 01:50:02,719
to me thou Hast given no seed and lo one

2917
01:49:59,840 --> 01:50:05,320
born in my house is mine he and behold

2918
01:50:02,719 --> 01:50:08,800
the word of the Lord came unto

2919
01:50:05,320 --> 01:50:10,199
him saying this shall not be thine Heir

2920
01:50:08,800 --> 01:50:12,119
but he that shall come forth out of

2921
01:50:10,199 --> 01:50:15,080
thine own bowel should be nine hair so

2922
01:50:12,119 --> 01:50:17,400
he gets promised The Impossible once

2923
01:50:15,080 --> 01:50:19,000
again and he brought him forth abroad

2924
01:50:17,400 --> 01:50:20,760
and said now look towards the heaven and

2925
01:50:19,000 --> 01:50:23,400
tell the Stars if thou be able to number

2926
01:50:20,760 --> 01:50:25,679
them and he said unto him so shall thy

2927
01:50:23,400 --> 01:50:28,599
seed be and he believed in the Lord and

2928
01:50:25,679 --> 01:50:28,599
counted to him for

2929
01:50:30,520 --> 01:50:35,400
righteousness you see and this this this

2930
01:50:32,920 --> 01:50:37,800
is the Covenant idea this belief because

2931
01:50:35,400 --> 01:50:37,800
here's the

2932
01:50:39,400 --> 01:50:45,599
belief it's the willingness to act as if

2933
01:50:43,239 --> 01:50:47,920
the world is constructed so that if you

2934
01:50:45,599 --> 01:50:52,119
do the right thing the best possible

2935
01:50:47,920 --> 01:50:53,880
outcome will occur it's a decision

2936
01:50:52,119 --> 01:50:55,880
that's the C Covenant right it's a

2937
01:50:53,880 --> 01:50:57,280
decision about how to live in the world

2938
01:50:55,880 --> 01:50:58,800
because the evidence can't be there

2939
01:50:57,280 --> 01:51:00,719
before you make the

2940
01:50:58,800 --> 01:51:02,639
decision right and so you might hedge

2941
01:51:00,719 --> 01:51:04,480
your bests you know when when Christ

2942
01:51:02,639 --> 01:51:06,159
comes back in the Book of Revelation to

2943
01:51:04,480 --> 01:51:08,280
judge people because he comes back as a

2944
01:51:06,159 --> 01:51:10,840
judge and virtually everyone

2945
01:51:08,280 --> 01:51:14,400
gets cast out with the chaff and not

2946
01:51:10,840 --> 01:51:15,760
saved with the wheat and he he says

2947
01:51:14,400 --> 01:51:17,159
something very interesting he appears in

2948
01:51:15,760 --> 01:51:19,079
the vision with a sword coming out of

2949
01:51:17,159 --> 01:51:23,199
his mouth it's a horrifying

2950
01:51:19,079 --> 01:51:25,159
vision and he divides the the he divides

2951
01:51:23,199 --> 01:51:27,679
Humanity into the Damned and the saved

2952
01:51:25,159 --> 01:51:31,320
or the dam yes the Damned and the saved

2953
01:51:27,679 --> 01:51:34,560
he says something very interesting he

2954
01:51:31,320 --> 01:51:38,360
says to those who were neither hot nor

2955
01:51:34,560 --> 01:51:40,880
cold I will spew you out of my mouth and

2956
01:51:38,360 --> 01:51:44,239
and it's it's a it's a it's a disgust

2957
01:51:40,880 --> 01:51:47,280
metaphor right and what it says is that

2958
01:51:44,239 --> 01:51:47,280
the worst punishment

2959
01:51:47,440 --> 01:51:52,159
isn't waiting

2960
01:51:49,520 --> 01:51:53,840
for those who committed to something and

2961
01:51:52,159 --> 01:51:57,079
did

2962
01:51:53,840 --> 01:51:58,719
wrong the worst punishment is reserved

2963
01:51:57,079 --> 01:52:00,119
for those who committed to nothing and

2964
01:51:58,719 --> 01:52:02,520
stayed on the

2965
01:52:00,119 --> 01:52:03,800
fence and that's really something too

2966
01:52:02,520 --> 01:52:05,239
that's really something to think about

2967
01:52:03,800 --> 01:52:10,000
and it's also something I believe to be

2968
01:52:05,239 --> 01:52:12,840
true because I see that stasis is

2969
01:52:10,000 --> 01:52:14,440
utterly destructive because there's no

2970
01:52:12,840 --> 01:52:16,560
progress all there is is movement

2971
01:52:14,440 --> 01:52:18,599
backwards there's aging and suffering

2972
01:52:16,560 --> 01:52:21,239
and no progress and so to not commit to

2973
01:52:18,599 --> 01:52:24,199
anything is the worst of all

2974
01:52:21,239 --> 01:52:25,599
transgressions to commit means to put

2975
01:52:24,199 --> 01:52:27,520
your body and soul into something to

2976
01:52:25,599 --> 01:52:28,920
offer your life as a sacrifice means

2977
01:52:27,520 --> 01:52:31,239
that you're willing to make a bargain

2978
01:52:28,920 --> 01:52:34,719
with fate and the bargain is I'm going

2979
01:52:31,239 --> 01:52:36,639
to act as if if I give it my all then

2980
01:52:34,719 --> 01:52:40,079
the best possible thing will happen

2981
01:52:36,639 --> 01:52:42,960
because of that and to to not see the

2982
01:52:40,079 --> 01:52:44,840
analogy between that and the the AC of

2983
01:52:42,960 --> 01:52:47,320
faith in God is to misunderstand the

2984
01:52:44,840 --> 01:52:49,719
story completely and it has to be an Act

2985
01:52:47,320 --> 01:52:52,599
of Faith because how are you going to

2986
01:52:49,719 --> 01:52:54,599
know you can look at other people but

2987
01:52:52,599 --> 01:52:56,000
isn't going to do it it's at kirkgard

2988
01:52:54,599 --> 01:52:57,400
was very clear about this sort of thing

2989
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:59,400
there's certain sorts of truths that you

2990
01:52:57,400 --> 01:53:00,800
can only learn for yourself through

2991
01:52:59,400 --> 01:53:02,679
experience and that's of course why

2992
01:53:00,800 --> 01:53:04,440
Abram also has to go out alone right he

2993
01:53:02,679 --> 01:53:07,000
has to leave his K it's it's an

2994
01:53:04,440 --> 01:53:09,320
individual it's the individuation

2995
01:53:07,000 --> 01:53:11,960
process like dying it's something that

2996
01:53:09,320 --> 01:53:14,360
you do alone there's no way you can tell

2997
01:53:11,960 --> 01:53:16,199
what is within your grasp let's say

2998
01:53:14,360 --> 01:53:18,040
unless you make the ultimate

2999
01:53:16,199 --> 01:53:20,199
sacrifice and there's no way of finding

3000
01:53:18,040 --> 01:53:22,840
out without actually making it and so

3001
01:53:20,199 --> 01:53:24,119
that's the sacrificial act right that's

3002
01:53:22,840 --> 01:53:26,400
that's

3003
01:53:24,119 --> 01:53:29,040
reemphasized in the act of

3004
01:53:26,400 --> 01:53:30,800
Abram being called upon to sacrifice

3005
01:53:29,040 --> 01:53:32,960
Isaac you think about that is Abram he's

3006
01:53:30,800 --> 01:53:35,599
been doing he's been like breaking

3007
01:53:32,960 --> 01:53:37,520
himself into pieces trying to progress

3008
01:53:35,599 --> 01:53:39,639
forward through starvation and tyranny

3009
01:53:37,520 --> 01:53:41,679
and War and deceit and the potential

3010
01:53:39,639 --> 01:53:43,480
loss of his wife and childlessness and

3011
01:53:41,679 --> 01:53:46,280
like everything that can really befall

3012
01:53:43,480 --> 01:53:48,320
you in some sense and finally God grants

3013
01:53:46,280 --> 01:53:50,320
him Isaac when he's old it's impossible

3014
01:53:48,320 --> 01:53:52,560
he gets Isaac his son and then what does

3015
01:53:50,320 --> 01:53:54,560
God do next is say well you know that

3016
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:57,079
son that you've been waiting for so for

3017
01:53:54,560 --> 01:53:58,800
so long it's like I'd like to see just

3018
01:53:57,079 --> 01:54:01,280
exactly what you're made of so I think

3019
01:53:58,800 --> 01:54:04,679
you should offer him up as a sacrifice

3020
01:54:01,280 --> 01:54:07,199
and I mean it's a very barbaric story in

3021
01:54:04,679 --> 01:54:12,360
a sense and maybe in more than just a

3022
01:54:07,199 --> 01:54:14,679
sense but Abraham does maintain his

3023
01:54:12,360 --> 01:54:16,880
Covenant he's willing to make the

3024
01:54:14,679 --> 01:54:18,800
sacrifice he's willing to make this is

3025
01:54:16,880 --> 01:54:20,440
the thing he's willing to make whatever

3026
01:54:18,800 --> 01:54:22,800
sacrifice is necessary to keep his

3027
01:54:20,440 --> 01:54:25,920
Covenant with God intact and that that's

3028
01:54:22,800 --> 01:54:28,079
that and that's the

3029
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:30,440
decision well maybe it's no surprise

3030
01:54:28,079 --> 01:54:32,679
that people don't do

3031
01:54:30,440 --> 01:54:34,840
that and he believed in the Lord and he

3032
01:54:32,679 --> 01:54:37,280
counted it to him for righteousness and

3033
01:54:34,840 --> 01:54:39,079
he said unto him I am the Lord that

3034
01:54:37,280 --> 01:54:42,320
brought thee out of er of the cheles to

3035
01:54:39,079 --> 01:54:44,280
give this land to you to inherit it and

3036
01:54:42,320 --> 01:54:46,840
he said Lord God whereby shall I know

3037
01:54:44,280 --> 01:54:49,440
that I shall inherit it and he said to

3038
01:54:46,840 --> 01:54:52,400
him this is a sacrificial story again

3039
01:54:49,440 --> 01:54:54,440
take an E A heer of three years and a

3040
01:54:52,400 --> 01:54:55,800
boat of three years and a ram of three

3041
01:54:54,440 --> 01:54:58,440
years and a turtle dove and a young

3042
01:54:55,800 --> 01:55:00,840
pigeon it's fairly specific actually and

3043
01:54:58,440 --> 01:55:03,400
he took all these and divided them and

3044
01:55:00,840 --> 01:55:05,560
laid each piece one against another but

3045
01:55:03,400 --> 01:55:07,079
the birds divided he not now there's a

3046
01:55:05,560 --> 01:55:09,040
reason for that and I don't know the

3047
01:55:07,079 --> 01:55:11,400
reason for it and when the fowls came

3048
01:55:09,040 --> 01:55:14,199
down upon the carcasses Abram drove them

3049
01:55:11,400 --> 01:55:17,239
away and when the sun was going down a

3050
01:55:14,199 --> 01:55:19,679
deep sleep fell upon Abram and low a

3051
01:55:17,239 --> 01:55:21,040
horror of great Darkness fell upon him

3052
01:55:19,679 --> 01:55:22,840
that didn't mean he was afraid of the

3053
01:55:21,040 --> 01:55:24,480
dark which is what I thought it meant

3054
01:55:22,840 --> 01:55:26,639
when I first read it it isn't what it

3055
01:55:24,480 --> 01:55:29,920
means it means that he fell into a

3056
01:55:26,639 --> 01:55:32,679
trance or something like that and then

3057
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:34,159
he was enveloped by absolute horror so

3058
01:55:32,679 --> 01:55:36,880
that's how this Story

3059
01:55:34,159 --> 01:55:38,400
begins and here's the commentary from

3060
01:55:36,880 --> 01:55:40,360
Joseph Benson who was an English

3061
01:55:38,400 --> 01:55:43,599
Methodist Minister who lived in

3062
01:55:40,360 --> 01:55:46,320
1749 was born in 1749 and when the sun

3063
01:55:43,599 --> 01:55:48,440
was going down about the time of the E

3064
01:55:46,320 --> 01:55:50,280
evening oblation the washing for he

3065
01:55:48,440 --> 01:55:53,040
Abode by them praying and waiting till

3066
01:55:50,280 --> 01:55:55,440
toward evening a deep sleep fell upon

3067
01:55:53,040 --> 01:55:58,239
Abram well this was not a common sleep

3068
01:55:55,440 --> 01:55:59,679
through weariness or carelessness I

3069
01:55:58,239 --> 01:56:02,040
don't know what a Sloop is That's

3070
01:55:59,679 --> 01:56:04,199
supposed to be sleep not a common sleep

3071
01:56:02,040 --> 01:56:05,840
through weariness or car carelessness

3072
01:56:04,199 --> 01:56:08,520
but a Divine

3073
01:56:05,840 --> 01:56:10,800
ecstasy that being wholly taken off from

3074
01:56:08,520 --> 01:56:12,599
things sensible he might be wholly taken

3075
01:56:10,800 --> 01:56:14,360
up with the contemplation of things

3076
01:56:12,599 --> 01:56:16,960
spiritual well it really makes you

3077
01:56:14,360 --> 01:56:20,960
wonder what Abraham was up to in his

3078
01:56:16,960 --> 01:56:20,960
campsite so

3079
01:56:22,599 --> 01:56:26,199
he was participating in something that

3080
01:56:24,560 --> 01:56:29,079
enabled this

3081
01:56:26,199 --> 01:56:30,719
experience and lo a or a horror of great

3082
01:56:29,079 --> 01:56:32,599
Darkness fell upon him this was designed

3083
01:56:30,719 --> 01:56:34,480
to strike awe upon the spirit of Abram

3084
01:56:32,599 --> 01:56:37,480
and to possess him with a holy reverence

3085
01:56:34,480 --> 01:56:39,719
holy fear prepares the soul for Holy Joy

3086
01:56:37,480 --> 01:56:43,599
God humbles first and then lifts

3087
01:56:39,719 --> 01:56:46,679
up Echoes of psychedelic experience and

3088
01:56:43,599 --> 01:56:48,719
he said unto Abram know of assurity that

3089
01:56:46,679 --> 01:56:50,880
thy seed shall be a stranger in a land

3090
01:56:48,719 --> 01:56:52,719
that is not theirs and Shall Serve them

3091
01:56:50,880 --> 01:56:54,199
and they shall afflict them 400 years

3092
01:56:52,719 --> 01:56:56,800
and also that Nation whom they Shall

3093
01:56:54,199 --> 01:56:58,480
Serve I will judge and afterward shall

3094
01:56:56,800 --> 01:57:00,560
they come out with great substance and

3095
01:56:58,480 --> 01:57:02,800
thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace

3096
01:57:00,560 --> 01:57:04,440
Thou shalt be buried in a good old age

3097
01:57:02,800 --> 01:57:06,560
but in the fourth generation they shall

3098
01:57:04,440 --> 01:57:09,520
come hither again for the iniquity of

3099
01:57:06,560 --> 01:57:12,480
the amorites is not yet

3100
01:57:09,520 --> 01:57:15,280
full commentaries of Joseph Benson once

3101
01:57:12,480 --> 01:57:17,679
again they shall come hither again

3102
01:57:15,280 --> 01:57:20,199
hither to the land of Canaan wherein

3103
01:57:17,679 --> 01:57:22,199
thou not now art the reason why they

3104
01:57:20,199 --> 01:57:23,800
must not have the land of promise in

3105
01:57:22,199 --> 01:57:26,199
possession until the fourth generation

3106
01:57:23,800 --> 01:57:28,760
is because the iniquity of the amorites

3107
01:57:26,199 --> 01:57:30,599
was not yet full the righteous God has

3108
01:57:28,760 --> 01:57:32,679
Des determined that the amorites shall

3109
01:57:30,599 --> 01:57:34,960
not be cut off till they arrived at such

3110
01:57:32,679 --> 01:57:36,639
a pitch of w wickedness and therefore

3111
01:57:34,960 --> 01:57:38,360
till it come to that the seed of Abram

3112
01:57:36,639 --> 01:57:39,920
must be kept out of possession so the

3113
01:57:38,360 --> 01:57:41,480
interpretation of the story essentially

3114
01:57:39,920 --> 01:57:44,119
is that Abraham's descendants will end

3115
01:57:41,480 --> 01:57:45,960
up enslaved in Egypt for a long a

3116
01:57:44,119 --> 01:57:48,119
lengthy period of time and eventually

3117
01:57:45,960 --> 01:57:49,639
come back to the land of Canaan and it's

3118
01:57:48,119 --> 01:57:51,599
interesting too because this is part of

3119
01:57:49,639 --> 01:57:54,280
Abram's bargain with God and in this

3120
01:57:51,599 --> 01:57:56,119
divine ision I mean he's been promised

3121
01:57:54,280 --> 01:57:58,560
everything but it's a pretty tough

3122
01:57:56,119 --> 01:58:00,599
bargain because you know when when when

3123
01:57:58,560 --> 01:58:01,960
God is pushed or reveals himself let's

3124
01:58:00,599 --> 01:58:04,480
say he says look you're going to get

3125
01:58:01,960 --> 01:58:07,960
your damn descendants you know but it's

3126
01:58:04,480 --> 01:58:10,280
not going to be uh it's it's it's going

3127
01:58:07,960 --> 01:58:13,079
to be a tough Journey they're going to

3128
01:58:10,280 --> 01:58:14,639
be SL enslaved for a very long time and

3129
01:58:13,079 --> 01:58:17,159
eventually come back and you won't see

3130
01:58:14,639 --> 01:58:19,840
it you'll be dead long before then and

3131
01:58:17,159 --> 01:58:21,639
so it's a realistic promise in a sense

3132
01:58:19,840 --> 01:58:23,079
and you might say well Abram is so D

3133
01:58:21,639 --> 01:58:25,199
desperate to to keep the faith that he's

3134
01:58:23,079 --> 01:58:27,560
willing to read good into what isn't

3135
01:58:25,199 --> 01:58:28,800
good but I think I I think I don't think

3136
01:58:27,560 --> 01:58:30,079
that's the right way to look at it I

3137
01:58:28,800 --> 01:58:31,239
think the right way to look at it is

3138
01:58:30,079 --> 01:58:33,480
that the people who wrote these stories

3139
01:58:31,239 --> 01:58:35,280
were very realistic and they knew that

3140
01:58:33,480 --> 01:58:37,280
even if things turned out well for you I

3141
01:58:35,280 --> 01:58:38,719
mean it was still going to be real you

3142
01:58:37,280 --> 01:58:40,119
know it wasn't going to be some fantasy

3143
01:58:38,719 --> 01:58:41,880
it's like let's say you have a family

3144
01:58:40,119 --> 01:58:43,239
that flourishes is people are still

3145
01:58:41,880 --> 01:58:45,040
going to die they're still going to get

3146
01:58:43,239 --> 01:58:46,520
sick they're they're still going to have

3147
01:58:45,040 --> 01:58:49,000
they're still going to be alive you know

3148
01:58:46,520 --> 01:58:50,880
with all of its suffering but it'll be

3149
01:58:49,000 --> 01:58:52,719
the but it'll be a life that's rich

3150
01:58:50,880 --> 01:58:58,079
enough and complete enough so that it'll

3151
01:58:52,719 --> 01:58:58,079
justify its its nature essentially and

3152
01:58:58,400 --> 01:59:02,760
so and it came to pass that when the sun

3153
01:59:00,920 --> 01:59:05,079
went down and it was dark Behold a

3154
01:59:02,760 --> 01:59:06,560
smoking furnace and a burning lamp that

3155
01:59:05,079 --> 01:59:09,560
passed between the

3156
01:59:06,560 --> 01:59:11,760
pieces Albert barns American Theologian

3157
01:59:09,560 --> 01:59:14,079
commented on this the oven of smoke and

3158
01:59:11,760 --> 01:59:16,159
lamp of flame symbolize the smoke of

3159
01:59:14,079 --> 01:59:17,719
Destruction and the light of Salvation

3160
01:59:16,159 --> 01:59:20,000
they're passing passing through the

3161
01:59:17,719 --> 01:59:21,760
pieces of the sacrificial victims and

3162
01:59:20,000 --> 01:59:24,000
probably consuming them as an accepted

3163
01:59:21,760 --> 01:59:26,040
sacri rifice are the ratification of the

3164
01:59:24,000 --> 01:59:27,639
Covenant on the part of God as the

3165
01:59:26,040 --> 01:59:29,360
dividing and presenting of them were on

3166
01:59:27,639 --> 01:59:31,719
the part of

3167
01:59:29,360 --> 01:59:33,719
Abram in the same day the Lord made a

3168
01:59:31,719 --> 01:59:35,679
covenant with Abram saying unto thy seed

3169
01:59:33,719 --> 01:59:37,560
I have given this land from the river of

3170
01:59:35,679 --> 01:59:39,760
Egypt unto the Great River the river

3171
01:59:37,560 --> 01:59:42,119
Euphrates the kenites and the kenites

3172
01:59:39,760 --> 01:59:45,520
and the cadit

3173
01:59:42,119 --> 01:59:48,560
ETC now Sarai Abram's wife bear him no

3174
01:59:45,520 --> 01:59:51,440
children and she had a handmade wait a

3175
01:59:48,560 --> 01:59:54,880
second I think we'll stop there I'm

3176
01:59:51,440 --> 01:59:59,330
tiring out and it's just and it's 929 so

3177
01:59:54,880 --> 02:00:02,639
that's a very good place to stop so

3178
01:59:59,330 --> 02:00:07,000
[Applause]

3179
02:00:02,639 --> 02:00:09,960
yes so so I

3180
02:00:07,000 --> 02:00:14,000
should I should close properly and just

3181
02:00:09,960 --> 02:00:16,360
sum up so what happens here is that that

3182
02:00:14,000 --> 02:00:19,239
Abram enters into a covenant with God to

3183
02:00:16,360 --> 02:00:22,440
act in the world and the action is an

3184
02:00:19,239 --> 02:00:25,520
adventure story essentially and the

3185
02:00:22,440 --> 02:00:29,360
adventures repeat and they're and

3186
02:00:25,520 --> 02:00:31,360
they're punctuated by success and S and

3187
02:00:29,360 --> 02:00:33,599
sacrifice and Rec contemplation right

3188
02:00:31,360 --> 02:00:36,199
and so it's this it's this journey it's

3189
02:00:33,599 --> 02:00:39,719
the it's the hero's journey uphill I'm

3190
02:00:36,199 --> 02:00:42,000
here there's a crisis I Collapse I

3191
02:00:39,719 --> 02:00:43,599
reconstruct myself to a higher place and

3192
02:00:42,000 --> 02:00:45,400
life is like that continually and that's

3193
02:00:43,599 --> 02:00:47,040
the story of Abraham and that's all

3194
02:00:45,400 --> 02:00:48,719
contained though it's all contained and

3195
02:00:47,040 --> 02:00:50,040
this is the thing that's so cool because

3196
02:00:48,719 --> 02:00:51,760
that is what your life is going to be

3197
02:00:50,040 --> 02:00:52,440
like whether you plan out your life or

3198
02:00:51,760 --> 02:00:54,760
not

3199
02:00:52,440 --> 02:00:56,599
it's going to be punctuated like that

3200
02:00:54,760 --> 02:00:58,119
maybe it won't go up maybe it'll go down

3201
02:00:56,599 --> 02:01:00,119
the question is what sort of container

3202
02:00:58,119 --> 02:01:03,079
do you need to be in in order to

3203
02:01:00,119 --> 02:01:04,360
tolerate the movement up and down and

3204
02:01:03,079 --> 02:01:06,440
that's what the story of Abraham

3205
02:01:04,360 --> 02:01:08,360
provides it provides a it provides a

3206
02:01:06,440 --> 02:01:10,079
description of the Covenant that's like

3207
02:01:08,360 --> 02:01:12,280
the ark the Covenant and the Ark are the

3208
02:01:10,079 --> 02:01:12,960
same thing right except the Covenant is

3209
02:01:12,280 --> 02:01:15,079
the

3210
02:01:12,960 --> 02:01:17,679
psychological equivalent of the Ark and

3211
02:01:15,079 --> 02:01:17,679
the Covenant

3212
02:01:18,079 --> 02:01:23,719
is have faith in the structure of

3213
02:01:20,440 --> 02:01:26,599
existence and go forth forth that's the

3214
02:01:23,719 --> 02:01:29,719
Covenant and the and the story

3215
02:01:26,599 --> 02:01:32,360
is that's the best possible solution

3216
02:01:29,719 --> 02:01:36,079
that you have at

3217
02:01:32,360 --> 02:01:38,440
hand all right so I'm going to make a

3218
02:01:36,079 --> 02:01:40,119
request with regards to the questions

3219
02:01:38,440 --> 02:01:42,840
which may mean you have to reorient

3220
02:01:40,119 --> 02:01:46,679
yourself in the line I would like the

3221
02:01:42,840 --> 02:01:48,639
first two questions on each side if

3222
02:01:46,679 --> 02:01:51,719
possible to relate specifically to

3223
02:01:48,639 --> 02:01:53,679
tonight's lecture and then I can and

3224
02:01:51,719 --> 02:01:57,159
then I can

3225
02:01:53,679 --> 02:02:00,960
uh address more General issues if that's

3226
02:01:57,159 --> 02:02:03,239
if that's okay so and I again I would

3227
02:02:00,960 --> 02:02:05,480
like you to carefully speak into the mic

3228
02:02:03,239 --> 02:02:08,520
so that the people who are watching can

3229
02:02:05,480 --> 02:02:13,320
hear can you hear me yeah I

3230
02:02:08,520 --> 02:02:15,560
can uh the story about Abraham uh saying

3231
02:02:13,320 --> 02:02:18,040
his wife was his sister you referred to

3232
02:02:15,560 --> 02:02:19,679
that as him making a mistake I'm not

3233
02:02:18,040 --> 02:02:21,639
quite sure I understand how you're

3234
02:02:19,679 --> 02:02:23,840
reading that as a mistake seeing as it

3235
02:02:21,639 --> 02:02:26,520
was very deliberate decision and it had

3236
02:02:23,840 --> 02:02:29,440
a pretty good outcome for him and he

3237
02:02:26,520 --> 02:02:32,719
does the same thing a few chapters later

3238
02:02:29,440 --> 02:02:34,920
yes this is true you see I don't I don't

3239
02:02:32,719 --> 02:02:37,040
I don't feel that I've cracked that part

3240
02:02:34,920 --> 02:02:38,679
of that story properly now the reason I

3241
02:02:37,040 --> 02:02:41,400
said it was a mistake is because it's

3242
02:02:38,679 --> 02:02:43,040
clearly an act of Deceit and it and it

3243
02:02:41,400 --> 02:02:45,560
and it does put the Pharaoh in a very

3244
02:02:43,040 --> 02:02:47,520
awkward position not to mention s Sarai

3245
02:02:45,560 --> 02:02:51,360
by the way or S how do you say that I

3246
02:02:47,520 --> 02:02:53,719
don't know how to say that Sarai Sarai

3247
02:02:51,360 --> 02:02:56,639
it's SAR to begin with yes is that right

3248
02:02:53,719 --> 02:02:59,800
Sarai yes okay and then it's Sarah and

3249
02:02:56,639 --> 02:03:01,599
that so Abram means High King something

3250
02:02:59,800 --> 02:03:03,719
like that and Abraham means father of

3251
02:03:01,599 --> 02:03:06,400
the people and Sarai means princess and

3252
02:03:03,719 --> 02:03:08,119
Sarah means mother of the people it's

3253
02:03:06,400 --> 02:03:09,440
some I I have it exactly right I'll tell

3254
02:03:08,119 --> 02:03:12,360
you next week but that's part of the

3255
02:03:09,440 --> 02:03:14,920
name transformation the the it it seems

3256
02:03:12,360 --> 02:03:19,239
to me that at least in part it's an

3257
02:03:14,920 --> 02:03:23,159
indication of Abra Abraham's willingness

3258
02:03:19,239 --> 02:03:25,360
to use a suboptimal solution when driven

3259
02:03:23,159 --> 02:03:27,520
to it by necessity I don't think it's a

3260
02:03:25,360 --> 02:03:30,679
heroic act to pretend that your wife is

3261
02:03:27,520 --> 02:03:32,320
your sister now you know and and and

3262
02:03:30,679 --> 02:03:33,760
maybe you might say well under the

3263
02:03:32,320 --> 02:03:36,719
circumstances there was nothing else he

3264
02:03:33,760 --> 02:03:38,520
could have done but it does seem I can't

3265
02:03:36,719 --> 02:03:40,920
see how you can interpret it other than

3266
02:03:38,520 --> 02:03:43,280
as a departure from the

3267
02:03:40,920 --> 02:03:44,880
truth but I know that that's not all

3268
02:03:43,280 --> 02:03:47,719
there is to it and it does seem to work

3269
02:03:44,880 --> 02:03:50,239
out well for him and my interpretation

3270
02:03:47,719 --> 02:03:53,639
is that well if you're oriented properly

3271
02:03:50,239 --> 02:03:56,040
in the world the grace of God allows you

3272
02:03:53,639 --> 02:04:00,000
a few necessary mistakes something like

3273
02:03:56,040 --> 02:04:02,440
that do do you have an alternative

3274
02:04:00,000 --> 02:04:04,679
idea I just don't think I would refer to

3275
02:04:02,440 --> 02:04:06,719
it as a mistake well why not what what

3276
02:04:04,679 --> 02:04:08,920
is it about that that that is it because

3277
02:04:06,719 --> 02:04:10,599
it's Abraham and and it isn't reasonable

3278
02:04:08,920 --> 02:04:12,920
to attribute mistakes to him or what is

3279
02:04:10,599 --> 02:04:16,239
it it's cuz at least I think it says in

3280
02:04:12,920 --> 02:04:21,159
the text that he's looking to get out of

3281
02:04:16,239 --> 02:04:22,520
a bad situation and he does whatever is

3282
02:04:21,159 --> 02:04:25,360
the best thing that it's available to

3283
02:04:22,520 --> 02:04:28,199
him and not to mention as I said he does

3284
02:04:25,360 --> 02:04:31,599
the same trick a few chapters later yeah

3285
02:04:28,199 --> 02:04:33,520
well maybe maybe it is the case that you

3286
02:04:31,599 --> 02:04:36,320
know it's like a white lie issue you

3287
02:04:33,520 --> 02:04:38,360
know you say well is a white lie

3288
02:04:36,320 --> 02:04:40,679
acceptable I would say well the best

3289
02:04:38,360 --> 02:04:42,760
that you can come up with is acceptable

3290
02:04:40,679 --> 02:04:47,199
that that doesn't mean it's it's optimal

3291
02:04:42,760 --> 02:04:49,000
though right like I I I I'll give you a

3292
02:04:47,199 --> 02:04:50,719
a foolish example because it's the best

3293
02:04:49,000 --> 02:04:52,760
that I could do at the moment but you

3294
02:04:50,719 --> 02:04:56,599
know if you if you have a loved one who

3295
02:04:52,760 --> 02:04:59,079
says does this dress make me look

3296
02:04:56,599 --> 02:05:01,440
fat the answer to that question is I

3297
02:04:59,079 --> 02:05:03,040
don't answer questions like that that's

3298
02:05:01,440 --> 02:05:05,520
the answer right because the other

3299
02:05:03,040 --> 02:05:08,280
answer is the white lie I mean at least

3300
02:05:05,520 --> 02:05:11,199
in this context and that means that on

3301
02:05:08,280 --> 02:05:13,800
the one hand you're maintaining the the

3302
02:05:11,199 --> 02:05:15,960
the positive contract between you and

3303
02:05:13,800 --> 02:05:17,840
the person who's asking the question but

3304
02:05:15,960 --> 02:05:20,800
then you're still sacrificing the truth

3305
02:05:17,840 --> 02:05:22,520
within that so you're you're you're

3306
02:05:20,800 --> 02:05:24,440
maintaining your relationship with the

3307
02:05:22,520 --> 02:05:26,639
higher ordered truth but sacrificing a

3308
02:05:24,440 --> 02:05:28,360
lower order truth and and that would be

3309
02:05:26,639 --> 02:05:31,520
better than the reverse but it's not as

3310
02:05:28,360 --> 02:05:33,760
good as not sacrificing the truth at all

3311
02:05:31,520 --> 02:05:35,559
and I would say that if you're maybe

3312
02:05:33,760 --> 02:05:37,400
fortunate because sometimes it's a

3313
02:05:35,559 --> 02:05:39,960
matter because you can be in a situation

3314
02:05:37,400 --> 02:05:41,520
where all your choices are bad I've seen

3315
02:05:39,960 --> 02:05:42,960
people in situations like that I've

3316
02:05:41,520 --> 02:05:44,440
probably been in situations like that

3317
02:05:42,960 --> 02:05:46,480
and maybe that is what's happening in

3318
02:05:44,440 --> 02:05:48,520
that story is every choice Abraham is in

3319
02:05:46,480 --> 02:05:50,679
front of him is bad but I can't help but

3320
02:05:48,520 --> 02:05:52,639
think that it's more than that it means

3321
02:05:50,679 --> 02:05:54,880
that

3322
02:05:52,639 --> 02:05:57,320
if you're doing the best you can and

3323
02:05:54,880 --> 02:06:00,320
it's not perfect it can still be good

3324
02:05:57,320 --> 02:06:03,520
enough that's how it looks to

3325
02:06:00,320 --> 02:06:03,520
me thank

3326
02:06:05,119 --> 02:06:10,320
you hello Dr Peterson uh you mentioned

3327
02:06:08,559 --> 02:06:13,599
earlier that there's been a pervasive

3328
02:06:10,320 --> 02:06:15,159
problem of nihilism and moral relativism

3329
02:06:13,599 --> 02:06:16,000
uh and that that can kind of be cured

3330
02:06:15,159 --> 02:06:19,119
with

3331
02:06:16,000 --> 02:06:21,320
a less naive optimism that's grounded in

3332
02:06:19,119 --> 02:06:23,719
fact and what can actually be done to

3333
02:06:21,320 --> 02:06:26,119
improve improv situations is there a way

3334
02:06:23,719 --> 02:06:27,800
to communicate that message to a younger

3335
02:06:26,119 --> 02:06:30,079
audience say teenagers in a high school

3336
02:06:27,800 --> 02:06:31,400
environment which is nowadays a hot bed

3337
02:06:30,079 --> 02:06:32,559
for this kind of nihilistic morally

3338
02:06:31,400 --> 02:06:35,800
relativist

3339
02:06:32,559 --> 02:06:38,679
thinking great I'm glad you asked

3340
02:06:35,800 --> 02:06:39,880
that so I'm going to tell you I was

3341
02:06:38,679 --> 02:06:41,840
thinking about saying this at the

3342
02:06:39,880 --> 02:06:43,360
beginning but I decided not to but now I

3343
02:06:41,840 --> 02:06:48,280
get to say it because I got this

3344
02:06:43,360 --> 02:06:50,000
question so that's so cool um I I have

3345
02:06:48,280 --> 02:06:52,599
plans and

3346
02:06:50,000 --> 02:06:55,880
so plan number number

3347
02:06:52,599 --> 02:06:57,960
one I have worked with some people to

3348
02:06:55,880 --> 02:06:59,840
design a website that will enable High

3349
02:06:57,960 --> 02:07:01,040
University students to enter their

3350
02:06:59,840 --> 02:07:03,599
course

3351
02:07:01,040 --> 02:07:05,960
descriptions their professor's name the

3352
02:07:03,599 --> 02:07:08,599
subdiscipline and the university and an

3353
02:07:05,960 --> 02:07:11,040
artificial intelligence agent will tell

3354
02:07:08,599 --> 02:07:13,520
them if the course is postmodern Neo

3355
02:07:11,040 --> 02:07:13,520
Marxist

3356
02:07:15,199 --> 02:07:22,440
indoctrination not not only and I have

3357
02:07:19,559 --> 02:07:25,639
made tentative Arrangements

3358
02:07:22,440 --> 02:07:29,840
with someone to finance a advertising

3359
02:07:25,639 --> 02:07:33,360
campaign for that site and so the goal

3360
02:07:29,840 --> 02:07:34,840
is well to inform the consumer do you

3361
02:07:33,360 --> 02:07:37,119
want to be educated or do you want to be

3362
02:07:34,840 --> 02:07:38,920
indoctrinated and happily you'll be able

3363
02:07:37,119 --> 02:07:41,639
to use the site equally for both

3364
02:07:38,920 --> 02:07:46,119
purposes right because if you want to if

3365
02:07:41,639 --> 02:07:47,760
you want to take the the the courses

3366
02:07:46,119 --> 02:07:49,880
that I would regard as indoctrination

3367
02:07:47,760 --> 02:07:51,559
then this will give you a way of

3368
02:07:49,880 --> 02:07:55,079
ensuring that nothing that you get

3369
02:07:51,559 --> 02:07:57,599
exposed to won't be of that sort so and

3370
02:07:55,079 --> 02:08:00,520
then I'm going to make a video to

3371
02:07:57,599 --> 02:08:02,480
introduce that to University students

3372
02:08:00,520 --> 02:08:03,960
and their parents and I'm going to

3373
02:08:02,480 --> 02:08:06,320
outline what I think the universities

3374
02:08:03,960 --> 02:08:08,400
are doing wrong there's about 20 things

3375
02:08:06,320 --> 02:08:11,880
they're doing wrong and and they're

3376
02:08:08,400 --> 02:08:14,599
seriously wrong things and I'm going to

3377
02:08:11,880 --> 02:08:16,199
start by describing the utility of a

3378
02:08:14,599 --> 02:08:18,559
university education a Humanities

3379
02:08:16,199 --> 02:08:20,159
education because hum's education makes

3380
02:08:18,559 --> 02:08:22,960
you into the kind of autonomous

3381
02:08:20,159 --> 02:08:25,199
individual that can go away from that

3382
02:08:22,960 --> 02:08:27,920
can be independent and can communicate

3383
02:08:25,199 --> 02:08:30,840
and think and that has immense economic

3384
02:08:27,920 --> 02:08:33,320
value right not not just spiritual value

3385
02:08:30,840 --> 02:08:35,480
and cultural value but economic value

3386
02:08:33,320 --> 02:08:36,880
and so there's I don't want to tell

3387
02:08:35,480 --> 02:08:38,239
people not to go to university I want to

3388
02:08:36,880 --> 02:08:40,400
tell them to go to university and grow

3389
02:08:38,239 --> 02:08:42,040
the hell up and and learn to communicate

3390
02:08:40,400 --> 02:08:43,639
and think and I want them to avoid the

3391
02:08:42,040 --> 02:08:45,719
people who will take the spirit away

3392
02:08:43,639 --> 02:08:48,199
from them and so that's what that

3393
02:08:45,719 --> 02:08:50,719
website is going to do I hope and the

3394
02:08:48,199 --> 02:08:53,000
goal is to drop the enrollment in the

3395
02:08:50,719 --> 02:08:56,199
indoctrination courses across the

3396
02:08:53,000 --> 02:08:59,320
English-speaking World by 75% within 5

3397
02:08:56,199 --> 02:08:59,320
years that's the

3398
02:09:00,599 --> 02:09:05,079
goal

3399
02:09:02,480 --> 02:09:07,400
so and then you asked that you asked

3400
02:09:05,079 --> 02:09:10,520
more specifically about high school

3401
02:09:07,400 --> 02:09:12,320
students well we have this future

3402
02:09:10,520 --> 02:09:14,320
authoring program that has been used for

3403
02:09:12,320 --> 02:09:17,840
University students and it produces

3404
02:09:14,320 --> 02:09:19,679
about a 30% Improvement in retention and

3405
02:09:17,840 --> 02:09:21,119
we've tested several thousand University

3406
02:09:19,679 --> 02:09:23,360
students anyone can use it by the way

3407
02:09:21,119 --> 02:09:25,280
it's not for University students but it

3408
02:09:23,360 --> 02:09:27,400
was easy for us to test its beneficial

3409
02:09:25,280 --> 02:09:29,800
impact even if people only spend under

3410
02:09:27,400 --> 02:09:32,719
90 minutes on it it's still has

3411
02:09:29,800 --> 02:09:33,920
approximately that effect especially on

3412
02:09:32,719 --> 02:09:37,040
young

3413
02:09:33,920 --> 02:09:39,440
men especially if they're ethnic

3414
02:09:37,040 --> 02:09:41,400
minorities especially if they're not

3415
02:09:39,440 --> 02:09:43,400
oriented towards a career and didn't do

3416
02:09:41,400 --> 02:09:45,079
very well in school and so that's really

3417
02:09:43,400 --> 02:09:47,679
cool because it's really hard to design

3418
02:09:45,079 --> 02:09:49,639
a psychological intervention that helps

3419
02:09:47,679 --> 02:09:51,400
the people who are doing the worst most

3420
02:09:49,639 --> 02:09:52,480
psychological interventions so imagine

3421
02:09:51,400 --> 02:09:54,239
there are people who are doing not so

3422
02:09:52,480 --> 02:09:56,480
well and people who are doing well and

3423
02:09:54,239 --> 02:09:57,840
you produce a psychological intervention

3424
02:09:56,480 --> 02:10:01,079
what usually happens is the people who

3425
02:09:57,840 --> 02:10:02,880
are doing well benefit even more right

3426
02:10:01,079 --> 02:10:05,199
but this seems to work for the

3427
02:10:02,880 --> 02:10:07,599
disenfranchised so we're thrilled about

3428
02:10:05,199 --> 02:10:10,520
that really and so we've produced a ver

3429
02:10:07,599 --> 02:10:12,440
version for high school students yes and

3430
02:10:10,520 --> 02:10:14,159
so but we don't have them look three to

3431
02:10:12,440 --> 02:10:16,440
five years out into the future because

3432
02:10:14,159 --> 02:10:19,520
they can't and they don't know enough

3433
02:10:16,440 --> 02:10:21,520
you know it's hard for f full fully

3434
02:10:19,520 --> 02:10:23,559
mature adults to look that far into into

3435
02:10:21,520 --> 02:10:25,719
the future high school kids can probably

3436
02:10:23,559 --> 02:10:26,960
manage 3 to six months and so we're

3437
02:10:25,719 --> 02:10:29,960
going to have them concentrate on

3438
02:10:26,960 --> 02:10:31,559
character development and and what they

3439
02:10:29,960 --> 02:10:33,559
want for their from their friendships

3440
02:10:31,559 --> 02:10:34,800
and how they would like to orient

3441
02:10:33,559 --> 02:10:36,679
themselves in school and to start

3442
02:10:34,800 --> 02:10:38,360
thinking about the sorts of person that

3443
02:10:36,679 --> 02:10:40,639
they would like to be and that never

3444
02:10:38,360 --> 02:10:43,599
happens in schools weirdly enough

3445
02:10:40,639 --> 02:10:45,480
there's a guy named John Gat who won the

3446
02:10:43,599 --> 02:10:47,360
teacher of the year award in New York

3447
02:10:45,480 --> 02:10:49,840
City and then in New York state and then

3448
02:10:47,360 --> 02:10:51,520
stopped being a teacher by the way um he

3449
02:10:49,840 --> 02:10:54,239
wrote a series of books about the

3450
02:10:51,520 --> 02:10:56,159
education system that explain why

3451
02:10:54,239 --> 02:10:58,920
students in

3452
02:10:56,159 --> 02:11:01,559
pre-university education aren't taught

3453
02:10:58,920 --> 02:11:03,719
to be autonomous individuals it's very

3454
02:11:01,559 --> 02:11:06,079
interesting what he's discovered

3455
02:11:03,719 --> 02:11:08,880
historically but anyways we're going to

3456
02:11:06,079 --> 02:11:10,480
Market that probably to parents and to

3457
02:11:08,880 --> 02:11:12,159
University students themselves rather

3458
02:11:10,480 --> 02:11:14,800
than to the schools because our

3459
02:11:12,159 --> 02:11:16,079
experience has been that producing this

3460
02:11:14,800 --> 02:11:18,079
sort of material directly for

3461
02:11:16,079 --> 02:11:20,079
individuals works much better it's much

3462
02:11:18,079 --> 02:11:22,679
more efficient and so then students will

3463
02:11:20,079 --> 02:11:24,040
be able to or or their parents will be

3464
02:11:22,679 --> 02:11:26,639
able to purchase the program and the

3465
02:11:24,040 --> 02:11:29,960
students will be able to use it to

3466
02:11:26,639 --> 02:11:32,880
design their own personality in a manner

3467
02:11:29,960 --> 02:11:35,400
that would make them thrilled to be

3468
02:11:32,880 --> 02:11:39,140
alive let's say that would be the goal

3469
02:11:35,400 --> 02:11:45,720
right that would be amazing see

3470
02:11:39,140 --> 02:11:45,720
[Applause]

3471
02:11:49,440 --> 02:11:54,159
yes I question

3472
02:11:52,440 --> 02:11:57,800
I'm I'm going to get you to turn it to

3473
02:11:54,159 --> 02:11:59,880
put it down a little more even excellent

3474
02:11:57,800 --> 02:12:02,880
perfect

3475
02:11:59,880 --> 02:12:02,880
yes

3476
02:12:07,360 --> 02:12:13,000
yesl yeah and I I think um especially

3477
02:12:11,800 --> 02:12:15,119
the literature and developmental

3478
02:12:13,000 --> 02:12:16,440
psychology I think Bears this out but um

3479
02:12:15,119 --> 02:12:19,760
I think a huge part of learning is

3480
02:12:16,440 --> 02:12:22,000
interaction and discourse and that seems

3481
02:12:19,760 --> 02:12:23,920
very difficult in an online setting um

3482
02:12:22,000 --> 02:12:25,880
even if it's through text I don't I

3483
02:12:23,920 --> 02:12:27,159
don't quite see it as the same thing and

3484
02:12:25,880 --> 02:12:29,920
additionally I think there's a huge

3485
02:12:27,159 --> 02:12:33,400
motivational Factor that's uh difficult

3486
02:12:29,920 --> 02:12:35,360
to um it's difficult to keep motivated

3487
02:12:33,400 --> 02:12:37,520
when you're isolated and nobody else

3488
02:12:35,360 --> 02:12:38,840
around you is pursuing the same goal so

3489
02:12:37,520 --> 02:12:42,920
um how would you address those you're

3490
02:12:38,840 --> 02:12:45,159
absolutely right on both counts um I

3491
02:12:42,920 --> 02:12:47,920
would say that the idea of an online

3492
02:12:45,159 --> 02:12:50,040
Humanities University is grandiose and

3493
02:12:47,920 --> 02:12:51,679
it may not be possible and the reason

3494
02:12:50,040 --> 02:12:53,880
for that is that

3495
02:12:51,679 --> 02:12:57,040
and as you're alluding to we actually

3496
02:12:53,880 --> 02:12:59,840
don't understand what the university is

3497
02:12:57,040 --> 02:13:01,960
we think it's lectures and exams but

3498
02:12:59,840 --> 02:13:05,280
it's probably

3499
02:13:01,960 --> 02:13:07,559
not it's certainly being together with

3500
02:13:05,280 --> 02:13:10,239
people of your own age as you start your

3501
02:13:07,559 --> 02:13:13,239
life it's moving away from your

3502
02:13:10,239 --> 02:13:16,440
household it's establishing yourself as

3503
02:13:13,239 --> 02:13:19,599
a credible intellect right it's it's

3504
02:13:16,440 --> 02:13:21,840
picking a new group of peers it's all of

3505
02:13:19,599 --> 02:13:24,880
those things and it isn't n clear how

3506
02:13:21,840 --> 02:13:26,119
that can be replicated online now the

3507
02:13:24,880 --> 02:13:28,079
people that I'm talking to are

3508
02:13:26,119 --> 02:13:30,239
sophisticated enough to understand

3509
02:13:28,079 --> 02:13:33,040
Marshall mclin's dicum that the medium

3510
02:13:30,239 --> 02:13:35,599
is the message and so I think it would

3511
02:13:33,040 --> 02:13:38,199
be a mistake to attempt to duplicate the

3512
02:13:35,599 --> 02:13:41,000
University online because you

3513
02:13:38,199 --> 02:13:43,040
can't but so what we're concentrating on

3514
02:13:41,000 --> 02:13:45,440
right now is not so much content but

3515
02:13:43,040 --> 02:13:47,960
infrastructure the question is we want

3516
02:13:45,440 --> 02:13:49,679
to set up an educ an a system of

3517
02:13:47,960 --> 02:13:52,079
education online that will be

3518
02:13:49,679 --> 02:13:55,239
autonomously self governing and

3519
02:13:52,079 --> 02:13:57,119
self-improving and the content in some

3520
02:13:55,239 --> 02:13:59,239
sense we're not so much interested in

3521
02:13:57,119 --> 02:14:01,480
the content as we are interested in the

3522
02:13:59,239 --> 02:14:04,679
process by which people who generate

3523
02:14:01,480 --> 02:14:06,559
good content might be optimally rewarded

3524
02:14:04,679 --> 02:14:08,239
and that's what we want to get right and

3525
02:14:06,559 --> 02:14:11,239
that's probably a discussion that'll

3526
02:14:08,239 --> 02:14:14,559
take a a year or two years to to flesh

3527
02:14:11,239 --> 02:14:17,000
out we we started to conceptualize what

3528
02:14:14,559 --> 02:14:17,880
the system might look like but but to

3529
02:14:17,000 --> 02:14:21,480
your

3530
02:14:17,880 --> 02:14:23,040
point it isn't we're not taking lectures

3531
02:14:21,480 --> 02:14:24,960
and putting them online although

3532
02:14:23,040 --> 02:14:26,639
obviously that's what I'm doing that

3533
02:14:24,960 --> 02:14:29,159
that that isn't going to make an online

3534
02:14:26,639 --> 02:14:31,159
Humanities University and we know that I

3535
02:14:29,159 --> 02:14:34,360
think everything you said is exact is is

3536
02:14:31,159 --> 02:14:36,000
very accurate and also indicative of the

3537
02:14:34,360 --> 02:14:39,239
high probability that something like

3538
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:40,679
this would fail so but you know we're

3539
02:14:39,239 --> 02:14:43,599
we're we're going to try to be aware of

3540
02:14:40,679 --> 02:14:45,280
the pitfalls we're also going to I read

3541
02:14:43,599 --> 02:14:47,040
this great book I would recommend this

3542
02:14:45,280 --> 02:14:48,960
book it's it's a very funny book by a

3543
02:14:47,040 --> 02:14:51,040
guy named John Gaul it's called

3544
02:14:48,960 --> 02:14:53,639
systemantics and it's a cult class

3545
02:14:51,040 --> 02:14:55,440
classic systematics and it's about how

3546
02:14:53,639 --> 02:14:57,520
systems really work and how they fail

3547
02:14:55,440 --> 02:14:59,559
and it's a work of ironic comedy but

3548
02:14:57,520 --> 02:15:01,920
it's quite brilliant and one of the

3549
02:14:59,559 --> 02:15:03,800
things one line he it's it's made of a

3550
02:15:01,920 --> 02:15:06,599
bunch of axioms and here's one Axiom I

3551
02:15:03,800 --> 02:15:09,719
just love this is the system does not do

3552
02:15:06,599 --> 02:15:11,719
what its name says it does and so what I

3553
02:15:09,719 --> 02:15:13,840
worked in Alberta Social Services when I

3554
02:15:11,719 --> 02:15:17,559
was a kid about 18 or so and I worked as

3555
02:15:13,840 --> 02:15:19,280
a consultant and I I one of the and and

3556
02:15:17,559 --> 02:15:21,199
I I got involved in projects that were

3557
02:15:19,280 --> 02:15:23,840
above my pay grade I would say and I

3558
02:15:21,199 --> 02:15:25,920
learned a lot about how how large

3559
02:15:23,840 --> 02:15:29,079
bureaucracies functioned and I was asked

3560
02:15:25,920 --> 02:15:30,719
at one point to update a report that had

3561
02:15:29,079 --> 02:15:32,920
been made the year before about what

3562
02:15:30,719 --> 02:15:35,119
percentage of the spending of the social

3563
02:15:32,920 --> 02:15:38,320
services department actually went to the

3564
02:15:35,119 --> 02:15:41,520
recipients of welfare and and social Aid

3565
02:15:38,320 --> 02:15:45,119
in general and the answer was the system

3566
02:15:41,520 --> 02:15:46,760
did not know and could not find out and

3567
02:15:45,119 --> 02:15:49,159
they had hired a very expensive

3568
02:15:46,760 --> 02:15:51,360
consulting firm to answer that question

3569
02:15:49,159 --> 02:15:53,400
the year before and I was asked update

3570
02:15:51,360 --> 02:15:54,880
it which was quite odd to begin with but

3571
02:15:53,400 --> 02:15:56,599
then I did I went and looked at the

3572
02:15:54,880 --> 02:15:59,639
Consulting report and I went into the

3573
02:15:56,599 --> 02:16:01,960
data and what I found was that none of

3574
02:15:59,639 --> 02:16:03,280
it was real but even more importantly

3575
02:16:01,960 --> 02:16:04,960
there was no way of knowing whether it

3576
02:16:03,280 --> 02:16:07,639
was true or false because the system had

3577
02:16:04,960 --> 02:16:09,639
never been set up to calculate what

3578
02:16:07,639 --> 02:16:11,239
percentage of its total spending

3579
02:16:09,639 --> 02:16:13,440
actually went to the recipients of

3580
02:16:11,239 --> 02:16:14,800
social Aid it just blew me away and then

3581
02:16:13,440 --> 02:16:17,639
I thought and I was reading this book at

3582
02:16:14,800 --> 02:16:19,199
the same time and I thought oh the

3583
02:16:17,639 --> 02:16:21,280
purpose of the social services

3584
02:16:19,199 --> 02:16:23,520
department is to employ people in the

3585
02:16:21,280 --> 02:16:25,599
social services department and I mean I

3586
02:16:23,520 --> 02:16:27,480
wasn't being cynical about that it's

3587
02:16:25,599 --> 02:16:30,119
like charity most Charities you know

3588
02:16:27,480 --> 02:16:33,880
it's like 90% overhead so what does the

3589
02:16:30,119 --> 02:16:35,359
charity do it runs itself now you don't

3590
02:16:33,880 --> 02:16:37,359
want to be cynical about that because

3591
02:16:35,359 --> 02:16:38,719
big businesses are the same and most

3592
02:16:37,359 --> 02:16:41,240
like even if they're running at a profit

3593
02:16:38,719 --> 02:16:43,880
the profit is like 5% so the business

3594
02:16:41,240 --> 02:16:45,840
spends 95% of its time maintaining

3595
02:16:43,880 --> 02:16:47,479
itself you know and it makes a bit of

3596
02:16:45,840 --> 02:16:49,719
product and it makes a bit of profit but

3597
02:16:47,479 --> 02:16:53,760
most of what it does is maintain itself

3598
02:16:49,719 --> 02:16:55,160
so anyways one of the axim in that book

3599
02:16:53,760 --> 02:16:57,800
that was one of them is the system does

3600
02:16:55,160 --> 02:16:59,200
not do what it says it does so that's

3601
02:16:57,800 --> 02:17:01,920
because then you can face the system

3602
02:16:59,200 --> 02:17:03,319
with a clear head and say okay well this

3603
02:17:01,920 --> 02:17:05,120
thing isn't doing what it says it's

3604
02:17:03,319 --> 02:17:06,599
doing but it's probably doing something

3605
02:17:05,120 --> 02:17:07,880
and the thing it's doing might be useful

3606
02:17:06,599 --> 02:17:09,679
but we should figure out what that thing

3607
02:17:07,880 --> 02:17:11,439
is so that's been really useful to me as

3608
02:17:09,679 --> 02:17:13,399
a guide to thinking the other thing he

3609
02:17:11,439 --> 02:17:15,160
said was if you want to build a big

3610
02:17:13,399 --> 02:17:17,719
system that works start with by building

3611
02:17:15,160 --> 02:17:19,519
a small system that works and scale it

3612
02:17:17,719 --> 02:17:21,760
and we've done that for example with the

3613
02:17:19,519 --> 02:17:24,080
self-authoring programs has built small

3614
02:17:21,760 --> 02:17:25,599
scale systems that are very robust with

3615
02:17:24,080 --> 02:17:27,519
the hope that they'll scale and that's

3616
02:17:25,599 --> 02:17:31,960
the same we'll do the same thing here is

3617
02:17:27,519 --> 02:17:33,760
start with a small amount of content see

3618
02:17:31,960 --> 02:17:35,399
if we can reward see what I would like

3619
02:17:33,760 --> 02:17:36,639
to have happen is you know there's a lot

3620
02:17:35,399 --> 02:17:38,800
of people out there who are pretty

3621
02:17:36,639 --> 02:17:41,359
intensely educated and some of them are

3622
02:17:38,800 --> 02:17:43,439
really creative and so imagine that

3623
02:17:41,359 --> 02:17:45,200
there's a timeline imagine you could we

3624
02:17:43,439 --> 02:17:48,040
do a Humanities issue imagine there's a

3625
02:17:45,200 --> 02:17:51,000
timeline say of a thousand years that's

3626
02:17:48,040 --> 02:17:53,040
scalable then imagine that that there

3627
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:54,280
would be lectures associated with the

3628
02:17:53,040 --> 02:17:56,120
timeline at different levels of

3629
02:17:54,280 --> 02:17:59,240
resolution so we might call for a

3630
02:17:56,120 --> 02:18:01,800
lecture on uh this the third Century a

3631
02:17:59,240 --> 02:18:03,800
ad what happened in the 3D Century ad

3632
02:18:01,800 --> 02:18:05,240
you've got half an hour to explain it

3633
02:18:03,800 --> 02:18:07,439
you can explain it any way you want you

3634
02:18:05,240 --> 02:18:09,800
can use animation you can use lecture

3635
02:18:07,439 --> 02:18:12,280
you can use text you can make a movie we

3636
02:18:09,800 --> 02:18:14,479
don't care what you have to do is that's

3637
02:18:12,280 --> 02:18:16,639
the topic that's the time span that's

3638
02:18:14,479 --> 02:18:19,559
the amount of time and then you can post

3639
02:18:16,639 --> 02:18:21,559
it and so we could generate content that

3640
02:18:19,559 --> 02:18:24,599
way and let people experiment and then

3641
02:18:21,559 --> 02:18:27,000
we can have people review the content as

3642
02:18:24,599 --> 02:18:28,760
part of their education generate

3643
02:18:27,000 --> 02:18:31,160
questions about the content as part of

3644
02:18:28,760 --> 02:18:33,519
their assignments rate the questions as

3645
02:18:31,160 --> 02:18:36,040
part of their assignments and rate the

3646
02:18:33,519 --> 02:18:37,960
content and then if we charge people

3647
02:18:36,040 --> 02:18:40,080
imagine you had to pay $50 a month to

3648
02:18:37,960 --> 02:18:43,240
enroll something like that maybe we

3649
02:18:40,080 --> 02:18:46,840
would allow you when you first enroll

3650
02:18:43,240 --> 02:18:48,800
maybe you get to use $5 of it as

3651
02:18:46,840 --> 02:18:51,000
disposable income you can reward that to

3652
02:18:48,800 --> 02:18:53,399
any Creator you want but as you progress

3653
02:18:51,000 --> 02:18:55,439
through the courses your right to

3654
02:18:53,399 --> 02:18:57,479
determine where your money goes would

3655
02:18:55,439 --> 02:18:59,240
increase as you became more and more

3656
02:18:57,479 --> 02:19:01,200
educated hopefully that way we would get

3657
02:18:59,240 --> 02:19:03,000
some quality control built into it so

3658
02:19:01,200 --> 02:19:04,800
those are some of the ideas that we're

3659
02:19:03,000 --> 02:19:07,160
that we're starting to play around with

3660
02:19:04,800 --> 02:19:08,960
so the only one I'm consider about is

3661
02:19:07,160 --> 02:19:12,559
the motivation what's that the

3662
02:19:08,960 --> 02:19:15,040
motivation issue for individuals um well

3663
02:19:12,559 --> 02:19:17,080
that I'm not going to go into that

3664
02:19:15,040 --> 02:19:18,880
because it would take too long but but

3665
02:19:17,080 --> 02:19:20,800
rest assured that we are thinking about

3666
02:19:18,880 --> 02:19:22,559
that very hard as well we're going to

3667
02:19:20,800 --> 02:19:24,359
build competition into it we're going to

3668
02:19:22,559 --> 02:19:26,960
build cooperation into it we hope to

3669
02:19:24,359 --> 02:19:28,960
build peer inter relationships into it I

3670
02:19:26,960 --> 02:19:30,920
think all that's possible but but

3671
02:19:28,960 --> 02:19:34,160
complex right because it's we don't know

3672
02:19:30,920 --> 02:19:36,399
how to build an online education system

3673
02:19:34,160 --> 02:19:37,840
really and but it would be fun to

3674
02:19:36,399 --> 02:19:42,479
experiment and see if we can figure out

3675
02:19:37,840 --> 02:19:42,479
how to do it so thank you thank

3676
02:19:45,319 --> 02:19:52,720
you hi uh so I I couldn't really um zero

3677
02:19:51,000 --> 02:19:54,160
in on any particular question so it's

3678
02:19:52,720 --> 02:19:56,439
more of a family questions that I have

3679
02:19:54,160 --> 02:19:58,840
about the nature and cultivation of

3680
02:19:56,439 --> 02:20:02,280
conscience which was in a sense what the

3681
02:19:58,840 --> 02:20:04,120
story uh exemplified about Abraham why

3682
02:20:02,280 --> 02:20:05,479
why do you say that why do you think

3683
02:20:04,120 --> 02:20:08,080
that the story exemplified the

3684
02:20:05,479 --> 02:20:10,479
development of cons of conscience spe

3685
02:20:08,080 --> 02:20:12,840
specifically well uh going back to the

3686
02:20:10,479 --> 02:20:14,200
zigzag yeah right and the star how you

3687
02:20:12,840 --> 02:20:16,600
have to keep okay so that's what you

3688
02:20:14,200 --> 02:20:19,359
were referring to orienting yourself

3689
02:20:16,600 --> 02:20:23,120
completely autonomously on your own

3690
02:20:19,359 --> 02:20:24,720
terms right yeah uh to uh okay so you

3691
02:20:23,120 --> 02:20:26,880
you hit on something great there I think

3692
02:20:24,720 --> 02:20:28,920
you know and this is something weirdly

3693
02:20:26,880 --> 02:20:30,760
enough that I learned most particularly

3694
02:20:28,920 --> 02:20:33,439
from the Pinocchio movie which I spent a

3695
02:20:30,760 --> 02:20:36,000
lot of time studying is because in in

3696
02:20:33,439 --> 02:20:38,160
the Pinocchio movie Jiminy Cricut is an

3697
02:20:36,000 --> 02:20:39,920
avatar of Christ essentially but it's

3698
02:20:38,160 --> 02:20:42,040
very strange because he's a bug that's

3699
02:20:39,920 --> 02:20:43,640
the first thing that's kind of weird and

3700
02:20:42,040 --> 02:20:45,439
because Jiminy cricet is Southern us

3701
02:20:43,640 --> 02:20:47,479
slang for Jesus Christ among other

3702
02:20:45,439 --> 02:20:50,240
things but and and these things get

3703
02:20:47,479 --> 02:20:51,520
aggregated in in in great Mythic dramas

3704
02:20:50,240 --> 02:20:53,240
like that and that's a great Mythic

3705
02:20:51,520 --> 02:20:55,439
drama but you know one of the things

3706
02:20:53,240 --> 02:20:56,960
that really makes Jiminy cricet

3707
02:20:55,439 --> 02:20:59,399
different from Christ apart from the

3708
02:20:56,960 --> 02:21:02,800
fact that Christ wasn't a cricket is

3709
02:20:59,399 --> 02:21:04,680
that the cricket learns as he progresses

3710
02:21:02,800 --> 02:21:06,040
right even though he's the conscience

3711
02:21:04,680 --> 02:21:07,920
and so you'd think that he would be the

3712
02:21:06,040 --> 02:21:09,479
infallible guide that isn't how the

3713
02:21:07,920 --> 02:21:12,200
movie makers set it up and that's so

3714
02:21:09,479 --> 02:21:14,200
cool is that he's just as muddle-headed

3715
02:21:12,200 --> 02:21:17,640
as Pinocchio at the beginning and he's a

3716
02:21:14,200 --> 02:21:19,200
bit arrogant and puffed up too and so

3717
02:21:17,640 --> 02:21:21,000
took me a long time to think that

3718
02:21:19,200 --> 02:21:24,080
through and then I realized that well

3719
02:21:21,000 --> 02:21:26,120
you you have the voice of you have the

3720
02:21:24,080 --> 02:21:28,920
voice of culture in you you have the

3721
02:21:26,120 --> 02:21:31,040
voice of culture within you but it's old

3722
02:21:28,920 --> 02:21:33,680
and dead and out of date and it's not

3723
02:21:31,040 --> 02:21:35,600
fully articulated and updated and then

3724
02:21:33,680 --> 02:21:38,840
what happens is that if you enter into a

3725
02:21:35,600 --> 02:21:41,040
dialogue with it and you Hammer yourself

3726
02:21:38,840 --> 02:21:43,760
against the world then you get hammered

3727
02:21:41,040 --> 02:21:46,920
into shape and so does your conscience

3728
02:21:43,760 --> 02:21:49,319
and so you both become elevated and so

3729
02:21:46,920 --> 02:21:51,680
well so anyways I think that's that's

3730
02:21:49,319 --> 02:21:53,000
ridiculously cool because means that

3731
02:21:51,680 --> 02:21:54,640
your conscience you don't have an

3732
02:21:53,000 --> 02:21:56,120
infallible guide but you have something

3733
02:21:54,640 --> 02:21:58,399
within you that you could build into an

3734
02:21:56,120 --> 02:22:02,600
infallible guide if you cooperated with

3735
02:21:58,399 --> 02:22:04,680
it and and fed it so well so I I think

3736
02:22:02,600 --> 02:22:06,880
that's very interesting so that being

3737
02:22:04,680 --> 02:22:09,080
said uh yeah the picture that I have in

3738
02:22:06,880 --> 02:22:10,720
my mind of um uh the cultivation of

3739
02:22:09,080 --> 02:22:13,080
virtue in general it's kind of like

3740
02:22:10,720 --> 02:22:15,439
taking a a block of wood and trying to

3741
02:22:13,080 --> 02:22:17,200
carve out a sphere out of it it'll never

3742
02:22:15,439 --> 02:22:19,160
be perfectly round but the more you

3743
02:22:17,200 --> 02:22:21,399
carve right the rounder and rounder

3744
02:22:19,160 --> 02:22:24,399
right that's successive appro o imation

3745
02:22:21,399 --> 02:22:26,960
yeah well one of it's It's also like U

3746
02:22:24,399 --> 02:22:28,280
what do you call that compound interest

3747
02:22:26,960 --> 02:22:30,760
this is one of the things that's also

3748
02:22:28,280 --> 02:22:33,359
and I think this puts you on the to

3749
02:22:30,760 --> 02:22:36,760
Those whom more shall be given part of

3750
02:22:33,359 --> 02:22:39,359
the curve it's like you know you don't

3751
02:22:36,760 --> 02:22:42,399
have to improve yourself very much each

3752
02:22:39,359 --> 02:22:44,720
week to really improve yourself on

3753
02:22:42,399 --> 02:22:46,640
ridiculous amount in a year you know so

3754
02:22:44,720 --> 02:22:50,000
you could make you could you could you

3755
02:22:46,640 --> 02:22:52,640
could vow to make your day one 100th of

3756
02:22:50,000 --> 02:22:54,560
a per better than the day before and

3757
02:22:52,640 --> 02:22:57,840
that would do the trick if you were if

3758
02:22:54,560 --> 02:23:00,120
you were constant about that that would

3759
02:22:57,840 --> 02:23:02,240
do the trick so that that's this success

3760
02:23:00,120 --> 02:23:03,840
of approximation is you you don't want

3761
02:23:02,240 --> 02:23:06,319
to underestimate the utility of

3762
02:23:03,840 --> 02:23:09,840
incremental progress man it's really

3763
02:23:06,319 --> 02:23:12,240
it's deadly powerful so so so let's say

3764
02:23:09,840 --> 02:23:14,120
you get to the um you know the higher

3765
02:23:12,240 --> 02:23:16,800
ends of the curve right you're like a

3766
02:23:14,120 --> 02:23:19,160
pretty virtuous person um let's say you

3767
02:23:16,800 --> 02:23:21,560
even become a sage or something of the

3768
02:23:19,160 --> 02:23:22,880
sort and

3769
02:23:21,560 --> 02:23:25,600
I

3770
02:23:22,880 --> 02:23:27,960
mean when should you doubt your

3771
02:23:25,600 --> 02:23:29,880
conscience like what are things that we

3772
02:23:27,960 --> 02:23:33,560
should watch out for even when we that's

3773
02:23:29,880 --> 02:23:36,359
great well that's yep okay um Ju Just to

3774
02:23:33,560 --> 02:23:39,080
get it out of the way right yeah um I

3775
02:23:36,359 --> 02:23:41,880
don't know how much this relates well it

3776
02:23:39,080 --> 02:23:43,560
does relate but Psychopaths for example

3777
02:23:41,880 --> 02:23:45,920
the entire idea that they lack a

3778
02:23:43,560 --> 02:23:48,760
conscience and that's why right that's

3779
02:23:45,920 --> 02:23:51,160
what psychopathy is um whether or not

3780
02:23:48,760 --> 02:23:52,920
you agree with that def definition right

3781
02:23:51,160 --> 02:23:56,720
but there's an issue of conscience again

3782
02:23:52,920 --> 02:24:01,359
at play with psychopathy um how can

3783
02:23:56,720 --> 02:24:02,960
we the first question uh doubt ourselves

3784
02:24:01,359 --> 02:24:04,920
in a way that's warranted right

3785
02:24:02,960 --> 02:24:06,680
regardless of how virtuous we've become

3786
02:24:04,920 --> 02:24:10,520
yes

3787
02:24:06,680 --> 02:24:12,840
and can you treat a psychopath could

3788
02:24:10,520 --> 02:24:14,760
they cultivate a conscience okay so let

3789
02:24:12,840 --> 02:24:17,600
we'll start with the first one part of

3790
02:24:14,760 --> 02:24:21,279
the reason that that I believe that

3791
02:24:17,600 --> 02:24:23,680
freedom of speech is the canonical

3792
02:24:21,279 --> 02:24:26,760
right let's and obligation right more

3793
02:24:23,680 --> 02:24:29,399
importantly even obligation is that

3794
02:24:26,760 --> 02:24:31,800
that's how you figure out if you're

3795
02:24:29,399 --> 02:24:33,319
wrong you know because so I sit home and

3796
02:24:31,800 --> 02:24:36,800
I think and I think and I think let's

3797
02:24:33,319 --> 02:24:38,560
say but I'm like who am I to think

3798
02:24:36,800 --> 02:24:41,560
there's so many things I don't know that

3799
02:24:38,560 --> 02:24:43,840
it's it's just there's the what I know

3800
02:24:41,560 --> 02:24:45,399
compared to what I don't know is

3801
02:24:43,840 --> 02:24:48,680
so

3802
02:24:45,399 --> 02:24:51,080
minuscule that it's a Preposterous act

3803
02:24:48,680 --> 02:24:53,120
just to say something

3804
02:24:51,080 --> 02:24:54,560
okay so so no matter how much I sit at

3805
02:24:53,120 --> 02:24:55,800
home and think I'm not going to fix that

3806
02:24:54,560 --> 02:24:57,600
I'm going to be full and then I have

3807
02:24:55,800 --> 02:24:59,800
biases but my temperament and I have

3808
02:24:57,600 --> 02:25:03,000
biases because of my malevolence and I

3809
02:24:59,800 --> 02:25:05,600
have biases because of my my gender my

3810
02:25:03,000 --> 02:25:07,640
sex let's say since we're not so fond of

3811
02:25:05,600 --> 02:25:10,560
that word

3812
02:25:07,640 --> 02:25:12,840
um so IFA no matter how much I sit home

3813
02:25:10,560 --> 02:25:13,520
and think I'm still going to be wrong

3814
02:25:12,840 --> 02:25:15,760
and

3815
02:25:13,520 --> 02:25:17,520
malevolent so then what I have to do is

3816
02:25:15,760 --> 02:25:18,439
I have to talk to some other people and

3817
02:25:17,520 --> 02:25:21,680
I have to

3818
02:25:18,439 --> 02:25:26,279
say this is what I

3819
02:25:21,680 --> 02:25:29,560
think and it's going to be ugly you know

3820
02:25:26,279 --> 02:25:31,680
because what the hell do I know but then

3821
02:25:29,560 --> 02:25:35,000
if I

3822
02:25:31,680 --> 02:25:36,680
listen people will tell me why I'm wrong

3823
02:25:35,000 --> 02:25:39,160
and lots of people have been telling me

3824
02:25:36,680 --> 02:25:42,040
why I'm wrong like a lot and it's hard

3825
02:25:39,160 --> 02:25:45,080
you know it's hard but it's but I've

3826
02:25:42,040 --> 02:25:47,760
learned something from it like I I had

3827
02:25:45,080 --> 02:25:50,439
this Revelation let's say about being

3828
02:25:47,760 --> 02:25:52,160
yelled at by your father now I know that

3829
02:25:50,439 --> 02:25:56,399
you can be yelled at too much by your

3830
02:25:52,160 --> 02:25:57,880
father but it's like you're wrong man

3831
02:25:56,399 --> 02:26:00,720
and so someone's yelling at you and

3832
02:25:57,880 --> 02:26:03,479
maybe they're only 10% right but if you

3833
02:26:00,720 --> 02:26:05,920
shut the hell up and listen then you can

3834
02:26:03,479 --> 02:26:07,319
figure out where you're wrong and then

3835
02:26:05,920 --> 02:26:10,080
maybe you can be thankful for that and

3836
02:26:07,319 --> 02:26:12,040
then maybe if you shut up and listened

3837
02:26:10,080 --> 02:26:13,520
your father would quit yelling at you

3838
02:26:12,040 --> 02:26:15,080
you know because he's wrong too what the

3839
02:26:13,520 --> 02:26:17,200
hell does he know he knows how to yell

3840
02:26:15,080 --> 02:26:18,960
at you and tell you how you're wrong and

3841
02:26:17,200 --> 02:26:20,800
he's throwing things out you at you that

3842
02:26:18,960 --> 02:26:22,439
are probably not true

3843
02:26:20,800 --> 02:26:24,680
but some of it's

3844
02:26:22,439 --> 02:26:26,240
true and you know if someone can tell

3845
02:26:24,680 --> 02:26:29,040
you why you're wrong they've given you a

3846
02:26:26,240 --> 02:26:30,439
great gift because then you don't have

3847
02:26:29,040 --> 02:26:32,279
to be wrong anymore and you might think

3848
02:26:30,439 --> 02:26:34,279
well who cares if you're wrong but you

3849
02:26:32,279 --> 02:26:37,080
know there's a line in the New Testament

3850
02:26:34,279 --> 02:26:39,000
too is if the blind lead the blind won't

3851
02:26:37,080 --> 02:26:40,920
they fall in won't they fall into a

3852
02:26:39,000 --> 02:26:44,120
ditch the answer to that question by the

3853
02:26:40,920 --> 02:26:45,880
way is yes they will and so the reason

3854
02:26:44,120 --> 02:26:47,200
that you want to think is because

3855
02:26:45,880 --> 02:26:51,880
thinking is how

3856
02:26:47,200 --> 02:26:53,439
you like when you think you create a

3857
02:26:51,880 --> 02:26:55,000
a fictional world that's that's an

3858
02:26:53,439 --> 02:26:57,520
analog of the world and then you make an

3859
02:26:55,000 --> 02:26:59,359
avatar of yourself to act in that world

3860
02:26:57,520 --> 02:27:02,040
and then if the Avatar dies you don't

3861
02:26:59,359 --> 02:27:05,439
act out those actions right well so if

3862
02:27:02,040 --> 02:27:07,399
you think properly then you don't have

3863
02:27:05,439 --> 02:27:09,319
to suffer and die and so if you can say

3864
02:27:07,399 --> 02:27:11,560
what you think and people can tell you

3865
02:27:09,319 --> 02:27:13,160
why you're wrong and you know to say

3866
02:27:11,560 --> 02:27:14,640
what you think under extreme

3867
02:27:13,160 --> 02:27:16,479
circumstances means that you're going to

3868
02:27:14,640 --> 02:27:17,680
say things that no one wants to hear

3869
02:27:16,479 --> 02:27:19,000
because those are the things you don't

3870
02:27:17,680 --> 02:27:20,720
know about those are the things that are

3871
02:27:19,000 --> 02:27:22,479
conflictual and difficult

3872
02:27:20,720 --> 02:27:24,200
those are going to be hard conversations

3873
02:27:22,479 --> 02:27:26,279
man and you're going to be wrong about

3874
02:27:24,200 --> 02:27:27,880
them a lot if you don't get to stumble

3875
02:27:26,279 --> 02:27:30,960
forward with your

3876
02:27:27,880 --> 02:27:33,479
stupidity then you can't be corrected

3877
02:27:30,960 --> 02:27:35,319
and so so there's no distinction between

3878
02:27:33,479 --> 02:27:36,800
free speech and thinking and there's no

3879
02:27:35,319 --> 02:27:38,640
distinction between thinking and

3880
02:27:36,800 --> 02:27:41,640
thriving and so those who want to

3881
02:27:38,640 --> 02:27:47,840
inhibit Free Speech do not wish for

3882
02:27:41,640 --> 02:27:50,560
people to thrive and I believe that

3883
02:27:47,840 --> 02:27:53,080
so thinking does not happen in inside

3884
02:27:50,560 --> 02:27:55,279
your head that's only the beginnings of

3885
02:27:53,080 --> 02:27:58,880
thinking and it's this that we're doing

3886
02:27:55,279 --> 02:28:01,279
here that's thinking you know so we have

3887
02:27:58,880 --> 02:28:03,200
to protect that

3888
02:28:01,279 --> 02:28:06,359
Psychopaths I

3889
02:28:03,200 --> 02:28:08,640
don't I say this I hope non-

3890
02:28:06,359 --> 02:28:10,920
naively also having dealt with

3891
02:28:08,640 --> 02:28:13,520
psychopaths in my clinical practice and

3892
02:28:10,920 --> 02:28:15,359
I would say now and then in my life I

3893
02:28:13,520 --> 02:28:17,800
don't believe in

3894
02:28:15,359 --> 02:28:20,439
Psychopaths I don't believe that we know

3895
02:28:17,800 --> 02:28:21,760
enough to say there are people born

3896
02:28:20,439 --> 02:28:24,680
without

3897
02:28:21,760 --> 02:28:26,840
conscience um I don't think the

3898
02:28:24,680 --> 02:28:28,680
psychometric measurement of psychopathy

3899
02:28:26,840 --> 02:28:30,520
is everything that it should be I've

3900
02:28:28,680 --> 02:28:33,160
been trying to model it B in the big

3901
02:28:30,520 --> 02:28:35,279
five domain I think now it's complicated

3902
02:28:33,160 --> 02:28:37,399
because so I would say a psychopath a

3903
02:28:35,279 --> 02:28:40,520
classic psychopath is likely extroverted

3904
02:28:37,399 --> 02:28:43,720
especially assertive disagreeable and

3905
02:28:40,520 --> 02:28:45,560
unconscientious and maybe extremely low

3906
02:28:43,720 --> 02:28:49,279
in neuroticism so you can't frighten

3907
02:28:45,560 --> 02:28:51,640
them but so that's a rare combination

3908
02:28:49,279 --> 02:28:54,080
because it's extreme many traits right

3909
02:28:51,640 --> 02:28:55,560
but that I don't believe that that means

3910
02:28:54,080 --> 02:28:58,960
that someone with that personality

3911
02:28:55,560 --> 02:29:00,600
configuration is doomed from birth to a

3912
02:28:58,960 --> 02:29:03,760
pathological existence because there's

3913
02:29:00,600 --> 02:29:05,920
things about psychopathy that that the

3914
02:29:03,760 --> 02:29:08,200
that the classifiers those who claim

3915
02:29:05,920 --> 02:29:12,439
like clly that the psychopath is born in

3916
02:29:08,200 --> 02:29:13,760
some sense can't explain it's like well

3917
02:29:12,439 --> 02:29:16,279
what about the

3918
02:29:13,760 --> 02:29:18,120
cruelty there seems to be a motive there

3919
02:29:16,279 --> 02:29:20,840
you know they're passionless and they

3920
02:29:18,120 --> 02:29:23,479
lack no they lack emotion well

3921
02:29:20,840 --> 02:29:26,279
why are they cruel then for

3922
02:29:23,479 --> 02:29:28,560
entertainment well but then you have to

3923
02:29:26,279 --> 02:29:30,200
explain the entertainment motivation

3924
02:29:28,560 --> 02:29:32,200
like there's a failure in some sense

3925
02:29:30,200 --> 02:29:34,279
with the classic psychopathy theorist to

3926
02:29:32,200 --> 02:29:36,600
come to grips with the problem of

3927
02:29:34,279 --> 02:29:38,160
malevolence it's skirted over and you

3928
02:29:36,600 --> 02:29:39,840
can't do that if you're talking about

3929
02:29:38,160 --> 02:29:43,080
psychopathy it's like malevolence is the

3930
02:29:39,840 --> 02:29:45,479
bloody issue here and

3931
02:29:43,080 --> 02:29:47,359
so the other issue with the psychopath

3932
02:29:45,479 --> 02:29:50,399
is that he's irredeemable right that's

3933
02:29:47,359 --> 02:29:51,800
the idea

3934
02:29:50,399 --> 02:29:54,359
I don't think we know enough to make

3935
02:29:51,800 --> 02:29:56,000
such claims now and that doesn't I know

3936
02:29:54,359 --> 02:29:57,760
the psychopathy literature quite well

3937
02:29:56,000 --> 02:29:59,479
and I have great respect for the primary

3938
02:29:57,760 --> 02:30:01,319
researchers in the field I want to make

3939
02:29:59,479 --> 02:30:03,279
that perfectly clear but we're talking

3940
02:30:01,319 --> 02:30:04,720
at a different we're talking we're

3941
02:30:03,279 --> 02:30:06,359
approaching the problem from a different

3942
02:30:04,720 --> 02:30:08,840
level of analysis here something like a

3943
02:30:06,359 --> 02:30:10,359
spiritual level of analysis and I don't

3944
02:30:08,840 --> 02:30:12,720
think that there's an easy easy

3945
02:30:10,359 --> 02:30:16,120
translation from the descriptive

3946
02:30:12,720 --> 02:30:19,200
psychometric psychiatric approach to the

3947
02:30:16,120 --> 02:30:22,200
spiritual level they don't match and I'm

3948
02:30:19,200 --> 02:30:25,680
more likely to say let's not assume the

3949
02:30:22,200 --> 02:30:28,359
soul is doomed from birth right and I'm

3950
02:30:25,680 --> 02:30:29,920
I'm loathed to think that there are

3951
02:30:28,359 --> 02:30:31,920
people born

3952
02:30:29,920 --> 02:30:34,880
irredeemable although I do think there

3953
02:30:31,920 --> 02:30:36,520
are irredeemable people you know the the

3954
02:30:34,880 --> 02:30:38,680
death penalty issue is interesting in

3955
02:30:36,520 --> 02:30:41,560
that regard you know because I've read a

3956
02:30:38,680 --> 02:30:43,439
lot about really terrible people and

3957
02:30:41,560 --> 02:30:45,439
I've also read a lot about what really

3958
02:30:43,439 --> 02:30:47,800
terrible people said about themselves

3959
02:30:45,439 --> 02:30:50,200
and many of them wished for the death

3960
02:30:47,800 --> 02:30:52,160
penalty and so it's absolutely clear

3961
02:30:50,200 --> 02:30:54,319
that there are things that you can do

3962
02:30:52,160 --> 02:30:56,359
that deserve the death

3963
02:30:54,319 --> 02:30:58,520
penalty but that doesn't mean that the

3964
02:30:56,359 --> 02:31:01,600
state should have the right to impose it

3965
02:30:58,520 --> 02:31:04,600
that's a different question

3966
02:31:01,600 --> 02:31:04,600
so

3967
02:31:08,560 --> 02:31:12,880
yeah in the previous lecture you

3968
02:31:10,760 --> 02:31:14,120
mentioned the 2008 economic crisis and

3969
02:31:12,880 --> 02:31:15,680
one of the very interesting themes

3970
02:31:14,120 --> 02:31:17,920
that's emerged at many levels be it

3971
02:31:15,680 --> 02:31:19,920
universities or economic policies this

3972
02:31:17,920 --> 02:31:21,880
perceived culture War specifically the

3973
02:31:19,920 --> 02:31:23,640
the idea of Marx versus Mill and you've

3974
02:31:21,880 --> 02:31:25,560
criticized postmodern and Neo Marxist

3975
02:31:23,640 --> 02:31:27,880
thought very frequently one interesting

3976
02:31:25,560 --> 02:31:30,520
critic of uh the policies of the EU

3977
02:31:27,880 --> 02:31:32,960
specifically EC ECB and IMF during the

3978
02:31:30,520 --> 02:31:35,560
Greek debt crisis was Janis vakas the

3979
02:31:32,960 --> 02:31:37,399
former Greek Finance Minister and his

3980
02:31:35,560 --> 02:31:39,439
criticism of Mill was the was Mill's

3981
02:31:37,399 --> 02:31:41,160
alleged contempt for the population and

3982
02:31:39,439 --> 02:31:43,520
vaca's comments on the type of

3983
02:31:41,160 --> 02:31:45,880
capitalism that results in too big to

3984
02:31:43,520 --> 02:31:47,680
fail he describes himself as an erratic

3985
02:31:45,880 --> 02:31:49,319
Marxist to me personally he's an example

3986
02:31:47,680 --> 02:31:51,640
of someone whose position on the

3987
02:31:49,319 --> 02:31:53,279
philosophical moing of policy is

3988
02:31:51,640 --> 02:31:55,479
interesting to compare and contrast with

3989
02:31:53,279 --> 02:31:56,960
yours he's certainly not your typical

3990
02:31:55,479 --> 02:31:58,439
Marxist or postmodernist even though I'm

3991
02:31:56,960 --> 02:31:59,640
not really sure what that means but if

3992
02:31:58,439 --> 02:32:01,279
you look at his work during the Greek

3993
02:31:59,640 --> 02:32:04,000
debt crisis and his current work with

3994
02:32:01,279 --> 02:32:06,080
dm25 he seems to be well reasoned well

3995
02:32:04,000 --> 02:32:07,680
positioned and and and articulate now I

3996
02:32:06,080 --> 02:32:09,640
wanted to know if you had an opinion on

3997
02:32:07,680 --> 02:32:11,359
that type of criticism of Mill or his

3998
02:32:09,640 --> 02:32:16,680
taking of a position as an erratic

3999
02:32:11,359 --> 02:32:19,279
Marxist okay I would say I would say no

4000
02:32:16,680 --> 02:32:22,439
to the specifics of of the question I

4001
02:32:19,279 --> 02:32:24,600
don't think that I have the detailed

4002
02:32:22,439 --> 02:32:26,520
expertise in order to answer the

4003
02:32:24,600 --> 02:32:30,399
question at the level of analysis that

4004
02:32:26,520 --> 02:32:32,240
you where you formulated it but I I have

4005
02:32:30,399 --> 02:32:34,120
something to say that's more General

4006
02:32:32,240 --> 02:32:37,399
about the set of phenomena that you

4007
02:32:34,120 --> 02:32:40,000
described there's no doubt that

4008
02:32:37,399 --> 02:32:44,359
distribution is a major problem that

4009
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:46,760
capitalism contends with imperfectly at

4010
02:32:44,359 --> 02:32:48,760
best and the distribution problem is the

4011
02:32:46,760 --> 02:32:50,640
predo distribution problem right and and

4012
02:32:48,760 --> 02:32:52,520
something that Marx commented on which

4013
02:32:50,640 --> 02:32:54,279
mostly in the monetary sphere is that

4014
02:32:52,520 --> 02:32:56,319
money tends to accumulate in the hands

4015
02:32:54,279 --> 02:32:58,960
of very few people it's like there's no

4016
02:32:56,319 --> 02:33:01,479
doubt about that now as we've discussed

4017
02:32:58,960 --> 02:33:03,880
before the people in whom hands the

4018
02:33:01,479 --> 02:33:07,800
money accumulates do turn over more than

4019
02:33:03,880 --> 02:33:09,319
people say think especially in in in

4020
02:33:07,800 --> 02:33:10,600
countries that are functioning

4021
02:33:09,319 --> 02:33:12,080
reasonably well and it's really

4022
02:33:10,600 --> 02:33:16,000
important that that

4023
02:33:12,080 --> 02:33:19,920
happens yes yes yes but that

4024
02:33:16,000 --> 02:33:23,040
doesn't that doesn't solve the problem

4025
02:33:19,920 --> 02:33:25,200
of the fact that produced Goods

4026
02:33:23,040 --> 02:33:26,920
gravitate towards an extreme minority

4027
02:33:25,200 --> 02:33:30,040
now they're also produced Often by

4028
02:33:26,920 --> 02:33:31,960
extreme minority which is also a problem

4029
02:33:30,040 --> 02:33:35,680
um I would

4030
02:33:31,960 --> 02:33:37,359
say then that the idea that capitalism

4031
02:33:35,680 --> 02:33:40,720
is more prone

4032
02:33:37,359 --> 02:33:43,439
to that distribution problem than any

4033
02:33:40,720 --> 02:33:46,120
other system I don't believe that to

4034
02:33:43,439 --> 02:33:48,000
have been demonstrated at all and I

4035
02:33:46,120 --> 02:33:50,359
think that capitalism is actually pretty

4036
02:33:48,000 --> 02:33:52,359
good at self-destruction except when

4037
02:33:50,359 --> 02:33:53,920
that's interfered with and I think

4038
02:33:52,359 --> 02:33:57,439
that's particularly the case in the

4039
02:33:53,920 --> 02:34:00,520
United States where generally the policy

4040
02:33:57,439 --> 02:34:02,680
has been if you're an idol with feet of

4041
02:34:00,520 --> 02:34:05,600
clay no matter how big you are you get

4042
02:34:02,680 --> 02:34:08,399
to fail now that's been compromised

4043
02:34:05,600 --> 02:34:10,880
severely in the last 20

4044
02:34:08,399 --> 02:34:12,680
years and we're probably going to pay

4045
02:34:10,880 --> 02:34:15,920
for that I think they really paid for

4046
02:34:12,680 --> 02:34:18,800
that in Japan right where there was

4047
02:34:15,920 --> 02:34:21,720
every attempt to prop out the the gods

4048
02:34:18,800 --> 02:34:21,720
that should have died

4049
02:34:22,960 --> 02:34:29,680
so so fair enough for the critique of

4050
02:34:27,080 --> 02:34:33,520
capitalism that's not the issue the

4051
02:34:29,680 --> 02:34:36,800
issue is do you have a better idea and

4052
02:34:33,520 --> 02:34:40,200
if the idea is well we could kind of do

4053
02:34:36,800 --> 02:34:43,560
what Mark suggested then you don't get

4054
02:34:40,200 --> 02:34:45,880
to have that position

4055
02:34:43,560 --> 02:34:48,000
and

4056
02:34:45,880 --> 02:34:50,880
claim what should I

4057
02:34:48,000 --> 02:34:53,600
say I haven't seen any evidence that

4058
02:34:50,880 --> 02:34:56,040
systems predicated on that set of axioms

4059
02:34:53,600 --> 02:34:58,680
have done anything but more harm than

4060
02:34:56,040 --> 02:35:00,279
good thank you yeah and when will you be

4061
02:34:58,680 --> 02:35:02,640
announcing the monthly extension to this

4062
02:35:00,279 --> 02:35:04,160
lecture series as soon as I find out

4063
02:35:02,640 --> 02:35:04,920
whether or not I can rent this theater

4064
02:35:04,160 --> 02:35:06,560
in the

4065
02:35:04,920 --> 02:35:11,980
fall

4066
02:35:06,560 --> 02:35:15,290
yeah thank you we'll see you next week

4067
02:35:11,980 --> 02:35:15,290
[Applause]
