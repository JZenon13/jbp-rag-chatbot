2
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:36,120
thank you very much

3
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:38,640
hahahaha thank you very much for showing

4
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:45,089
up again that's a really good to see

5
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:49,829
everybody here so one of the things that

6
00:00:45,089 --> 00:00:54,690
I've been realizing as a consequence of

7
00:00:49,829 --> 00:00:55,890
going through these stories is that the

8
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:58,620
degree to which they're about

9
00:00:55,890 --> 00:01:01,500
individuals is quite remarkable and I

10
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:03,180
think that's really telling you know one

11
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:05,820
of the reasons I prefer Dostoevsky to

12
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:08,729
Tolstoy is because Tolstoy is more of a

13
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:10,380
sociologist he's more interested in the

14
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:12,420
relationship between groups of people

15
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:14,340
this is an oversimplification because

16
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,979
obviously Tolstoy is a great author but

17
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:18,750
I like dusty husky better because he

18
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:20,640
really delves into the souls of

19
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:24,750
individuals and I think it's remarkable

20
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:27,829
the degree to which all of the stories

21
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:30,659
that we've covered so far in Genesis are

22
00:01:27,829 --> 00:01:32,729
about individuals and they're quite

23
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:34,859
realistic which is quite remarkable -

24
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:37,409
they're not really romanticized to any

25
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:39,359
great degree because all of the people

26
00:01:37,409 --> 00:01:41,299
that are regard as regarded let's say as

27
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:45,869
patriarchal or matriarchal figures in

28
00:01:41,299 --> 00:01:48,149
Genesis have no shortage of ethical if

29
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:49,710
no shortage of ethical flaws and also no

30
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:51,569
shortage of difficulties in their life

31
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:54,119
and the difficulties are realistic there

32
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:56,819
they're major-league problems you know

33
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:59,639
like familial catastrophes and famine

34
00:01:56,819 --> 00:02:01,200
and war and revenge and hatred and all

35
00:01:59,639 --> 00:02:04,740
those things it's not a it's not a

36
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,719
pretty it's not a pretty book and that's

37
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:08,009
one of the things that makes it great I

38
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,690
mean that's one of the things that

39
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:11,250
characterizes great literature right is

40
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:15,300
that it doesn't present you with a

41
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:18,000
whitewashed view of humanity or of

42
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:20,190
existence and that's really a relief I

43
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,530
think because as you all know because

44
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:26,280
you're alive there's no such thing as a

45
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:28,370
whitewash existence like you're to be

46
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:33,990
alive is to be in trouble

47
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:35,580
ethically and existentially I've been

48
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:37,260
reading this book recently

49
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:39,600
I'll talk about it a little bit later

50
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:42,300
it's called better never to have a bean

51
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:45,180
and it was written by a philosopher

52
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:48,150
in South Africa in Cape Town name

53
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:52,230
Benatar that's his last name and he

54
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:54,300
basically argues I think it's a specious

55
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:57,410
argument and I think it's artificially

56
00:02:54,300 --> 00:03:00,350
constructed but he basically argues that

57
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:03,270
because life is so full of suffering

58
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:07,410
even good lives are very much full of

59
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:09,030
suffering that it's wrong to bring

60
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:11,010
children into the world because the

61
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:13,320
suffering outweighs the good even in

62
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:15,870
good lives and it's actually wrong it

63
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:19,320
would also be better not to exist for

64
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:20,940
exactly the same reason and my sense in

65
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:22,380
reading the book is that he came to that

66
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,600
conclusion and then wrote the book to

67
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:26,400
justify it which is actually the reverse

68
00:03:24,600 --> 00:03:28,050
of the way that you should write a book

69
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,520
what you should do when you're writing a

70
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:32,010
book is you should have a question and

71
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:33,150
you should it should be a real question

72
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:35,310
right it should be one you don't know

73
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:37,410
the answer to and then you should be

74
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:38,520
studying and writing like mad and

75
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:40,140
reading everything you can get your

76
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:42,210
hands on to see if you can actually

77
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:43,740
grapple with the problem and come to

78
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:46,410
some solution and you should walk the

79
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:48,510
reader as well through your process of

80
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:50,430
thinking so that they can come to the

81
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:51,959
well not necessary to the same

82
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:54,060
conclusion but at least track what

83
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:55,260
you're doing and I don't think that's

84
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:57,720
what he did I think he wrote it

85
00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:01,260
backwards but then and so I was thinking

86
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:03,900
about it a lot because that's actually a

87
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:07,380
question that I've contended with in my

88
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:09,510
writing there are Memphis da Philly and

89
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:13,050
our satanic figures for example in girth

90
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:15,540
is Faust and also Ivan in in that in the

91
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:17,489
brothers karamasoff who basically make

92
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:20,520
the same case you know that existence is

93
00:04:17,489 --> 00:04:23,250
so rife with trouble and suffering that

94
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:25,910
it would be better if it didn't exist at

95
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:28,350
all and the problem I've had with that

96
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:29,880
there's a variety of them but one of the

97
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:31,560
problems I've had with that is what

98
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,810
happens if you start to think that way

99
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,970
because what I've observed is that

100
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:38,520
people who begin to think that way that

101
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:39,960
isn't where they stop like that they get

102
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,520
angry at existence which is what

103
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,890
happened to Cain as we saw in the Cain

104
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,570
and Abel story and then the next step is

105
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:48,030
to start taking revenge against

106
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:50,100
existence and that cascades until it's

107
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:51,510
revenge against well I think the best

108
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:54,000
way of thinking about it is revenge

109
00:04:51,510 --> 00:04:55,560
against God for the crime of being which

110
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,030
is I think the deepest sort of hatred

111
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,150
that

112
00:04:56,030 --> 00:05:00,980
can entertain and and and when you're in

113
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:03,140
the grip of a really deep emotion like a

114
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:05,000
really profound emotion right at the

115
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:07,070
bottom of emotions you're in something

116
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,840
that's like a quasi-religious state and

117
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:10,880
that's more or less independent of your

118
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,950
belief saying a transcendent deity I

119
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,960
mean you can be in a profoundly

120
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:16,190
emotional state that's as deep as it can

121
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:17,780
be and it can have religious

122
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:19,820
significance without that necessarily

123
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:22,880
signifying anything about a transcendent

124
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:24,560
being you know but but then I was

125
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,350
thinking you see the problem with that

126
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:28,940
argument is you can gerrymander it

127
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:30,350
endlessly you know because first of all

128
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:31,910
how do you measure suffering and how do

129
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:34,010
you measure happiness it's like how do

130
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:35,720
you assign weights to them and god

131
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:39,110
there's just no way of doing that you

132
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:40,700
have to do it arbitrarily and so you can

133
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:42,140
make an argument that the suffering

134
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:43,610
outweighs the happiness you just wait

135
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:45,050
the suffering more heavily than you wait

136
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:47,290
the happiness and that's the end of that

137
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:50,780
you know and so that's that's a problem

138
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:54,410
but I think there's a deeper problem and

139
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:57,370
I was reading this other book while back

140
00:05:54,410 --> 00:06:01,430
as well which was written by the guy who

141
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:02,900
ran the human genome project and I don't

142
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:04,400
remember exactly what it was called but

143
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:07,190
it was something like a scientists case

144
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,650
for God is something like that and one

145
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:11,180
of the things he referred to which

146
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:14,780
didn't strike me as hard as it should

147
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:18,170
have to begin with was the he thought

148
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:20,390
that one of the phenomena say that

149
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:22,370
justified a belief in a transcendent

150
00:06:20,390 --> 00:06:24,650
being was something like the moral

151
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:26,530
intuition of human beings that you know

152
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:29,210
we have a sense of right and wrong and

153
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:30,800
you know it's certainly in what happens

154
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:34,640
in Genesis in the story of Adam and Eve

155
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:36,170
is that that that story announces the

156
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:37,670
coming of the sense of right and wrong

157
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:39,350
right the knowledge of good and evil and

158
00:06:37,670 --> 00:06:41,180
it isn't something we ascribe to animals

159
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:44,030
it's something that's unique to human

160
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:46,640
beings animals can be predators and you

161
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:48,110
know and they can be gentle and and you

162
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:50,510
can have a relationship with them but

163
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:52,280
you never think of an evil cat or you

164
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:56,540
know or an evil wolf even though they're

165
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:59,660
you know they're predatory about human

166
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:01,640
beings we have this capacity to judge

167
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:03,950
between good and evil right and wrong

168
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:06,170
and it's really an integral part of our

169
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:07,550
being and I think you can make an

170
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:09,790
evolutionary case for that a biological

171
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:13,000
case for that as you can

172
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:15,580
make a biological case for most of what

173
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:18,160
is relevant about human beings because

174
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:19,960
we're biological creatures but we don't

175
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,880
really understand the significance of

176
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:23,290
that like what happens in the story of

177
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:25,480
Adam and Eve is that that's that

178
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:27,130
realization not coming to the knowledge

179
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:29,380
of good and evil is actually represented

180
00:07:27,130 --> 00:07:31,780
as a shift of cosmic significance right

181
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:34,570
it puts a it puts a permanent fracture

182
00:07:31,780 --> 00:07:35,830
in the structure of being and you know

183
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:39,490
if you think of human beings as

184
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:41,730
insignificant ants on a tiny dust mote

185
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:45,490
in the middle of an infinite cosmos

186
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:47,650
cosmos that cares less for us then who

187
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:49,750
cares fundamentally if human beings have

188
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:51,520
the knowledge to distinguish between

189
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:53,650
good and evil but if you give

190
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,240
consciousness a central role in being

191
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:56,650
and you can make a perfectly reasonable

192
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:59,230
case for that because without

193
00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:02,020
consciousness there's no being as far as

194
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:05,200
anyone can determine so it may be much

195
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:06,370
more central than we think and and I

196
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:08,560
really don't think there's a

197
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:10,240
counter-argument to that like not a

198
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:12,190
solid one you can state that

199
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,480
consciousness is epiphenomena land and

200
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:15,370
that the world is fundamentally

201
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:17,140
materialistic and it doesn't matter that

202
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:19,150
there's consciousness you can state that

203
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:21,550
but you can make an equally credible

204
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:23,650
case the other way and certainly our

205
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:26,860
lived experience is that consciousness

206
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:28,810
is crucial obviously and we treat each

207
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:31,420
other as if most of the time we're

208
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:33,099
valuable conscious beings and we

209
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:34,479
wouldn't give up our consciousness even

210
00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:36,700
though it's often consciousness of

211
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:40,090
suffering and so then I think another

212
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:41,919
problem with the book is that it's it's

213
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:44,590
sort of predicated on the idea that life

214
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:46,060
is for happiness and I don't think

215
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:47,950
that's right and I don't think that's

216
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:51,820
how people experience life and I might

217
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:53,980
be wrong but it seems to me that people

218
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:57,340
experience life as something like a

219
00:08:53,980 --> 00:09:00,400
series of crucial ethical decisions it's

220
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:04,060
something like that I mean when I just

221
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:06,850
can't imagine maybe I'm being naive

222
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:10,420
about this but I can't imagine that I

223
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:13,510
can't imagine another being that's like

224
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:17,080
me in in most senses that isn't

225
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:19,900
constantly wrestling in some sense with

226
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:21,580
what the next proper thing to do is it's

227
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,840
not like it's obvious it's not bloody

228
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:24,520
obvious and it

229
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:26,950
doesn't mean you'll do the right thing

230
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:29,500
because you don't law lots of times and

231
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:30,850
you know that by your own judgement

232
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,330
right because you're making mistakes all

233
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:32,470
the time

234
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:33,850
sometimes you don't know what you're

235
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:36,010
doing and maybe it's a mistake and maybe

236
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:37,150
it isn't and who's to say that isn't

237
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:38,410
what I'm talking and what I'm talking

238
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:40,090
about when you know that what you're

239
00:09:38,410 --> 00:09:41,680
doing is wrong and you go ahead and do

240
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:44,260
it anyways people do that all the time

241
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,760
and that's also extremely peculiar you

242
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:47,800
bloody well think that if you knew it

243
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,210
was wrong and you told yourself that it

244
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:51,310
was wrong that that would be sufficient

245
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:52,930
so that you just wouldn't do it but that

246
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:54,550
isn't what you're like at all you know

247
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:56,620
and you can tell yourself something is

248
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:58,780
wrong a fifty times and you'll do it the

249
00:09:56,620 --> 00:10:01,360
51st time and then you'll feel you know

250
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:04,860
like like you deserve to feel probably

251
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:07,420
and but it doesn't stop you and so so

252
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:10,270
then I think the other problem with the

253
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:13,270
viewpoint the idea that the suffering of

254
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:16,150
life eradicate sits utility is that it's

255
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:19,000
predicated on the idea that happiness or

256
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:21,760
lack of suffering even is is the right

257
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:24,130
criteria by which to judge life and I

258
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,200
don't think that's how we actually

259
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:28,420
experience life I think what we do

260
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:32,740
instead is put ourselves through a

261
00:10:28,420 --> 00:10:34,210
series of excruciating moral choices you

262
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:37,030
know when one of the things that that's

263
00:10:34,210 --> 00:10:40,320
really significant about the biblical

264
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:44,050
stories and I think about the the entire

265
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:46,510
implicit philosophy you know that's

266
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:48,910
embedded in the stories is that that's

267
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:50,950
how life is presented in in the stories

268
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:52,510
is all of these individuals first

269
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:55,180
they're individuals - not groups and

270
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:57,430
second they're agonizing over their

271
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:59,890
moral choices all the time all the time

272
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:03,370
and they have a relationship with God

273
00:10:59,890 --> 00:11:07,000
and but it's not a it's not a directive

274
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:09,490
relationship exactly even for the people

275
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:11,290
to whom God speaks directly which I

276
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:15,850
suspect is not something you'd exactly

277
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:18,100
want to have happen is it's there's

278
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:19,930
still even the fact that they have a

279
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:21,490
direct relationship with God doesn't

280
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:23,730
stop them from being tormented

281
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:27,460
continually by their moral choices and

282
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:30,400
so the world is presented as a moral

283
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:33,190
landscape not as a not as a place that

284
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:34,810
justifies itself by happiness it's

285
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:36,490
presented as a moral landscape and

286
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:39,310
people are presented as

287
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:42,820
preachers who traverse through the moral

288
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:44,680
landscape making ethical decisions that

289
00:11:42,820 --> 00:11:47,170
determine the course of the world and

290
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:49,270
that seems to me to be right and that's

291
00:11:47,170 --> 00:11:51,220
not a that's not the same as happiness

292
00:11:49,270 --> 00:11:55,260
by any stretch of the imagination it's a

293
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:57,399
whole different category of being and

294
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:59,080
you know and then I thought that through

295
00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:01,870
a lot and I think well we do make

296
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:03,940
choices and what we do is contend with

297
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:05,740
the future you know and that the future

298
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:09,100
seems to appear to us as a realm of

299
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:10,690
possibility that's a more accurate way

300
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:13,029
of thinking about it then then that the

301
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:16,779
future presents itself to it to us as a

302
00:12:13,029 --> 00:12:18,190
realm of determined things it's it's

303
00:12:16,779 --> 00:12:19,779
presents itself as a realm of

304
00:12:18,190 --> 00:12:22,120
possibility and there's good choices in

305
00:12:19,779 --> 00:12:23,950
that realm and there's poor choices or

306
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:27,730
even evil choices in that realm and

307
00:12:23,950 --> 00:12:29,020
we're negotiating continually deciding

308
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:31,980
which of those choices we're going to

309
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:34,060
bring into being that seems to me to be

310
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:36,190
phenomenologically indisputable and we

311
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:37,510
certainly treat each other as if that's

312
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:39,310
what we're doing because we hold each

313
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:41,829
other responsible for our actions you

314
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:44,800
know with some exceptions and that we're

315
00:12:41,829 --> 00:12:49,839
deciding each moment whether to make

316
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:52,630
things better or worse and that seems to

317
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:55,630
me to be correct and I think that that's

318
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:58,120
what these stories illustrate they don't

319
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:59,770
say that directly you know although I

320
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:03,579
think it gets more and more explicit as

321
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:06,420
the narrative unfolds but and then part

322
00:13:03,579 --> 00:13:09,550
of the realism of the stories is that

323
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:12,100
the people aren't the people that are

324
00:13:09,550 --> 00:13:14,320
being presented are by no means good I

325
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,490
mean maybe with the exception of Noah no

326
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,620
one seemed to be a pretty good guile

327
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:21,070
they did he did get drunk and you know

328
00:13:17,620 --> 00:13:25,450
and and end up naked exposed to his sons

329
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:27,250
and so forth and but I mean he isn't

330
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:28,930
talked about a lot as a character it's a

331
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:31,000
pretty compressed story but Abraham I

332
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:32,920
mean Abraham had plenty of problems not

333
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:35,110
least of which was in his inability to

334
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:36,850
leave home and then you know his lying

335
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:38,770
about his wife and their there's all

336
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:41,920
sorts of mistakes and then Jacob who

337
00:13:38,770 --> 00:13:45,370
were going to talk about tonight is an

338
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:47,470
even more morally ambivalent character

339
00:13:45,370 --> 00:13:50,070
he's especially at the beginning of the

340
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:50,070
story he's

341
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:57,070
it's it's he isn't the sort of person

342
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:59,110
that you would pick out especially if

343
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:01,900
you were a hack writer you wouldn't pick

344
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:03,220
him out as the hero of the story he does

345
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:04,120
a lot of things that are really pretty

346
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,830
reprehensible

347
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:08,410
and takes him an awful long time to

348
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:10,900
learn better and yet he's the person

349
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:12,850
who's put forward as the father of the

350
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:16,680
12 tribes of Israel it's from this

351
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:19,720
flawed person that the people that that

352
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:23,170
may be that whose story you might say is

353
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:25,000
that the fundamental constitutes the

354
00:14:23,170 --> 00:14:26,890
fundamental underpinning of our culture

355
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:31,000
it's it's from this deeply flawed

356
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:32,470
individual that that group emerges and

357
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:35,650
so you might think of that as a relief

358
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:37,870
to because you know you're no knight in

359
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:40,570
shining armor you know with with a with

360
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:43,240
a pure moral past I mean people make

361
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:47,020
mistakes of catastrophic proportions

362
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:48,940
non-stop you know and that also means

363
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:51,580
that these stories put forward something

364
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:54,580
approximating hope because in their

365
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:57,910
realism in their moral realism they

366
00:14:54,580 --> 00:15:00,250
present heroes I suppose the heroes of

367
00:14:57,910 --> 00:15:04,630
renown right the patriarchs of old let's

368
00:15:00,250 --> 00:15:06,760
say who are realistic people who have

369
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:09,060
fits of anger and rage and who are

370
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:13,750
murderous at times and who are deeply

371
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:16,720
deeply embroiled with family dispute and

372
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:19,030
and who who have adulterous affairs and

373
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:22,000
and like they do all the terrible things

374
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:26,920
that people do and the weird thing is is

375
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:29,920
that God is still with them and you know

376
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:33,610
it isn't obvious what that means or even

377
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:35,500
if it means anything but it's very it's

378
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:39,520
not disputable as far as I can tell that

379
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:41,590
a were conscious and that consciousness

380
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:43,840
is a transcendent phenomena which which

381
00:15:41,590 --> 00:15:45,460
we do not understand and that the

382
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:47,980
landscape that we traverse through is

383
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:49,840
moral like every story you ever watch

384
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:51,640
anything that grips your imagination on

385
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:54,370
the screen or in the theater like any

386
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:56,140
story that grabs you is a story of moral

387
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:58,660
striving it's just not interesting

388
00:15:56,140 --> 00:16:00,550
otherwise right the person has to be

389
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:02,440
confronted with complex moral choices

390
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:03,850
and then you see the outcome and you

391
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,620
know the good guy doesn't

392
00:16:03,850 --> 00:16:07,060
and the bad guy does it badly and things

393
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:08,950
don't go so well for the bad guy

394
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:10,570
generally and if it's a bit more

395
00:16:08,950 --> 00:16:12,880
sophisticated than good and the bad are

396
00:16:10,570 --> 00:16:17,820
in the same individual and that's you

397
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:17,820
know that's a more compelling story but

398
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:24,640
so we could say well let's we could make

399
00:16:23,410 --> 00:16:27,160
the assumption that it might be

400
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:29,410
worthwhile thinking of the world as a as

401
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:31,960
it has been thought of classically as a

402
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:35,320
theater upon which the forces of good

403
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:38,800
and evil continually strive for

404
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:40,450
dominance and I for the life of me

405
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,640
especially after I started reading

406
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:44,290
deeply into 20th century history and all

407
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:46,020
the terrible things that happened in the

408
00:16:44,290 --> 00:16:49,000
20th century and all the terrible

409
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:50,500
unbelievably incomprehensible things

410
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,980
that people did to one another

411
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:57,340
I just couldn't see seeing things any

412
00:16:53,980 --> 00:17:00,100
other way is realistic you know because

413
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:01,870
I don't think that you can immerse

414
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:03,370
yourself in 20th century history without

415
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:07,870
coming to the conclusion that evil is a

416
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:09,339
reality and if it's a reality that it

417
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:11,310
depends on what you mean by reality but

418
00:17:09,339 --> 00:17:13,810
it's fundamental enough reality for me

419
00:17:11,310 --> 00:17:15,490
and if it's a reality then I don't see

420
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:18,760
how you can escape from the conclusion

421
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:23,370
that the cosmos as we experience it at

422
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:25,270
least is a place of moral striving and

423
00:17:23,370 --> 00:17:27,010
well that's one of the things that's

424
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:32,280
really illustrated in the story of Jacob

425
00:17:27,010 --> 00:17:32,280
and and I found that quite striking so

426
00:17:35,770 --> 00:17:42,680
so the last time last lecture I ended

427
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:44,870
with the Abrahamic stories with the

428
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:47,330
death of Sarah and that was Abraham's

429
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:50,390
wife and so we're gonna continue from

430
00:17:47,330 --> 00:17:53,120
from there remember Abraham had a son

431
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:55,580
Isaac and he was asked by God to

432
00:17:53,120 --> 00:18:00,560
sacrifice his son which we talked about

433
00:17:55,580 --> 00:18:02,510
in in some depth and I was attempting to

434
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:05,060
make the case that you know the idea of

435
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:07,820
sacrifice was one of humankind's great

436
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:09,950
discoveries because it meant the

437
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:11,450
discovery of the future essentially but

438
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:13,310
it also meant the discovery that the

439
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:15,080
future was something that you could make

440
00:18:13,310 --> 00:18:16,880
a bargain with and that you could give

441
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:19,460
up something now something impulsive

442
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:22,540
some pleasure even a deep pleasure in

443
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:24,560
the moment and you could strive and

444
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:26,720
hypothetically you could make a covenant

445
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:29,120
a bargain with the future and if your

446
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:30,710
sacrifices were acceptable and that

447
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:32,960
seemed to mean an ethically acceptable

448
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:34,730
you had to sacrifice the right thing

449
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,860
that that vastly increased the

450
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:39,380
probability that not only you would be

451
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:42,290
successful let's say but that your

452
00:18:39,380 --> 00:18:43,970
descendants would be too and I don't

453
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:46,550
think that that's an irrational

454
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:48,020
proposition I mean you have to leave in

455
00:18:46,550 --> 00:18:50,450
it a bit with the realization that

456
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:52,550
sometimes you know you get sliced off at

457
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:54,740
the knees no matter what right because

458
00:18:52,550 --> 00:18:58,910
life has an arbitrary element and and

459
00:18:54,740 --> 00:19:01,220
that can't be tossed out but building in

460
00:18:58,910 --> 00:19:02,990
the arbitrary element will say you still

461
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:05,210
want to think well what's your best bet

462
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:08,650
given a certain amount of randomness and

463
00:19:05,210 --> 00:19:11,810
it seems to me that conscious self-aware

464
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:14,120
sacrifice and proper ethical striving is

465
00:19:11,810 --> 00:19:16,760
your best bet and you know there's

466
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:19,280
another idea that well I've always

467
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:21,020
explained it when I've explained it to

468
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,490
people I've always used the movie

469
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:24,890
Pinocchio as an example you know that

470
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:28,810
when Geppetto was trying to make his

471
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:32,750
puppet into a self-aware and autonomous

472
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:35,390
moral agent which is what he wants above

473
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:37,730
all else you know he aims at the highest

474
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:39,530
good that he can conceive which is the

475
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:42,200
star that he prays to essentially and

476
00:19:39,530 --> 00:19:43,250
hopes for the transformation and there's

477
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:46,250
also something in that that's

478
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:48,860
unutterably profound and maybe that is

479
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:49,490
somewhat independent of the idea that

480
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:51,620
you

481
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:53,750
have to believe in God I would also say

482
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:55,370
that what it means to believe in God in

483
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:57,590
the old testament is by no means clear

484
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:59,390
and that's something I also really want

485
00:19:57,590 --> 00:20:04,250
to talk about tonight it's not obvious

486
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:07,730
what it means and well Gepetto what he

487
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:09,620
does at least is aim at the highest good

488
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:11,200
of which he can conceive you know and

489
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:14,030
that that's actually in a philosophical

490
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:15,320
definition of God upon occasion that God

491
00:20:14,030 --> 00:20:19,700
is the highest good of which you

492
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:22,429
conceive and you know that's different

493
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:25,370
than the idea of a transcendent being

494
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:26,630
precisely but it's in line with it's in

495
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:28,580
line with certain interesting

496
00:20:26,630 --> 00:20:30,020
psychoanalytic speculations this is one

497
00:20:28,580 --> 00:20:30,800
of the things I really liked about Carl

498
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:33,110
Jung you know

499
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:34,700
Jung was so radical a thinker it's just

500
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:36,740
beyond belief like I've read a lot of

501
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:37,760
critics of you and I've always I've

502
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:39,710
always got too kicked out of them

503
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:41,780
because the things they accused Jung of

504
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:43,760
are so trivial compared to the things

505
00:20:41,780 --> 00:20:47,330
that Jung actually did that it's like

506
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:49,910
accusing a murderer of jaywalking like

507
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:51,920
because Jung was unbelievably radical

508
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:54,140
like here's one of his ideas you know he

509
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:56,270
thought that it was necessary he

510
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:58,460
believed that psychotherapy could be

511
00:20:56,270 --> 00:21:00,380
replaced by a supreme moral effort and

512
00:20:58,460 --> 00:21:02,480
so the moral effort would be something

513
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:04,250
like aiming after good and then trying

514
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:08,690
to integrate yourself around that and

515
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:10,730
that the the good at which you aimed

516
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:13,460
would be something approximating what

517
00:21:10,730 --> 00:21:15,470
you would be like if you manifested your

518
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:18,050
full potential and that you have a

519
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:19,250
glimmering of what that full potential

520
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:21,559
was so that would be the potential

521
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:23,540
future you and he thought of that he

522
00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:25,160
thought of people as four dimensional

523
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:28,070
entities especially essentially that

524
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:30,440
were stretched across time and that you

525
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:32,990
as a totality across time including your

526
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:35,540
potential manifested yourself also in

527
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:37,940
the here and now and that part of what

528
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:39,559
your potential manifested itself was

529
00:21:37,940 --> 00:21:41,600
something like the voice of conscious

530
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:43,820
conscience or intuition

531
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:45,590
it's amazing idea it's an amazing idea

532
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:47,390
right because it's like what you could

533
00:21:45,590 --> 00:21:49,580
be in the future beckons to you in the

534
00:21:47,390 --> 00:21:50,900
present and helps you determine the

535
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:53,630
difference between good and evil

536
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:56,330
it's a mind-boggling idea and you know I

537
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:59,000
think that it's an idea you have to

538
00:21:56,330 --> 00:22:01,919
contend with and then he went further

539
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:04,690
than that and this is this is also

540
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,890
remarkable idea you know he was

541
00:22:04,690 --> 00:22:08,350
interested in this symbolic

542
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:10,000
representation of Christ and I mean

543
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:13,030
psychologically speaking and he thought

544
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:16,480
of Christ as the representation of the

545
00:22:13,030 --> 00:22:19,690
ideal potential human it's something

546
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:21,250
like that so it was a symbolic rip thats

547
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:23,290
what Christ was is a symbolic

548
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:25,240
representation of the ideal potential of

549
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:27,580
a human being and so for young there was

550
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:29,980
no difference between there was no

551
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:32,290
psychological difference between who you

552
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:34,290
could be in the future beckoning to you

553
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:36,400
and the prey in the present and

554
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:37,080
orienting yourself in relationship to

555
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,980
Christ

556
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:42,429
psychologically those were the same

557
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:44,559
thing and then so that's a pretty

558
00:22:42,429 --> 00:22:47,049
mind-boggling idea like seriously that's

559
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:49,510
a mind-boggling idea you know especially

560
00:22:47,049 --> 00:22:51,790
when you add the psychological idea that

561
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:53,950
the one of the things that characterizes

562
00:22:51,790 --> 00:22:56,230
your ideal future self is the ability to

563
00:22:53,950 --> 00:22:58,210
make sacrifices right and the deeper the

564
00:22:56,230 --> 00:23:00,400
sacrifice the better and then also to

565
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:02,440
recover from the sacrifice right so

566
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:04,660
that's the death and rebirth so the part

567
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:08,320
of you that's most essential to your

568
00:23:04,660 --> 00:23:11,290
full flowering as a as a being is your

569
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:13,419
ability to let things go and then spring

570
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:15,580
back from that so to die in some sense

571
00:23:13,419 --> 00:23:18,520
and to be reborn in the service of a

572
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:21,370
higher good and then well then the next

573
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:24,340
part of that is that the direction of

574
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:26,049
the world depends on you doing that so

575
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:28,179
not only your own life but your family's

576
00:23:26,049 --> 00:23:30,460
life and and because we're networked so

577
00:23:28,179 --> 00:23:33,040
intently together you know that the

578
00:23:30,460 --> 00:23:35,650
whole panoply of humankind that may be

579
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:38,049
the structure of the of the cosmos and

580
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:40,450
you know you might think well no but you

581
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:44,140
know it's not so simple it's not so

582
00:23:40,450 --> 00:23:46,059
simple first of all one person can wreak

583
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:47,950
an awful lot of havoc there's absolutely

584
00:23:46,059 --> 00:23:49,600
no doubt about that and as we get more

585
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:52,570
technologically powerful that becomes

586
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:54,190
even more relevant and important and and

587
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:55,900
and crucial you know one of the things

588
00:23:54,190 --> 00:23:58,450
that Young said was that we had to wake

589
00:23:55,900 --> 00:24:00,760
up because we are too technologically

590
00:23:58,450 --> 00:24:03,100
powerful to be as morally asleep as we

591
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:05,110
are and that seems to me just to be

592
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:08,080
self-evident that's yeah for sure that's

593
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:10,600
true we're we're we're half asleep with

594
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:15,270
nuclear bombs it's not a good idea it's

595
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:15,270
seriously not a good idea and so

596
00:24:16,359 --> 00:24:21,549
well and then you might ask yourself -

597
00:24:18,829 --> 00:24:24,409
you don't well like what is the ultimate

598
00:24:21,549 --> 00:24:27,289
potential of a fully developed human

599
00:24:24,409 --> 00:24:29,629
being and well we certainly know that

600
00:24:27,289 --> 00:24:30,859
you have admiration for people who are

601
00:24:29,629 --> 00:24:33,129
more developed rather than less

602
00:24:30,859 --> 00:24:35,839
developed that's that just happens

603
00:24:33,129 --> 00:24:37,219
automatic or resentment that but that's

604
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:39,109
okay it's the same thing it doesn't

605
00:24:37,219 --> 00:24:41,239
matter but it's not like you can't

606
00:24:39,109 --> 00:24:42,859
identify them you can identify them you

607
00:24:41,239 --> 00:24:45,049
know and and they're put forward to you

608
00:24:42,859 --> 00:24:47,389
in in in drama and fiction and all of

609
00:24:45,049 --> 00:24:49,219
that constantly so that's another form

610
00:24:47,389 --> 00:24:50,929
of moral intuition you know you can

611
00:24:49,219 --> 00:25:01,129
write you can discern the wheat from the

612
00:24:50,929 --> 00:25:03,469
chaff let's say and and so the other

613
00:25:01,129 --> 00:25:06,309
thing that I was thinking about that's

614
00:25:03,469 --> 00:25:09,019
worth consideration too is that you know

615
00:25:06,309 --> 00:25:13,159
and maybe this is maybe this is petty

616
00:25:09,019 --> 00:25:14,239
but I don't think it is somebody asked

617
00:25:13,159 --> 00:25:17,089
me the other day if I believed in

618
00:25:14,239 --> 00:25:20,839
miracles and I hate being asked

619
00:25:17,089 --> 00:25:22,489
questions like that you know and you

620
00:25:20,839 --> 00:25:24,439
know it's also people ask me do I

621
00:25:22,489 --> 00:25:26,059
believe in God and like I don't know

622
00:25:24,439 --> 00:25:27,379
what they mean when they say that and so

623
00:25:26,059 --> 00:25:28,729
I don't know what the answer because I

624
00:25:27,379 --> 00:25:30,169
don't think we're talking necessarily

625
00:25:28,729 --> 00:25:32,539
going to talk about the same thing but

626
00:25:30,169 --> 00:25:34,129
in any case I said yes and I have a

627
00:25:32,539 --> 00:25:39,409
variety of reasons for that but one of

628
00:25:34,129 --> 00:25:43,069
them is that you know the consensus

629
00:25:39,409 --> 00:25:45,169
among physicists is that we can track

630
00:25:43,069 --> 00:25:47,539
the origin of the cosmos to something

631
00:25:45,169 --> 00:25:49,579
like a hundred millionth of a millionth

632
00:25:47,539 --> 00:25:53,599
of a second after the Big Bang it's like

633
00:25:49,579 --> 00:25:55,729
it's so close to the Big Bang that the

634
00:25:53,599 --> 00:25:58,699
difference is literally infinitesimal

635
00:25:55,729 --> 00:26:00,859
but the consensus is that before that

636
00:25:58,699 --> 00:26:05,869
whatever that is the laws of physics

637
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:08,839
themselves break down well what what do

638
00:26:05,869 --> 00:26:11,419
you call an event that exists outside

639
00:26:08,839 --> 00:26:13,039
the laws of physics that by definition

640
00:26:11,419 --> 00:26:14,739
that's a miracle now that doesn't

641
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:16,279
necessarily mean that there's a

642
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:18,589
transcendent Adi

643
00:26:16,279 --> 00:26:22,789
that caused the event that's a separate

644
00:26:18,589 --> 00:26:26,269
issue but it does imply a barrier of

645
00:26:22,789 --> 00:26:27,920
some sort beyond which we can't go where

646
00:26:26,269 --> 00:26:31,840
some other set of rules apply

647
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:45,549
and so I find that interesting as well

648
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:50,270
so all right so Sarah dies and Abraham

649
00:26:45,549 --> 00:26:52,549
makes a bargain with the Hittites to

650
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:54,679
purchase a burial place for her and they

651
00:26:52,549 --> 00:26:56,540
offer it as a gift and he insists upon

652
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:58,670
paying for it it's a little story that

653
00:26:56,540 --> 00:27:01,090
basically indicates two things that

654
00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:03,770
Abraham was the kind of guy that you

655
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:06,049
trust pretty much when you see him and

656
00:27:03,770 --> 00:27:07,870
that even if something is offered to him

657
00:27:06,049 --> 00:27:11,900
as a gift he's going to do everything to

658
00:27:07,870 --> 00:27:14,299
be reciprocal about it and and so it's

659
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:16,040
not a massively important part of the

660
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:20,780
story but it's it's in keeping with the

661
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:22,669
same narrative flow and so Efron who's a

662
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:24,590
hit I'd offer Zabar you'll place as a

663
00:27:22,669 --> 00:27:26,750
gift and Abraham says no you know you

664
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:29,120
have to let me pay for it and Efrain

665
00:27:26,750 --> 00:27:31,790
says he will and that works out very

666
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:36,919
well and so he has a good burial place

667
00:27:31,790 --> 00:27:41,360
for his wife and then Abraham decides

668
00:27:36,919 --> 00:27:47,630
that Isaac needs a wife and so he sends

669
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:50,780
his eldest servant to Mesopotamia to

670
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:53,330
find a wife for Isaac and there's a

671
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:55,460
strange ritual that's performed so it

672
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:58,809
says in the story that the servant

673
00:27:55,460 --> 00:28:01,700
places his hand under Abraham's thigh to

674
00:27:58,809 --> 00:28:04,549
to swear but that isn't really what it

675
00:28:01,700 --> 00:28:06,590
means it means that he places his hand I

676
00:28:04,549 --> 00:28:09,470
don't know exactly how to say this

677
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:13,010
properly well use your imagination how

678
00:28:09,470 --> 00:28:15,650
about that and the idea is that as far

679
00:28:13,010 --> 00:28:17,660
as I can tell that he's swearing on the

680
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:19,190
future he's swearing on future people

681
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:20,540
it's something like that so that's

682
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:23,030
that's sort of what testified means

683
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:26,210
right think about the route well I'm not

684
00:28:23,030 --> 00:28:28,190
kidding I'm not kidding that is what it

685
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:32,360
that's that is the derivation right it

686
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:34,880
is the derivation so so so anyways this

687
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:36,770
is a serious issue and so that servant

688
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:40,710
has to go and find Isaac a good wife and

689
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:43,200
he wants him to find Isaac wife who

690
00:28:40,710 --> 00:28:44,880
is willing to accept the same

691
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:47,309
fundamental belief system which is

692
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,929
something like the belief in a god

693
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:51,029
that's a unity rather than a plurality

694
00:28:48,929 --> 00:28:54,840
you know the other thing that Jung was

695
00:28:51,029 --> 00:28:59,330
very insistent upon was that there was a

696
00:28:54,840 --> 00:29:02,399
relationship between polytheism and

697
00:28:59,330 --> 00:29:04,919
psychological confusion and monotheism

698
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:07,309
and psychological unification I really

699
00:29:04,919 --> 00:29:09,480
like that idea too that you know that

700
00:29:07,309 --> 00:29:11,220
what you're trying to do because you are

701
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:12,600
a plurality that that's one of the

702
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,919
things the psychoanalysts we're really

703
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:16,590
good at figuring out that the cognitive

704
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:18,059
scientists haven't touched yet as far as

705
00:29:16,590 --> 00:29:19,380
I could tell they're way behind the

706
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:21,559
psychoanalysts in that element of

707
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:24,049
thinking is that you are composed of sub

708
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:26,250
personalities which all have their own

709
00:29:24,049 --> 00:29:27,960
desires and their own viewpoint their

710
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:30,659
own thoughts and their own perceptions

711
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:31,770
and they're in a war with each other

712
00:29:30,659 --> 00:29:34,289
constantly

713
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:37,169
maybe even a Darwinian war it's been

714
00:29:34,289 --> 00:29:40,289
it's been portrayed that way by certain

715
00:29:37,169 --> 00:29:43,529
neuroscientists and that that one of the

716
00:29:40,289 --> 00:29:45,990
goals of life is to integrate all of

717
00:29:43,529 --> 00:29:47,779
that plurality into a hierarchical

718
00:29:45,990 --> 00:29:51,659
ethical structure that has some

719
00:29:47,779 --> 00:29:53,340
canonical ethic at the pinnacle right

720
00:29:51,659 --> 00:29:55,950
we've talked a little bit about that and

721
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:58,110
it's not obvious what should be at the

722
00:29:55,950 --> 00:30:00,690
pinnacle but we can guess at it it's

723
00:29:58,110 --> 00:30:02,820
it's that which we admire that's one way

724
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:05,580
of thinking about it it's that that

725
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:07,140
describes fair play across a sequence of

726
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:09,240
games that's another good way of

727
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:11,220
thinking about it it's it's the heroic

728
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:12,990
ideal that's another way of thinking

729
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:15,120
about it but it's it's combined with

730
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:16,620
generosity you know because the hero the

731
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,570
mythological hero goes out into the

732
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:21,240
unknown and slays the dragon and gets

733
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:22,890
the gold but then comes back to the

734
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:26,330
community and distributes what's found

735
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:29,990
and so it's courage plus generosity and

736
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:31,890
and so all of your all of that interior

737
00:30:29,990 --> 00:30:35,429
struggling that you're doing is an

738
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:38,490
attempt to bang yourself against the

739
00:30:35,429 --> 00:30:40,169
world with challenge constantly to hit

740
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:43,409
everything together like you're beating

741
00:30:40,169 --> 00:30:46,710
on a piece of iron to to to cure it

742
00:30:43,409 --> 00:30:48,299
let's say so that you don't you're not

743
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:50,940
an internal contradiction you're not

744
00:30:48,299 --> 00:30:52,820
massive competing gods something like

745
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:54,570
that because it's just too

746
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:56,850
psychologically stressful and

747
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:58,259
hard on everyone else and impossible for

748
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:59,730
them to get along with you if you're one

749
00:30:58,259 --> 00:31:04,500
thing one moment and another thing

750
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:06,840
another moment and so so anyways Abraham

751
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:09,720
insists that Isaac find a wife from

752
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:11,970
among people who are likely to carry off

753
00:31:09,720 --> 00:31:13,440
forward the monotheistic tradition and

754
00:31:11,970 --> 00:31:14,909
I'm not sure that the monotheistic

755
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:17,789
tradition is actually indistinguishable

756
00:31:14,909 --> 00:31:19,769
is actually distinguishable from the

757
00:31:17,789 --> 00:31:21,899
individualistic tradition I think they

758
00:31:19,769 --> 00:31:25,019
might be the same thing at different

759
00:31:21,899 --> 00:31:28,710
levels of analysis you know so because

760
00:31:25,019 --> 00:31:30,360
individual means undivided in some sense

761
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:33,480
right to be an individual means to be

762
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:35,820
one thing and the other thing that

763
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:37,590
mitigates against the idea of life as

764
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:40,350
happiness is it isn't obvious to me that

765
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:42,179
it's happiness that is what molds you

766
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:44,580
and shapes you you know it's something

767
00:31:42,179 --> 00:31:46,200
more like optimal challenge voluntarily

768
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:47,940
undertaken it's something like that

769
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,559
right and I think that's echoed in the

770
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:51,750
idea that everyone has a moral

771
00:31:49,559 --> 00:31:54,029
obligation to raise their cross

772
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:57,960
something like that to accept the fact

773
00:31:54,029 --> 00:31:59,639
of their mortality voluntarily I believe

774
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:01,259
that that's the case and I do actually

775
00:31:59,639 --> 00:32:03,269
think that that's a prerequisite to

776
00:32:01,259 --> 00:32:06,029
proper psychological development because

777
00:32:03,269 --> 00:32:08,789
if you're not willing to take your

778
00:32:06,029 --> 00:32:10,320
mortality on voluntarily like if you're

779
00:32:08,789 --> 00:32:12,389
kicking and fighting about it constantly

780
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:15,629
and you have every reason to don't get

781
00:32:12,389 --> 00:32:17,340
me wrong then you can't act forthrightly

782
00:32:15,629 --> 00:32:19,620
in the world right you're going to be

783
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:22,320
afraid and when you're afraid then you

784
00:32:19,620 --> 00:32:24,000
can't voluntarily take on a challenge

785
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,379
and then if you can't take voluntarily

786
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:27,960
take on a challenge then you can't

787
00:32:25,379 --> 00:32:30,779
develop and so again the life seems to

788
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:33,509
be something like if it's a proper life

789
00:32:30,779 --> 00:32:36,269
is the voluntarily voluntary taking on

790
00:32:33,509 --> 00:32:38,039
of great challenges and maybe that's

791
00:32:36,269 --> 00:32:40,259
better than happiness like it's

792
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:42,419
certainly more noble you know it's not a

793
00:32:40,259 --> 00:32:44,190
word we use very much anymore the idea

794
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:46,710
of nobility because we're so obsessed

795
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:49,019
with happiness but I think happiness is

796
00:32:46,710 --> 00:32:52,980
a like if it comes along man great you

797
00:32:49,019 --> 00:32:54,690
know wonderful don't don't take it

798
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:57,000
lightly or for granted because it's

799
00:32:54,690 --> 00:33:00,330
fleeting but the idea that that's what

800
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,940
you should be for in some sense - seems

801
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:04,320
to me if that's what life is for then

802
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:06,950
maybe it shouldn't be maybe that's

803
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:08,220
correct because that isn't what life is

804
00:33:06,950 --> 00:33:09,570
but

805
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:11,880
so doesn't it isn't obvious to me that

806
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:14,159
that's what life should be you know I

807
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:17,010
mean if you really loved someone like

808
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:19,049
like your son let's say what do you say

809
00:33:17,010 --> 00:33:21,480
well I hope he has a happy life or would

810
00:33:19,049 --> 00:33:24,470
you say I hope he accomplishes great

811
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:27,830
things it seems to me that that's better

812
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:30,630
the accomplishing of great things and

813
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:32,130
because that's admirable you know it's

814
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:34,470
like a happy person is a happy person

815
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:37,919
but a noble person is an admirable

816
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:39,750
person and and that's that's better man

817
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:42,059
and so maybe there are better things

818
00:33:39,750 --> 00:33:45,000
than happiness and so you can't judge

819
00:33:42,059 --> 00:33:46,860
being on the basis of the ratio of

820
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,140
suffering to pleasure something like

821
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:51,000
that it's and I don't think we do that I

822
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:52,980
don't believe we do that I mean

823
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:54,450
comedians are happy right but everyone

824
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:56,220
doesn't aspire to be a comedian and you

825
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:58,260
don't watch comedy all the time even

826
00:33:56,220 --> 00:34:00,390
though you could laugh non-stop more or

827
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:02,400
less if the comedian's funny you want to

828
00:34:00,390 --> 00:34:04,710
get your teeth into something it also

829
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:05,789
seems to me that this is one of the

830
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:08,909
reasons I like the existential

831
00:34:05,789 --> 00:34:10,800
philosophy was that you know the

832
00:34:08,909 --> 00:34:12,480
existentialist believed it's sort of an

833
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,800
original sin idea they believed that we

834
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,409
came into the world with an ethical

835
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:17,700
burden already laden upon us something

836
00:34:16,409 --> 00:34:19,830
like something like that and that we had

837
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:22,500
a felt sense that it was necessary for

838
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:24,330
us to justify our being and if we didn't

839
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:26,040
do that then we weren't authentic to

840
00:34:24,330 --> 00:34:27,000
ourselves we weren't moving towards

841
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:29,099
individuality

842
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:30,839
we weren't sustaining the community we

843
00:34:29,099 --> 00:34:33,359
weren't living properly and that and

844
00:34:30,839 --> 00:34:35,490
that that idea was deeply embedded in

845
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:37,919
people as part of their ordinary

846
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:40,800
experience and that also seems to me to

847
00:34:37,919 --> 00:34:42,179
be accurate and you know I've dealt with

848
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:46,050
lots of people say in my clinical

849
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:47,669
practice and they don't really cut they

850
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:50,460
are they will come and say I wish I

851
00:34:47,669 --> 00:34:53,250
wasn't so unhappy but they don't usually

852
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:54,780
come and say I wish I was happier and

853
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:57,570
those things aren't the same and and

854
00:34:54,780 --> 00:34:59,070
then when we when you talk to people who

855
00:34:57,570 --> 00:35:01,320
are having trouble you know they want to

856
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:02,910
straighten things out and figure out how

857
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:05,640
to do them right it's something like

858
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:09,320
that and and that that's the primary

859
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:09,320
that's their primary goal and

860
00:35:16,950 --> 00:35:23,590
so anyways Abraham sends his eldest

861
00:35:21,250 --> 00:35:26,050
servant off to his the place that God

862
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:29,380
has granted him to find a wife and

863
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:31,570
interestingly the borders of the

864
00:35:29,380 --> 00:35:34,780
promised land are quite similar to the

865
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:36,550
current borders of Israel in these are

866
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:38,800
estimates right based on on the biblical

867
00:35:36,550 --> 00:35:41,490
and I mean that's not a fluke obviously

868
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:44,230
but it's it's interesting to see the

869
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:47,560
concordance between these ancient

870
00:35:44,230 --> 00:35:49,660
stories and the present-day world so I

871
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:52,180
thought that was very interesting and it

872
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:54,250
shows once again that the past you think

873
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:56,710
the past is the past but it's not it's

874
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:58,359
it's still here it's embedded in the

875
00:35:56,710 --> 00:36:00,520
present you know just like the future

876
00:35:58,359 --> 00:36:02,980
and somehow in some ways is folded up

877
00:36:00,520 --> 00:36:04,990
inside the present waiting to unfold the

878
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:21,730
past is all folded up inside the present

879
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:24,130
too so anyways the servant goes to the

880
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:26,500
land that he's been charged to go to and

881
00:36:24,130 --> 00:36:28,720
and he's trying to figure out how in the

882
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:30,100
world am I going to find a good wife for

883
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,990
Isaac I mean I don't know any of these

884
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:33,880
people and so he has this little

885
00:36:31,990 --> 00:36:37,810
dialogue that's presented in the form of

886
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:39,609
a prayer I suppose and he thinks well

887
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:41,590
I'm gonna go to the place where you

888
00:36:39,609 --> 00:36:44,230
water where people get water and water

889
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:46,060
the animals and because that's a place

890
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:48,460
where everyone gathers so that's a good

891
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:50,619
place to find someone and and it's it's

892
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:52,780
not a place of fun and lightness and

893
00:36:50,619 --> 00:36:56,710
relaxation and impulsivity it's a place

894
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:58,780
of life-sustaining work and and he

895
00:36:56,710 --> 00:37:02,740
thinks something like well what would a

896
00:36:58,780 --> 00:37:05,619
decent girl do at a watering place and

897
00:37:02,740 --> 00:37:09,540
he thought well maybe she would offer a

898
00:37:05,619 --> 00:37:12,700
stranger some water and also offer to

899
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:15,550
water the camels because that would be

900
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:18,760
brave to approach the stranger and then

901
00:37:15,550 --> 00:37:20,619
generous and then indicative of the

902
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:23,470
willingness to make an effort and when

903
00:37:20,619 --> 00:37:25,660
you know that a camel I think he took

904
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:26,560
ten camels was quite a few camels

905
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:29,740
anyways

906
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:33,010
just one and that a camel can drink 20

907
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:34,720
gallons of water and Rebecca who was

908
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:36,070
drawing water from the wet turns out to

909
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:38,770
be Rebecca I was drawing water from the

910
00:37:36,070 --> 00:37:40,630
well which is hard right because water

911
00:37:38,770 --> 00:37:43,420
is heavy and you have to lift it up and

912
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:45,280
it's ten camels and so that's like 200

913
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:47,050
gallons of waters so you know she has to

914
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:50,530
put herself out a fair a bit in order to

915
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:55,900
make this stranger happy and so that's

916
00:37:50,530 --> 00:37:57,400
what happens and then the servant has

917
00:37:55,900 --> 00:37:59,890
brought along gifts and that sort of

918
00:37:57,400 --> 00:38:02,020
thing and anyways to make a long story

919
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:05,680
short Rebecca

920
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:11,070
agrees to come back to come back with

921
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:14,110
the servant and huh marry Isaac and so

922
00:38:11,070 --> 00:38:16,420
then she has she gets pregnant and she

923
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:19,000
has twins and this is an interesting

924
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:21,250
thing the twins fight inside her she can

925
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,680
tell that that they're not getting along

926
00:38:21,250 --> 00:38:26,080
and this is an echo right it's an echo

927
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:28,480
of Cain and Abel and there's a

928
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:30,430
mythological motif that the unions have

929
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,080
called the hostile brothers the hostile

930
00:38:30,430 --> 00:38:33,730
brothers and you see them all the time

931
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:35,770
Batman and the Joker are hostile

932
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:38,140
brothers and Thor and Loki or hostile

933
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:41,650
brothers and it's an unbelievably common

934
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:43,450
motif and you know the ultimate hostile

935
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:46,090
brothers are Christ and Satan so that's

936
00:38:43,450 --> 00:38:48,160
the that's the archetypal representation

937
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:49,840
of the hostile brothers right the

938
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:52,840
ultimate good and the ultimate evil and

939
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:55,690
so and so it's an echo of the cain and

940
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:57,970
abel story although it's a little more

941
00:38:55,690 --> 00:39:00,040
complex I would say from a literary

942
00:38:57,970 --> 00:39:02,350
point of view because it isn't obvious

943
00:39:00,040 --> 00:39:04,450
which of these brothers is Cain and

944
00:39:02,350 --> 00:39:08,230
which of them is Abel they have parts of

945
00:39:04,450 --> 00:39:10,030
both in each of them so Esau who turns

946
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:11,530
out to be one of the brothers in Jacob

947
00:39:10,030 --> 00:39:14,470
movie turns out to be the other both

948
00:39:11,530 --> 00:39:18,910
have their admirable qualities and their

949
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:22,390
faults anyways Esau comes is born first

950
00:39:18,910 --> 00:39:25,600
but Jacob has him by the heel and so

951
00:39:22,390 --> 00:39:28,030
there was a fight within the womb to see

952
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:30,730
who would emerge first now that's

953
00:39:28,030 --> 00:39:32,710
relevant because the firstborn had a

954
00:39:30,730 --> 00:39:34,270
special status well has a special status

955
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:36,010
in many communities especially

956
00:39:34,270 --> 00:39:38,650
agricultural communities and there's a

957
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:40,539
reason all these people were more herds

958
00:39:38,650 --> 00:39:42,009
people but if you divide your

959
00:39:40,539 --> 00:39:43,779
property equally among all your children

960
00:39:42,009 --> 00:39:45,759
then in like three generations everybody

961
00:39:43,779 --> 00:39:48,009
has one goat and everybody starves to

962
00:39:45,759 --> 00:39:50,650
death you know or the same thing happens

963
00:39:48,009 --> 00:39:52,479
with lands so one of the ways that that

964
00:39:50,650 --> 00:39:54,099
traditional communities solve that is

965
00:39:52,479 --> 00:39:56,650
they just give them almost everything to

966
00:39:54,099 --> 00:39:58,089
the firstborn and then the everyone else

967
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:59,769
knows well you go out and do whatever

968
00:39:58,089 --> 00:40:01,839
you can and it's kind of arbitrary and

969
00:39:59,769 --> 00:40:03,849
unfair but you know at least it's

970
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:07,299
predictably arbitrary and unfair

971
00:40:03,849 --> 00:40:09,279
instead of doom over for generations you

972
00:40:07,299 --> 00:40:11,890
know so it actually mattered to be the

973
00:40:09,279 --> 00:40:14,529
firstborn and and God generally favors

974
00:40:11,890 --> 00:40:16,059
the firstborn and then you might think

975
00:40:14,529 --> 00:40:19,329
well what is it about being born first

976
00:40:16,059 --> 00:40:22,239
that's so relevant apart from the the

977
00:40:19,329 --> 00:40:23,859
cultural practice of abort generous

978
00:40:22,239 --> 00:40:25,779
inheritance and I would say well the

979
00:40:23,859 --> 00:40:27,219
firstborn is something like the model

980
00:40:25,779 --> 00:40:29,769
for the leader of the family right

981
00:40:27,219 --> 00:40:32,499
because the firstborn child should be if

982
00:40:29,769 --> 00:40:34,029
there's a number of siblings they should

983
00:40:32,499 --> 00:40:35,739
take care of the siblings at least to

984
00:40:34,029 --> 00:40:37,539
some degree but also should be a role

985
00:40:35,739 --> 00:40:39,910
model for them so it's like a natural

986
00:40:37,539 --> 00:40:42,369
position of leadership but there's a

987
00:40:39,910 --> 00:40:43,900
site there's a cycle psychologize ation

988
00:40:42,369 --> 00:40:46,299
of the idea of the firstborn in these

989
00:40:43,900 --> 00:40:48,969
stories because god often passes over

990
00:40:46,299 --> 00:40:52,630
the firstborn in favor of a later born

991
00:40:48,969 --> 00:40:54,729
child he seems to do that on the basis

992
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:56,679
of moral character essentially and so

993
00:40:54,729 --> 00:40:59,919
there's this idea that well there's a

994
00:40:56,679 --> 00:41:01,929
natural proclivity towards leadership

995
00:40:59,919 --> 00:41:04,239
that's just a biological fact that would

996
00:41:01,929 --> 00:41:05,909
be associated with being a firstborn but

997
00:41:04,239 --> 00:41:08,319
there's a element of characterological

998
00:41:05,909 --> 00:41:10,239
development that transcends that and so

999
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:12,400
that you it's more important to be

1000
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:14,739
spiritually a firstborn let's say than

1001
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:17,319
to be biologically a firstborn and God

1002
00:41:14,739 --> 00:41:19,599
recognizes that continually in these

1003
00:41:17,319 --> 00:41:22,989
stories and inverts the natural order

1004
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:24,339
and favors a later born who's who's done

1005
00:41:22,989 --> 00:41:26,319
more work with regards to

1006
00:41:24,339 --> 00:41:28,569
characterological development and that's

1007
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:29,890
also interesting to you know I've talked

1008
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:31,989
to lots of business people about

1009
00:41:29,890 --> 00:41:33,669
leadership and there's a literature on

1010
00:41:31,989 --> 00:41:35,400
leadership but it's not a good

1011
00:41:33,669 --> 00:41:37,209
literature it's it's pretty shallow

1012
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:39,009
partly because it's not that easy to

1013
00:41:37,209 --> 00:41:42,130
define leadership and partly because

1014
00:41:39,009 --> 00:41:43,269
there are different you know you people

1015
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:45,189
have different temperaments

1016
00:41:43,269 --> 00:41:46,659
and different temperaments can be

1017
00:41:45,189 --> 00:41:47,079
leaders they just do it in different

1018
00:41:46,659 --> 00:41:48,999
ways

1019
00:41:47,079 --> 00:41:50,619
now there's something in common about

1020
00:41:48,999 --> 00:41:52,479
being a leader though and I would say

1021
00:41:50,619 --> 00:41:54,160
one is that if you're an actual leader

1022
00:41:52,479 --> 00:41:56,349
you actually know where you're going

1023
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:57,970
right because what are you gonna do lead

1024
00:41:56,349 --> 00:41:58,930
people in circles it's like maybe

1025
00:41:57,970 --> 00:42:00,730
they'll follow you but you're not a

1026
00:41:58,930 --> 00:42:02,470
leader you're just a charlatan so you

1027
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:03,579
have to know where you're going and then

1028
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:06,519
you have to be able to communicate that

1029
00:42:03,579 --> 00:42:07,869
and then people have to trust you so you

1030
00:42:06,519 --> 00:42:09,430
actually have to be honest because

1031
00:42:07,869 --> 00:42:12,700
people are at that stupid at least not

1032
00:42:09,430 --> 00:42:14,170
for a long period of time and then where

1033
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:16,119
you're going has to have some value

1034
00:42:14,170 --> 00:42:19,029
because otherwise why would anyone want

1035
00:42:16,119 --> 00:42:20,319
to go along with you so and then you

1036
00:42:19,029 --> 00:42:22,000
might say well what what are the

1037
00:42:20,319 --> 00:42:22,900
attributes then that make you a leader

1038
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:25,660
and I would say well they're

1039
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:30,309
characterological fundamentally and this

1040
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:31,990
is not naive optimism or or or casual

1041
00:42:30,309 --> 00:42:35,130
moralizing it has nothing to do with

1042
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:37,509
that you know we know for example that

1043
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:39,339
conscientiousness that the personality

1044
00:42:37,509 --> 00:42:42,369
trait is a good predictor of long-term

1045
00:42:39,339 --> 00:42:44,019
success in in most occupations not all

1046
00:42:42,369 --> 00:42:45,490
but most and that one of the things

1047
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:47,289
that's associated with conscientiousness

1048
00:42:45,490 --> 00:42:49,450
is that people keep their word they're

1049
00:42:47,289 --> 00:42:51,099
trustworthy and that's certainly one

1050
00:42:49,450 --> 00:42:53,049
element of a leader especially across

1051
00:42:51,099 --> 00:42:54,759
any reasonable amount of time you have

1052
00:42:53,049 --> 00:42:56,410
to be able to trust the person they can

1053
00:42:54,759 --> 00:42:57,910
even be harsh right it doesn't matter

1054
00:42:56,410 --> 00:43:00,039
because you can see harsh leaders and

1055
00:42:57,910 --> 00:43:02,680
kind leaders but as long as they do what

1056
00:43:00,039 --> 00:43:04,990
they say they will do then then you can

1057
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:08,079
follow them and you know that the future

1058
00:43:04,990 --> 00:43:11,589
payoff is is is secure something like

1059
00:43:08,079 --> 00:43:12,940
that so the idea that character logical

1060
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:15,400
development is more important to

1061
00:43:12,940 --> 00:43:18,400
leadership than primogenitor I think

1062
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:21,250
that's the right word primal Genesis

1063
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:24,190
anyways being a firstborn that's a very

1064
00:43:21,250 --> 00:43:25,750
crucial psychological realization that

1065
00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:28,450
it's character logical development that

1066
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:30,819
makes you favored of God you know and I

1067
00:43:28,450 --> 00:43:32,740
do think we've forgotten this in many

1068
00:43:30,819 --> 00:43:35,019
ways because there isn't a lot of

1069
00:43:32,740 --> 00:43:37,240
emphasis in our education system on

1070
00:43:35,019 --> 00:43:39,160
characterological development and that's

1071
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:41,500
very very surprising to me I think maybe

1072
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:43,269
it's partly because in our fractured

1073
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:44,920
society we can't agree on what

1074
00:43:43,269 --> 00:43:48,519
constitutes a reasonable

1075
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:50,619
characterological goal so we just throw

1076
00:43:48,519 --> 00:43:53,289
up our hands and don't educate our kids

1077
00:43:50,619 --> 00:43:55,539
to any degree at all especially in

1078
00:43:53,289 --> 00:43:57,519
schools about what an admirable person

1079
00:43:55,539 --> 00:43:59,109
is like or even let them know that well

1080
00:43:57,519 --> 00:44:01,150
maybe you should actually try to be one

1081
00:43:59,109 --> 00:44:03,279
you know that that's actually the most

1082
00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:04,800
important possible thing that you could

1083
00:44:03,279 --> 00:44:09,939
learn right

1084
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:12,649
[Applause]

1085
00:44:09,939 --> 00:44:15,049
so and I also think and I think this is

1086
00:44:12,649 --> 00:44:17,539
laid out very thoroughly in the biblical

1087
00:44:15,049 --> 00:44:20,329
stories as well is that if there are

1088
00:44:17,539 --> 00:44:22,399
enough people who are admirable then

1089
00:44:20,329 --> 00:44:25,759
things work and if there aren't and

1090
00:44:22,399 --> 00:44:28,369
things things are terrible

1091
00:44:25,759 --> 00:44:31,369
you get wiped out you remember when

1092
00:44:28,369 --> 00:44:34,519
Abraham is bargaining with God with

1093
00:44:31,369 --> 00:44:36,969
regards to Sodom and Gomorrah he asks

1094
00:44:34,519 --> 00:44:39,919
God to save the city if there's like 40

1095
00:44:36,969 --> 00:44:41,809
admirable people right respectable but

1096
00:44:39,919 --> 00:44:43,459
let's say admirable right I don't want I

1097
00:44:41,809 --> 00:44:45,529
don't want to say good because good is

1098
00:44:43,459 --> 00:44:48,499
being corrupted in some sense by casual

1099
00:44:45,529 --> 00:44:52,130
usage I mean admirable noble people

1100
00:44:48,499 --> 00:44:53,929
right I think Abraham bargains got down

1101
00:44:52,130 --> 00:44:55,909
to like ten if there's ten of them in

1102
00:44:53,929 --> 00:44:57,439
the city the city won't be destroyed and

1103
00:44:55,909 --> 00:44:59,359
that that's not very many in this city

1104
00:44:57,439 --> 00:45:01,279
so there's an interesting idea there

1105
00:44:59,359 --> 00:45:03,409
which is that there there doesn't have

1106
00:45:01,279 --> 00:45:05,839
to be that many people in a group who

1107
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:08,929
have their act together but zero is the

1108
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:11,509
wrong number and if it's zero then then

1109
00:45:08,929 --> 00:45:14,149
we're seriously in trouble

1110
00:45:11,509 --> 00:45:15,679
and I think that goes along with the

1111
00:45:14,149 --> 00:45:17,509
idea of the Pareto principle in

1112
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:19,219
economics too which is that it's a small

1113
00:45:17,509 --> 00:45:21,439
minority of people who do most of the

1114
00:45:19,219 --> 00:45:25,369
productive work in any given domain but

1115
00:45:21,439 --> 00:45:26,869
so so a small number of properly

1116
00:45:25,369 --> 00:45:28,699
behaving people might have enough of an

1117
00:45:26,869 --> 00:45:30,169
impact to keep everything moving and

1118
00:45:28,699 --> 00:45:32,119
that might also that might actually be

1119
00:45:30,169 --> 00:45:34,399
true but it can't fall below some

1120
00:45:32,119 --> 00:45:36,139
crucial level and I do think that we're

1121
00:45:34,399 --> 00:45:38,179
in some danger of allowing it to fall

1122
00:45:36,139 --> 00:45:40,609
below some crucial level because our

1123
00:45:38,179 --> 00:45:43,309
society seems to be at war in some ways

1124
00:45:40,609 --> 00:45:46,999
against the idea of the individual and

1125
00:45:43,309 --> 00:45:50,419
individual character per se and I think

1126
00:45:46,999 --> 00:45:53,059
that's absolutely I think that's

1127
00:45:50,419 --> 00:45:53,929
absolutely catastrophic and that's part

1128
00:45:53,059 --> 00:45:55,429
of the reason that I'm doing these

1129
00:45:53,929 --> 00:45:58,539
biblical lectures you know because I

1130
00:45:55,429 --> 00:46:01,819
think that I've known for a long time

1131
00:45:58,539 --> 00:46:04,309
that the moral presuppositions of a

1132
00:46:01,819 --> 00:46:06,649
culture are instantiated in its stories

1133
00:46:04,309 --> 00:46:08,899
they're not instantiated in its explicit

1134
00:46:06,649 --> 00:46:10,759
philosophy there might be a layer of

1135
00:46:08,899 --> 00:46:12,499
explicit philosophy and of course there

1136
00:46:10,759 --> 00:46:13,819
is in the West and a layer of explicit

1137
00:46:12,499 --> 00:46:16,189
law but underneath that there are

1138
00:46:13,819 --> 00:46:18,769
stories and there isn't anything under

1139
00:46:16,189 --> 00:46:19,160
the stories except maybe behavior you

1140
00:46:18,769 --> 00:46:20,630
know and

1141
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:23,120
that's so implicit it doesn't even

1142
00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:26,000
actually count it's not a cognitive

1143
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:27,290
operation and so this is the story these

1144
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:30,980
are the stories that are underneath our

1145
00:46:27,290 --> 00:46:33,860
culture and so there better be something

1146
00:46:30,980 --> 00:46:36,170
to them that's what we hope and but more

1147
00:46:33,860 --> 00:46:38,030
importantly maybe we shouldn't toss them

1148
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:41,150
away without knowing what they mean

1149
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:42,680
because if we toss them away then we're

1150
00:46:41,150 --> 00:46:45,050
throwing everything that we depend on

1151
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:46,730
away as far as I can tell and we'll we

1152
00:46:45,050 --> 00:46:48,830
will pay for it we'll pay for it

1153
00:46:46,730 --> 00:46:50,330
individually because we'll be weak you

1154
00:46:48,830 --> 00:46:53,180
know because if you're not firm in your

1155
00:46:50,330 --> 00:46:54,800
convictions then someone else who's firm

1156
00:46:53,180 --> 00:46:56,780
in their convictions can you're their

1157
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:58,460
puppet like instantly and then you're

1158
00:46:56,780 --> 00:47:00,680
also the puppet of your own doubts right

1159
00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:02,870
because unless you have convictions

1160
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:04,700
you're gonna generate doubts like mad

1161
00:47:02,870 --> 00:47:06,800
because everyone does and then the

1162
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:09,230
doubts win and and you'll be paralyzed

1163
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:11,420
because there'll be you know 50% of you

1164
00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:13,400
moving forward and 50% of you frozen

1165
00:47:11,420 --> 00:47:20,090
stiff and that'll be enough just to

1166
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:21,890
lodge you in place and so okay so

1167
00:47:20,090 --> 00:47:23,330
there's a psychologize ation of the idea

1168
00:47:21,890 --> 00:47:24,740
of leadership which is very important

1169
00:47:23,330 --> 00:47:26,480
and then it's associated with the idea

1170
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:27,740
of character or logical development and

1171
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:30,770
it's associated with the idea of

1172
00:47:27,740 --> 00:47:32,600
struggle not happiness and it's also

1173
00:47:30,770 --> 00:47:34,580
associated with this Abrahamic idea

1174
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,960
which I really liked and which was

1175
00:47:34,580 --> 00:47:38,090
something that's been very useful to me

1176
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:40,370
as a consequence of doing these lectures

1177
00:47:38,090 --> 00:47:42,230
because remember at the beginning of the

1178
00:47:40,370 --> 00:47:44,060
Abrahamic stories abraham's like a

1179
00:47:42,230 --> 00:47:45,770
stay-at-home guy right he's like the guy

1180
00:47:44,060 --> 00:47:48,050
who's 40 years old living in his in his

1181
00:47:45,770 --> 00:47:49,520
in his mother's basement and god says

1182
00:47:48,050 --> 00:47:51,590
like get the hell out of there you know

1183
00:47:49,520 --> 00:47:54,800
get out in the world where you belong go

1184
00:47:51,590 --> 00:47:56,540
do something difficult because what

1185
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:57,740
you're doing isn't acceptable and you

1186
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:59,330
know the first thing he does is go

1187
00:47:57,740 --> 00:48:00,770
somewhere there's a terrible famine and

1188
00:47:59,330 --> 00:48:03,110
then he goes somewhere there's a tyranny

1189
00:48:00,770 --> 00:48:05,050
so you know it's it's pretty funny he

1190
00:48:03,110 --> 00:48:07,370
follows God's call and it's not like

1191
00:48:05,050 --> 00:48:09,530
sweetness and light and paradise

1192
00:48:07,370 --> 00:48:12,440
immediately it's nothing like that it's

1193
00:48:09,530 --> 00:48:16,870
it's instantaneous combat you know of

1194
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:19,850
the most difficult kind so but but

1195
00:48:16,870 --> 00:48:22,640
Abraham does in fact follow that impulse

1196
00:48:19,850 --> 00:48:24,530
and you know it's interesting too I mean

1197
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:26,450
I don't know here's another thing that

1198
00:48:24,530 --> 00:48:29,450
made me a really an advocate of

1199
00:48:26,450 --> 00:48:31,130
psychoanalytic thinking and it was the

1200
00:48:29,450 --> 00:48:32,960
sort of thing that started to terrify me

1201
00:48:31,130 --> 00:48:34,640
about what the human psyche was out

1202
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:37,359
like I started to understand that not

1203
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:40,220
only were we like an amalgam of

1204
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:42,410
relatively autonomous subpersonalities

1205
00:48:40,220 --> 00:48:46,599
each of which had the possibility of

1206
00:48:42,410 --> 00:48:50,170
gaining control but that we were also

1207
00:48:46,599 --> 00:48:53,020
victim you might say or beneficiary of

1208
00:48:50,170 --> 00:48:56,599
impulses that were beyond our conscious

1209
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:59,900
formulation or or or understanding or

1210
00:48:56,599 --> 00:49:02,720
capacity to resist so here's this here's

1211
00:48:59,900 --> 00:49:04,640
a funny story so I was talking to one of

1212
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:07,640
my patreon people online this week and

1213
00:49:04,640 --> 00:49:09,680
he said he was a committed atheist and

1214
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:10,880
that's fine you know lots of atheists

1215
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:13,180
are very honest people and they're

1216
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:16,089
atheists because they don't know how to

1217
00:49:13,180 --> 00:49:18,080
reconcile what they know with

1218
00:49:16,089 --> 00:49:20,359
traditional claims let's say and they're

1219
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:22,400
not willing to just mangle them together

1220
00:49:20,359 --> 00:49:24,050
you know and there might be cynicism all

1221
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:26,720
that associated with it as well but he

1222
00:49:24,050 --> 00:49:28,820
said he was he said he was entranced by

1223
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:30,560
these biblical lectures you know which

1224
00:49:28,820 --> 00:49:32,030
is pretty weird and he said if someone

1225
00:49:30,560 --> 00:49:34,040
would have told him a year ago that he

1226
00:49:32,030 --> 00:49:35,570
was going to like be obsessed with the

1227
00:49:34,040 --> 00:49:38,359
sequence of biblical lectures he would

1228
00:49:35,570 --> 00:49:39,619
have told them that they were mad and so

1229
00:49:38,359 --> 00:49:41,570
we had a bit of a discussion about that

1230
00:49:39,619 --> 00:49:44,080
and because this is an interesting thing

1231
00:49:41,570 --> 00:49:46,430
you know and he mentioned this he said

1232
00:49:44,080 --> 00:49:48,440
it was something like you don't choose

1233
00:49:46,430 --> 00:49:50,540
your interests they choose you and

1234
00:49:48,440 --> 00:49:52,880
that's really worth thinking about to

1235
00:49:50,540 --> 00:49:54,109
man because you know it's really hard to

1236
00:49:52,880 --> 00:49:55,640
get interested in something you're not

1237
00:49:54,109 --> 00:49:57,170
interested in even if you know there's a

1238
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:58,640
good reason for it you know you're

1239
00:49:57,170 --> 00:50:01,849
studying for an exam you find the

1240
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:03,470
material boring you know anything will

1241
00:50:01,849 --> 00:50:05,180
be more interesting than than the

1242
00:50:03,470 --> 00:50:06,830
studying even though you know that

1243
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:09,230
that's what you need to do you can't

1244
00:50:06,830 --> 00:50:11,330
voluntarily grab yourself by the scruff

1245
00:50:09,230 --> 00:50:13,280
of the neck let's say and shake yourself

1246
00:50:11,330 --> 00:50:15,320
and say sit down and concentrate your

1247
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:17,480
mind will just go everywhere but then if

1248
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:18,710
you're interested in something and even

1249
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:20,180
if it's something you shouldn't be

1250
00:50:18,710 --> 00:50:20,540
interested in because that happens all

1251
00:50:20,180 --> 00:50:22,790
the time

1252
00:50:20,540 --> 00:50:24,740
then it's like you're a laser focus man

1253
00:50:22,790 --> 00:50:26,240
you can pay attention forever you can

1254
00:50:24,740 --> 00:50:27,500
work until you're exhausted you won't

1255
00:50:26,240 --> 00:50:30,260
even notice it then you remember

1256
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:31,760
everything it's like okay if you can't

1257
00:50:30,260 --> 00:50:35,990
control your interest

1258
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:37,609
what does and man I tell you you can

1259
00:50:35,990 --> 00:50:40,310
think about that for a very long time so

1260
00:50:37,609 --> 00:50:42,440
Jung talked about the spirit mercurius

1261
00:50:40,310 --> 00:50:44,210
you know Mercury's the winged messenger

1262
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:46,040
of the gods and and here's how he

1263
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:46,470
conceptualized it psychologically he

1264
00:50:46,040 --> 00:50:49,650
thought

1265
00:50:46,470 --> 00:50:51,420
is what the ancient people who thought

1266
00:50:49,650 --> 00:50:52,680
about mercury has the winged messenger

1267
00:50:51,420 --> 00:50:54,210
of the gods were trying to state

1268
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:56,430
psychologically you know your your

1269
00:50:54,210 --> 00:50:58,260
interest Flitz around it's like there's

1270
00:50:56,430 --> 00:50:59,880
something that captures it and that

1271
00:50:58,260 --> 00:51:01,200
moves your interest from place to place

1272
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:02,550
you know like if you walk into a

1273
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:04,950
bookstore you'll get interested in a

1274
00:51:02,550 --> 00:51:06,840
particular book it's as if the book

1275
00:51:04,950 --> 00:51:08,400
grips you is you don't know why you're

1276
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:09,599
interested in that you might but often

1277
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:11,220
you don't know why you're interested in

1278
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:13,500
that book and you know your interest is

1279
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:15,150
flitting around and so that's mercury

1280
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:16,920
the thing that makes your interests like

1281
00:51:15,150 --> 00:51:20,070
flicker around is mercury the winged

1282
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:21,690
messenger of the gods and mercury is the

1283
00:51:20,070 --> 00:51:23,940
messenger of the gods because it's the

1284
00:51:21,690 --> 00:51:25,500
things behind the scenes psychologically

1285
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:27,750
that are manipulating your attention and

1286
00:51:25,500 --> 00:51:30,270
for Jung those were equivalent in some

1287
00:51:27,750 --> 00:51:33,660
sense to the lost gods and so for Jung

1288
00:51:30,270 --> 00:51:36,300
your your interest was being manipulated

1289
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:37,770
behind the scenes by unseen forces that

1290
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:39,420
were associated with your character

1291
00:51:37,770 --> 00:51:42,060
illogical development across time that

1292
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:45,450
was the manifestation of the self so the

1293
00:51:42,060 --> 00:51:47,490
self is this the the potential you let's

1294
00:51:45,450 --> 00:51:49,410
say and the way it operates in the

1295
00:51:47,490 --> 00:51:51,390
present is by gripping your interest in

1296
00:51:49,410 --> 00:51:53,580
directing it somewhere and that's part

1297
00:51:51,390 --> 00:51:55,980
of the instinct of self-realization

1298
00:51:53,580 --> 00:51:58,589
it's a mind-boggling idea man really

1299
00:51:55,980 --> 00:52:00,030
it's I think it's correct I can't see

1300
00:51:58,589 --> 00:52:01,800
how it can't be correct it doesn't mean

1301
00:52:00,030 --> 00:52:03,660
I understand it completely but it

1302
00:52:01,800 --> 00:52:06,690
certainly seems phenomenologically

1303
00:52:03,660 --> 00:52:08,700
correct and I mean the potential that

1304
00:52:06,690 --> 00:52:11,520
you are has to manifest itself somehow

1305
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:13,740
in in the here and now it has to and

1306
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:15,359
what better way than by directing your

1307
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:17,040
attention you know it's like it seems

1308
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:18,330
like this might be useful for you or

1309
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:20,400
maybe you get attracted to this person

1310
00:52:18,330 --> 00:52:22,020
or maybe you admire this person that

1311
00:52:20,400 --> 00:52:23,970
happens with kids a lot they'll admire

1312
00:52:22,020 --> 00:52:25,710
someone and then copy them and you can

1313
00:52:23,970 --> 00:52:28,020
see that that's obviously part of their

1314
00:52:25,710 --> 00:52:29,730
developmental progression right it's a

1315
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:31,440
form of hero worship but kids are very

1316
00:52:29,730 --> 00:52:34,050
imitative and they hero worship at the

1317
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:37,710
drop of a hat and so they're they're

1318
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:39,300
entranced by the the next stage of

1319
00:52:37,710 --> 00:52:41,250
development and if they see someone who

1320
00:52:39,300 --> 00:52:43,109
embodies that especially if it's in the

1321
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:44,990
zone of proximal development it's it's

1322
00:52:43,109 --> 00:52:47,430
um it's something they could achieve

1323
00:52:44,990 --> 00:52:49,230
stretching a bit they find someone who

1324
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:51,119
embodies that next stage of development

1325
00:52:49,230 --> 00:52:52,230
and then they start to imitate them and

1326
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:54,450
act like them

1327
00:52:52,230 --> 00:52:56,460
well we're adults are no different we're

1328
00:52:54,450 --> 00:52:58,530
no different we're just we do it at a

1329
00:52:56,460 --> 00:53:00,630
perhaps more abstract and sophisticated

1330
00:52:58,530 --> 00:53:05,760
level so okay

1331
00:53:00,630 --> 00:53:07,590
so Jacob and Esau are hostile brothers

1332
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:08,880
there they're like Cain and Abel except

1333
00:53:07,590 --> 00:53:12,030
the mixture of Cain and Abel and they're

1334
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:13,560
very different Esau was red and covered

1335
00:53:12,030 --> 00:53:15,300
with hair he was a hunter and a man of

1336
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:17,100
the field so he's like your basic jock

1337
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:18,930
right he's extroverted he's outgoing

1338
00:53:17,100 --> 00:53:21,810
he's really tough he's like

1339
00:53:18,930 --> 00:53:23,520
extraordinarily masculine he hunts and

1340
00:53:21,810 --> 00:53:27,240
he's a real favorite of his father and

1341
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:31,500
so and and Jacob isn't he's a dweller in

1342
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:34,680
tents and yeah right exactly exactly

1343
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:37,050
exactly right and it says Isaac loved

1344
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:38,670
Esau but Rebekah loved Jacob now that's

1345
00:53:37,050 --> 00:53:40,140
a problem right that that's a big

1346
00:53:38,670 --> 00:53:42,150
problem and that there's a Freudian

1347
00:53:40,140 --> 00:53:44,490
element to this it's like this family is

1348
00:53:42,150 --> 00:53:46,860
now divided because one child is the

1349
00:53:44,490 --> 00:53:48,480
favorite of the mother and that's Jacob

1350
00:53:46,860 --> 00:53:50,250
and one child is the favorite of the

1351
00:53:48,480 --> 00:53:53,250
father and so Jacob is kind of a

1352
00:53:50,250 --> 00:53:56,910
mother's boy I guess to use an rather

1353
00:53:53,250 --> 00:53:58,890
archaic phrase and certainly not as

1354
00:53:56,910 --> 00:54:01,170
admirable from his father's perspective

1355
00:53:58,890 --> 00:54:02,850
as Esau who's a tough guy who goes out

1356
00:54:01,170 --> 00:54:04,530
with a bow and arrow and like you know

1357
00:54:02,850 --> 00:54:07,320
wanders around in the plains and brings

1358
00:54:04,530 --> 00:54:11,520
animals home and and he's tough he's a

1359
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:14,190
tough guy so and but but there's this

1360
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:15,900
discord in the family because one parent

1361
00:54:14,190 --> 00:54:18,240
prefers one child and the other parent

1362
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:19,650
prefers the other and it's obvious from

1363
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:21,450
the story that the parents do not

1364
00:54:19,650 --> 00:54:23,220
communicate about this because they

1365
00:54:21,450 --> 00:54:25,650
really take sides and so there's a split

1366
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:28,050
in the family and that's I think very

1367
00:54:25,650 --> 00:54:29,730
realistic because one of the things that

1368
00:54:28,050 --> 00:54:31,170
you do learn if you have a family and of

1369
00:54:29,730 --> 00:54:33,270
course most of you do but if you also

1370
00:54:31,170 --> 00:54:36,060
think about families is that there's

1371
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:37,950
there's deep divisions within families

1372
00:54:36,060 --> 00:54:41,190
very very frequently that no one will

1373
00:54:37,950 --> 00:54:42,990
ever talk about and or even think about

1374
00:54:41,190 --> 00:54:45,090
often because it's too painful to think

1375
00:54:42,990 --> 00:54:46,860
about you know and Freud himself said

1376
00:54:45,090 --> 00:54:49,020
Freud was clearly his mother's favorite

1377
00:54:46,860 --> 00:54:51,090
and the family sacrificed a lot

1378
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:52,980
including some of the potential

1379
00:54:51,090 --> 00:54:54,810
ambitions of the other children in order

1380
00:54:52,980 --> 00:54:57,210
to kind of put Sigmund Freud up on a

1381
00:54:54,810 --> 00:54:59,310
pedestal and and advance his education

1382
00:54:57,210 --> 00:55:01,590
and it worked I mean you know he turned

1383
00:54:59,310 --> 00:55:03,690
into a great man but there was a cost to

1384
00:55:01,590 --> 00:55:05,370
his siblings and Freud himself said that

1385
00:55:03,690 --> 00:55:07,680
there was something about being the

1386
00:55:05,370 --> 00:55:10,920
favorite of the mother that gave a

1387
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:13,770
person additional confidence throughout

1388
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:15,120
their life and you know there's there's

1389
00:55:13,770 --> 00:55:16,830
something to be said about that even

1390
00:55:15,120 --> 00:55:18,810
someone like Eric Erickson you know he

1391
00:55:16,830 --> 00:55:20,730
noted that very interested in child

1392
00:55:18,810 --> 00:55:22,830
development that that first bonding with

1393
00:55:20,730 --> 00:55:25,080
the mother was the it was the place

1394
00:55:22,830 --> 00:55:26,970
where trust was established maybe trust

1395
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:29,220
even in the goodness of existence was

1396
00:55:26,970 --> 00:55:34,890
established and so anyways Jacob is

1397
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:42,690
Rachel's favorite and he saw his Isaac's

1398
00:55:34,890 --> 00:55:44,760
favorite now he saw being extroverted

1399
00:55:42,690 --> 00:55:47,640
let's say is also a bit impulsive and

1400
00:55:44,760 --> 00:55:50,250
maybe he's not he's a man of action he's

1401
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:52,200
not a forward thinker and but he's also

1402
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:53,910
doing hard work and so you know he goes

1403
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:56,070
out and he's hunting and he's worn out

1404
00:55:53,910 --> 00:56:00,270
and he comes home and he's faint with

1405
00:55:56,070 --> 00:56:02,900
hunger and Jacob is at home cooking

1406
00:56:00,270 --> 00:56:05,760
he's boiling up lentils red lentils and

1407
00:56:02,900 --> 00:56:07,980
you know Esau comes in from the hunt and

1408
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:10,440
he's like half starved to death and he's

1409
00:56:07,980 --> 00:56:13,620
sitting there in the aroma of these red

1410
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:18,240
lentils reaches them and he's exhausted

1411
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:23,340
and and and he tells Jacob that he wants

1412
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:25,680
some of this stew and Jacob who's being

1413
00:56:23,340 --> 00:56:27,960
a pain in the neck fundamentally they

1414
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:30,900
basically says no there's a there's a

1415
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:33,000
teasing thing going on here and and we

1416
00:56:30,900 --> 00:56:35,070
won't give him any and and and there's

1417
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:36,990
you have to imagine this because it's

1418
00:56:35,070 --> 00:56:40,740
not laid out explicitly in the story but

1419
00:56:36,990 --> 00:56:43,260
there's some dispute about whether Esau

1420
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:44,520
gets to have lunch and Jacob finally

1421
00:56:43,260 --> 00:56:46,170
says well I'll give you some but you

1422
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:46,680
have to you have to give me your

1423
00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:50,220
birthright

1424
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:52,740
and he saw you think he must say

1425
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:55,470
something like you know well to hell

1426
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:57,660
with it take it you know you son of a

1427
00:56:55,470 --> 00:57:00,420
 take it just give me some damn

1428
00:56:57,660 --> 00:57:01,740
stew it's something like that so that's

1429
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:03,540
what happens but you know with these

1430
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:05,250
archaic people once he made a statement

1431
00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:10,050
like that that was you were done that

1432
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:12,290
was it and so Esau sells his birthright

1433
00:57:10,050 --> 00:57:16,620
and this turns out to be incredibly

1434
00:57:12,290 --> 00:57:19,470
significant Manson who wrote biblical

1435
00:57:16,620 --> 00:57:22,200
commentary said oh there's a bit of a

1436
00:57:19,470 --> 00:57:23,940
twist to it so Esau eats the the red

1437
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:26,520
lentils and then from then on his name

1438
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:27,050
is red and you've got to use your

1439
00:57:26,520 --> 00:57:29,570
imagine

1440
00:57:27,050 --> 00:57:31,160
in a bit I mean people are making fun of

1441
00:57:29,570 --> 00:57:32,860
him right that's why they're calling him

1442
00:57:31,160 --> 00:57:35,060
red I mean he's already red because we

1443
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:36,890
established that but no one was calling

1444
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:39,500
him red before this and so for the rest

1445
00:57:36,890 --> 00:57:41,360
of his life you know every time he goes

1446
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:43,190
out amongst his friends and family they

1447
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:45,440
call him red and sort of snicker because

1448
00:57:43,190 --> 00:57:47,000
he's the you know half famished idiot

1449
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:49,760
who sold his birthright for a bowl of

1450
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:51,530
lentils and so it's it's not it's not

1451
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:54,290
that funny actually

1452
00:57:51,530 --> 00:57:56,030
and so Esau is not happy about this and

1453
00:57:54,290 --> 00:57:57,770
and it actually turns out that this so

1454
00:57:56,030 --> 00:57:59,390
what does it mean it means don't sell

1455
00:57:57,770 --> 00:58:01,430
the future for the desires of the

1456
00:57:59,390 --> 00:58:03,380
present and don't be casual about what

1457
00:58:01,430 --> 00:58:05,360
you have and then there's an archetypal

1458
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:07,340
element to this too and Benson says

1459
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:09,920
various have been the opinions what this

1460
00:58:07,340 --> 00:58:12,380
birthright was which Esau sold but the

1461
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:14,750
most probable is that together with the

1462
00:58:12,380 --> 00:58:16,910
right of sacrificing so determining what

1463
00:58:14,750 --> 00:58:19,490
should be sacrificed and when and being

1464
00:58:16,910 --> 00:58:21,620
the priest of the family it included the

1465
00:58:19,490 --> 00:58:24,200
peculiar blessing promised to the seed

1466
00:58:21,620 --> 00:58:26,360
of Abraham that of being the progenitor

1467
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:28,460
of the Messiah and the error of the

1468
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:31,100
special promises of God respecting

1469
00:58:28,460 --> 00:58:33,290
Christ's Kingdom it was at least typical

1470
00:58:31,100 --> 00:58:36,280
of spiritual privileges those of the

1471
00:58:33,290 --> 00:58:42,230
firstborn that are written in heaven

1472
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:44,510
well that's a lot harsher than meets the

1473
00:58:42,230 --> 00:58:49,040
eye to begin with and so there's a very

1474
00:58:44,510 --> 00:58:53,300
interesting deep moral story there which

1475
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:55,520
is it's sort of Esau does the opposite

1476
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:57,470
of a sacrifice it's the reverse right he

1477
00:58:55,520 --> 00:59:01,010
sacrifices the future for the present

1478
00:58:57,470 --> 00:59:03,080
and so the story basically says the way

1479
00:59:01,010 --> 00:59:06,100
it's laid out across stories is that if

1480
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:08,180
you're the sort of person that

1481
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:10,940
sacrifices the future to the present

1482
00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:14,480
then that eradicate the possibility that

1483
00:59:10,940 --> 00:59:16,940
you will bring the the most noble being

1484
00:59:14,480 --> 00:59:19,970
into existence that's what it means and

1485
00:59:16,940 --> 00:59:21,740
you can again this is the psychological

1486
00:59:19,970 --> 00:59:24,440
significance of the biblical story so

1487
00:59:21,740 --> 00:59:27,320
that's a bad thing to do if you want to

1488
00:59:24,440 --> 00:59:29,390
realize your potential let's say you

1489
00:59:27,320 --> 00:59:30,260
don't do reverse sacrifices that's a

1490
00:59:29,390 --> 00:59:33,250
very bad idea

1491
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:36,440
and so Esau really did himself in by

1492
00:59:33,250 --> 00:59:39,080
being too attached to the present

1493
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:40,340
without a vision of the future so he's -

1494
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:43,370
in the moment you know

1495
00:59:40,340 --> 00:59:45,650
and and he pays a heavy price for it I

1496
00:59:43,370 --> 00:59:47,390
mean he's the first of all he loses his

1497
00:59:45,650 --> 00:59:48,770
birthright and and his double

1498
00:59:47,390 --> 00:59:50,360
inheritance so there's a practical

1499
00:59:48,770 --> 00:59:53,150
consequence and then there's a spiritual

1500
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:55,220
consequence and then he's well he's been

1501
00:59:53,150 --> 00:59:58,730
made a fool of by his brother Jacob

1502
00:59:55,220 --> 01:00:00,800
means supplanter by the way that's what

1503
00:59:58,730 --> 01:00:03,770
the name means and Jacob is always

1504
01:00:00,800 --> 01:00:05,840
trying to usurp Esau as we see and so

1505
01:00:03,770 --> 01:00:07,580
Jacob gets one over on him and you know

1506
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:08,990
that's not doesn't make an older brother

1507
01:00:07,580 --> 01:00:10,400
happy when a younger brother gets

1508
01:00:08,990 --> 01:00:12,590
something over on him that's for sure

1509
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:14,360
and then he loses the opportunity to be

1510
01:00:12,590 --> 01:00:16,310
the progenitor of the Messiah which is

1511
01:00:14,360 --> 01:00:18,050
like people already didn't realize that

1512
01:00:16,310 --> 01:00:23,570
precisely but it seems to be you know

1513
01:00:18,050 --> 01:00:25,120
it's kind of rough that so and then

1514
01:00:23,570 --> 01:00:27,770
there's there's a statement in Matthew

1515
01:00:25,120 --> 01:00:29,240
16:26 for what is a man profited if he

1516
01:00:27,770 --> 01:00:31,730
shall gain the whole world and lose his

1517
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:33,560
own soul or what shall a man give in

1518
01:00:31,730 --> 01:00:35,390
exchange for a saw it's an echo of the

1519
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:38,360
same idea you know when you think well

1520
01:00:35,390 --> 01:00:40,850
what is this idea of soul mean and it's

1521
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:42,620
not intellect it said it's something

1522
01:00:40,850 --> 01:00:45,440
like it's something like consciousness

1523
01:00:42,620 --> 01:00:46,970
allied with character I think and I

1524
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:48,650
think the reason that it's valued so

1525
01:00:46,970 --> 01:00:49,940
much is that because you got to ask

1526
01:00:48,650 --> 01:00:51,710
yourself well what do you really have

1527
01:00:49,940 --> 01:00:53,660
when it comes down to it so life is

1528
01:00:51,710 --> 01:00:56,900
suffering let's say and you know you can

1529
01:00:53,660 --> 01:00:58,430
you can pile up worldly goods and the

1530
01:00:56,900 --> 01:00:59,870
God in the Old Testament doesn't seem to

1531
01:00:58,430 --> 01:01:02,630
have anything against that really right

1532
01:00:59,870 --> 01:01:05,030
the people who he favors seem to prosper

1533
01:01:02,630 --> 01:01:06,950
quite nicely in the world but they also

1534
01:01:05,030 --> 01:01:09,050
have to make a choice between whether

1535
01:01:06,950 --> 01:01:10,670
they're going to fundamentally sustain

1536
01:01:09,050 --> 01:01:12,620
their character or whether they're going

1537
01:01:10,670 --> 01:01:15,050
to prosper in the world when push comes

1538
01:01:12,620 --> 01:01:17,440
to shove and the idea constantly is that

1539
01:01:15,050 --> 01:01:20,690
really what you have in the world that

1540
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:22,490
allows you the best possible defense

1541
01:01:20,690 --> 01:01:24,530
against the suffering that's intrinsic

1542
01:01:22,490 --> 01:01:27,500
to being is your character that's what

1543
01:01:24,530 --> 01:01:29,180
you have period and I don't think there

1544
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:30,890
is anything that's more psychologically

1545
01:01:29,180 --> 01:01:33,140
true than that you know because

1546
01:01:30,890 --> 01:01:35,030
everything else well first of all your

1547
01:01:33,140 --> 01:01:37,280
relationships with others depend on your

1548
01:01:35,030 --> 01:01:38,810
character and certainly this is part of

1549
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:40,730
the story of Noah's Ark you know because

1550
01:01:38,810 --> 01:01:45,200
his generations were perfect so he had a

1551
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:47,120
very tight familial arrangement everyone

1552
01:01:45,200 --> 01:01:48,830
trusted each other that's a big deal if

1553
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:51,470
you hit a rocky patch in your life right

1554
01:01:48,830 --> 01:01:53,120
and it's character that it's character

1555
01:01:51,470 --> 01:01:54,109
that determines that you know if you're

1556
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:55,700
generous and honor

1557
01:01:54,109 --> 01:01:57,410
and all of those things and people know

1558
01:01:55,700 --> 01:01:58,819
they can rely on you assuming they're

1559
01:01:57,410 --> 01:02:01,130
not resentful that's a whole different

1560
01:01:58,819 --> 01:02:03,140
story then they're gonna come to your

1561
01:02:01,130 --> 01:02:05,029
aid when when it's necessary they're

1562
01:02:03,140 --> 01:02:06,499
gonna pull together with you and you

1563
01:02:05,029 --> 01:02:08,299
know when people are really after you

1564
01:02:06,499 --> 01:02:10,130
for one reason or another and they're

1565
01:02:08,299 --> 01:02:12,529
accusing you of all sorts of things and

1566
01:02:10,130 --> 01:02:14,329
you're guilty because you you have a

1567
01:02:12,529 --> 01:02:16,880
past it's laden with characterological

1568
01:02:14,329 --> 01:02:19,220
errors then it's very easy for people to

1569
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:20,869
take you down because they'll poke until

1570
01:02:19,220 --> 01:02:22,819
they hit a place where you're guilty and

1571
01:02:20,869 --> 01:02:24,619
then you're done because you'll do

1572
01:02:22,819 --> 01:02:28,069
yourself in with your own judgment and

1573
01:02:24,619 --> 01:02:35,539
so well so ESO makes a very big mistake

1574
01:02:28,069 --> 01:02:36,739
and there's a sacrificial idea here too

1575
01:02:35,539 --> 01:02:38,749
which is you know now and then you're

1576
01:02:36,739 --> 01:02:40,759
going to be faced with a situation where

1577
01:02:38,749 --> 01:02:42,140
it's something you really want or your

1578
01:02:40,759 --> 01:02:45,410
character maybe you'll have to lie about

1579
01:02:42,140 --> 01:02:47,210
something you know and you'll think what

1580
01:02:45,410 --> 01:02:50,420
difference does it make you know a lie

1581
01:02:47,210 --> 01:02:51,769
about it Jacob does this but the problem

1582
01:02:50,420 --> 01:02:53,809
there's a bunch of problems with that

1583
01:02:51,769 --> 01:02:55,190
one is that well now you know that

1584
01:02:53,809 --> 01:02:57,410
you're the sort of person that will in

1585
01:02:55,190 --> 01:02:59,989
fact deceive yourself about the nature

1586
01:02:57,410 --> 01:03:01,730
of reality if something shiny is dangled

1587
01:02:59,989 --> 01:03:03,140
in front of you and that's not good

1588
01:03:01,730 --> 01:03:04,819
because it undermines your faith in

1589
01:03:03,140 --> 01:03:06,739
yourself and when you're really in

1590
01:03:04,819 --> 01:03:08,390
trouble they call that the dark night of

1591
01:03:06,739 --> 01:03:10,640
the soul when you're really in trouble

1592
01:03:08,390 --> 01:03:12,200
that's what you've got you've got

1593
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:15,259
whether or not you can trust yourself

1594
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:16,970
and that's it you know when things are

1595
01:03:15,259 --> 01:03:20,089
really harsh and so if you've betrayed

1596
01:03:16,970 --> 01:03:21,170
yourself in that manner then you weaken

1597
01:03:20,089 --> 01:03:23,630
yourself under the worst possible

1598
01:03:21,170 --> 01:03:24,920
circumstances and that's just that's

1599
01:03:23,630 --> 01:03:29,779
really not a good thing

1600
01:03:24,920 --> 01:03:32,089
so this is very practical advice it's

1601
01:03:29,779 --> 01:03:33,559
not casual moralizing there's very

1602
01:03:32,089 --> 01:03:36,980
little casual moralizing in these

1603
01:03:33,559 --> 01:03:38,690
stories in the next part of this story

1604
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:40,400
there's some parallels with Abraham and

1605
01:03:38,690 --> 01:03:44,390
that's built into the narrative I think

1606
01:03:40,400 --> 01:03:47,299
because Isaac is Abraham's descendants

1607
01:03:44,390 --> 01:03:49,999
and so we have to keep the narrative

1608
01:03:47,299 --> 01:03:53,720
echoing forward otherwise it loses its

1609
01:03:49,999 --> 01:03:57,200
its continuity and there's a famine in

1610
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:58,489
the land that Isaac sin and God tells

1611
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:00,980
him to stay the course

1612
01:03:58,489 --> 01:04:01,609
anyways repeating the promise he he gave

1613
01:04:00,980 --> 01:04:05,299
to Abraham

1614
01:04:01,609 --> 01:04:06,680
although Isaac goes to AB Emelec also

1615
01:04:05,299 --> 01:04:07,940
telling the King and people that Rebecca

1616
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:09,350
was his sister

1617
01:04:07,940 --> 01:04:11,510
exactly what Abraham did when he went to

1618
01:04:09,350 --> 01:04:15,500
Egypt and so there's another echo there

1619
01:04:11,510 --> 01:04:17,210
of the same the same it's as if the

1620
01:04:15,500 --> 01:04:18,830
story is being told for a second time

1621
01:04:17,210 --> 01:04:20,930
essentially and that's supposed to

1622
01:04:18,830 --> 01:04:24,170
remind you of the of the previous story

1623
01:04:20,930 --> 01:04:27,050
but they're careless the King sees that

1624
01:04:24,170 --> 01:04:30,500
Rebekah and Isaac are intimate together

1625
01:04:27,050 --> 01:04:32,090
and luckily he doesn't have them put to

1626
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:33,320
death he just tells everybody in the

1627
01:04:32,090 --> 01:04:33,740
kingdom that they're to be left the hell

1628
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:37,010
alone

1629
01:04:33,740 --> 01:04:40,130
and then Isaac prospers in that land

1630
01:04:37,010 --> 01:04:41,960
just like Abraham did in Egypt until the

1631
01:04:40,130 --> 01:04:43,640
Philistines asked him to leave he's just

1632
01:04:41,960 --> 01:04:44,990
getting too rich and powerful things are

1633
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:48,950
going too well for him so he's asked to

1634
01:04:44,990 --> 01:04:51,770
he's asked to leave now in the meantime

1635
01:04:48,950 --> 01:04:54,410
Esau gets married Hannah this is a funny

1636
01:04:51,770 --> 01:04:56,000
little story he says he marries two

1637
01:04:54,410 --> 01:04:59,180
women who give grief to Isaac and

1638
01:04:56,000 --> 01:05:01,130
Rebekah so they who every so marries

1639
01:04:59,180 --> 01:05:03,920
they're not popular with his with their

1640
01:05:01,130 --> 01:05:05,600
in-laws not in the least that actually

1641
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:08,060
becomes relevant a little later because

1642
01:05:05,600 --> 01:05:09,770
they drive Rebekah quite mad so I get a

1643
01:05:08,060 --> 01:05:11,710
kick out of that because that's very

1644
01:05:09,770 --> 01:05:14,450
common you know it's not easy to

1645
01:05:11,710 --> 01:05:16,730
integrate new people into your family

1646
01:05:14,450 --> 01:05:17,810
and and hope that that will go smoothly

1647
01:05:16,730 --> 01:05:19,550
it's actually one of the real

1648
01:05:17,810 --> 01:05:21,860
catastrophes in life right you have a

1649
01:05:19,550 --> 01:05:24,740
kid maybe you get along with them and

1650
01:05:21,860 --> 01:05:26,240
maybe you don't but let's assume you do

1651
01:05:24,740 --> 01:05:29,120
but then they marry someone that you

1652
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:30,830
just don't like and or maybe you think

1653
01:05:29,120 --> 01:05:32,600
is wrong for them I mean that's really

1654
01:05:30,830 --> 01:05:35,210
rough that's what are you gonna do about

1655
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:37,370
that you know because you're you're

1656
01:05:35,210 --> 01:05:38,810
basically screwed both ways if you have

1657
01:05:37,370 --> 01:05:40,370
the person you love around then you have

1658
01:05:38,810 --> 01:05:42,560
to put up with this Prentis creature

1659
01:05:40,370 --> 01:05:44,120
that they allied themselves with and if

1660
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:45,920
you if you get rid of them completely

1661
01:05:44,120 --> 01:05:47,900
well then you know you don't have your

1662
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:50,000
child anymore so it's a very very

1663
01:05:47,900 --> 01:05:52,340
difficult position and so that's another

1664
01:05:50,000 --> 01:05:55,190
example of the realism I think of the

1665
01:05:52,340 --> 01:05:57,710
stories now Isaac who's hypothetically

1666
01:05:55,190 --> 01:05:59,480
on his deathbed asks Esau to hunt for

1667
01:05:57,710 --> 01:06:01,070
venison because he likes venison and

1668
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:02,960
he's happy that his son is a hunter and

1669
01:06:01,070 --> 01:06:08,540
Rebekah over here is this

1670
01:06:02,960 --> 01:06:11,960
and so she conspires with Jacob to to

1671
01:06:08,540 --> 01:06:14,630
slaughter two small goats and make his

1672
01:06:11,960 --> 01:06:16,250
father some stew because he wants Esau

1673
01:06:14,630 --> 01:06:19,760
to make him stew out of venison but

1674
01:06:16,250 --> 01:06:21,619
Rebecca who's being I would say let's

1675
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:23,180
say slightly deceitful or

1676
01:06:21,619 --> 01:06:26,210
probably lying that would be more

1677
01:06:23,180 --> 01:06:28,400
accurate she conspires with Jacob so

1678
01:06:26,210 --> 01:06:31,960
Jacob kills two little goats kids and

1679
01:06:28,400 --> 01:06:34,430
boils up a stew and then he puts on some

1680
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:37,640
goat skins because Esau is a hairy

1681
01:06:34,430 --> 01:06:40,970
character and and Rebecca dresses Isaac

1682
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:43,160
in Esau is clothing because Isaac can't

1683
01:06:40,970 --> 01:06:45,799
see very well at this point and so then

1684
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:48,529
Jacob goes into his father with the stew

1685
01:06:45,799 --> 01:06:51,259
and he's trying to disguise his voice

1686
01:06:48,529 --> 01:06:54,380
but it doesn't work very well and so

1687
01:06:51,259 --> 01:06:55,999
Isaac asks him to come close and Jacob

1688
01:06:54,380 --> 01:06:58,400
puts out his arm with the goat skin on

1689
01:06:55,999 --> 01:07:01,430
it and and Isaac smells him too and he

1690
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:05,210
smells like he's oh and which maybe

1691
01:07:01,430 --> 01:07:08,210
wasn't the best thing but and feels like

1692
01:07:05,210 --> 01:07:11,660
him and and so because Isaac thinks he's

1693
01:07:08,210 --> 01:07:16,180
on his deathbed he decides to deliver a

1694
01:07:11,660 --> 01:07:19,249
blessing - hypothetically - Esau and so

1695
01:07:16,180 --> 01:07:21,499
but it's Jacob and so that's a big deal

1696
01:07:19,249 --> 01:07:23,269
- because the blessing is actually as I

1697
01:07:21,499 --> 01:07:25,249
said before with these ancient people it

1698
01:07:23,269 --> 01:07:27,410
appeared as though once you said

1699
01:07:25,249 --> 01:07:29,150
something you didn't get to take it back

1700
01:07:27,410 --> 01:07:31,640
you couldn't say well look you've you

1701
01:07:29,150 --> 01:07:38,200
deceived me so it doesn't count

1702
01:07:31,640 --> 01:07:38,200
it was like they weren't maybe as as

1703
01:07:38,319 --> 01:07:42,109
what week might be one way of thinking

1704
01:07:40,730 --> 01:07:43,940
about it but another way is they weren't

1705
01:07:42,109 --> 01:07:46,009
quite as attentive to context you know

1706
01:07:43,940 --> 01:07:47,509
because if I make you a deal and then it

1707
01:07:46,009 --> 01:07:49,519
turns out that you've betrayed me I may

1708
01:07:47,509 --> 01:07:51,890
feel that the deal is no longer valid

1709
01:07:49,519 --> 01:07:53,539
because the assumption was you were

1710
01:07:51,890 --> 01:07:55,460
being honest to be giveth in that you

1711
01:07:53,539 --> 01:07:57,049
know violates the whole spirit but that

1712
01:07:55,460 --> 01:07:58,849
isn't how these people thought they said

1713
01:07:57,049 --> 01:08:03,049
once he promised man you promised and

1714
01:07:58,849 --> 01:08:05,720
that was that so Isaac blessed Jacob he

1715
01:08:03,049 --> 01:08:07,489
says that God give you the dew of heaven

1716
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:09,170
and the fatness of the earth and plenty

1717
01:08:07,489 --> 01:08:11,599
of corn and wine let let people serve

1718
01:08:09,170 --> 01:08:13,640
you and nations bow down to you be lord

1719
01:08:11,599 --> 01:08:15,920
over thy brethren that's gonna be rough

1720
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:17,929
on e so let thy mother's sons bow down

1721
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:20,139
to the cursed be everyone that curseth

1722
01:08:17,929 --> 01:08:23,060
thee and blessed be he the blesseth thee

1723
01:08:20,139 --> 01:08:25,609
and so there's a quite a remarkable

1724
01:08:23,060 --> 01:08:28,759
painting of that so there's Rebekah

1725
01:08:25,609 --> 01:08:31,520
she's looking pretty old and Isaac's

1726
01:08:28,759 --> 01:08:33,620
looking pretty blind and Jacobs taking

1727
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:35,359
directions from his mother and we might

1728
01:08:33,620 --> 01:08:35,719
say he's perhaps a little old to be

1729
01:08:35,359 --> 01:08:37,009
taking

1730
01:08:35,719 --> 01:08:39,349
moral lessons from his mother especially

1731
01:08:37,009 --> 01:08:41,299
given how she's acting and so it's a

1732
01:08:39,349 --> 01:08:44,239
pretty ugly scene altogether especially

1733
01:08:41,299 --> 01:08:46,699
that we also know that Jacob already

1734
01:08:44,239 --> 01:08:48,289
tricked Esau out of his birthright and

1735
01:08:46,699 --> 01:08:52,279
so now he's like taking the birthright

1736
01:08:48,289 --> 01:08:55,519
and he's taken the blessing and so as I

1737
01:08:52,279 --> 01:08:57,589
said that Jacob he turns out to be the

1738
01:08:55,519 --> 01:08:59,089
father of Israel it's like he's a

1739
01:08:57,589 --> 01:09:01,249
reprehensible character these are

1740
01:08:59,089 --> 01:09:03,309
major-league betrayals that he's

1741
01:09:01,249 --> 01:09:06,380
engaging and it's not trivial he really

1742
01:09:03,309 --> 01:09:07,670
really pulls the rug out from under his

1743
01:09:06,380 --> 01:09:10,489
brother and you know you could say well

1744
01:09:07,670 --> 01:09:12,559
Esau is not as awake as he might be you

1745
01:09:10,489 --> 01:09:14,869
know he's kind of a wild man and fair

1746
01:09:12,559 --> 01:09:18,199
enough but it certainly seems to me that

1747
01:09:14,869 --> 01:09:20,359
the the predominant moral error falls on

1748
01:09:18,199 --> 01:09:23,630
Jacobs shoulders it's very treacherous

1749
01:09:20,359 --> 01:09:25,460
behavior what he's doing so then he saw

1750
01:09:23,630 --> 01:09:29,029
shows up and he's got a nice stag for

1751
01:09:25,460 --> 01:09:32,119
his dad and it's like little late for

1752
01:09:29,029 --> 01:09:33,920
that and he states that his brother was

1753
01:09:32,119 --> 01:09:35,900
rightly named Jacob which means

1754
01:09:33,920 --> 01:09:40,130
supplanter because he's been deceived

1755
01:09:35,900 --> 01:09:42,920
twice and Isaac says Isaac answered he's

1756
01:09:40,130 --> 01:09:44,630
asking funny I was asking fundamentally

1757
01:09:42,920 --> 01:09:47,119
if there's anything at all left over for

1758
01:09:44,630 --> 01:09:48,440
him and Isaac can't give him the same

1759
01:09:47,119 --> 01:09:49,999
blessing because that's already been

1760
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:53,869
given so he has to think of something

1761
01:09:49,999 --> 01:09:56,539
else and Isaac says behold I've made him

1762
01:09:53,869 --> 01:09:58,550
thy Lord and all his brothers I've given

1763
01:09:56,539 --> 01:10:00,619
to him for servants which includes you

1764
01:09:58,550 --> 01:10:02,780
and with corn and wine have I sustained

1765
01:10:00,619 --> 01:10:05,360
him and what shall I now do unto thee my

1766
01:10:02,780 --> 01:10:07,369
son and Esau said unto his father have

1767
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:10,460
you even one blessing for me my father

1768
01:10:07,369 --> 01:10:12,289
and blessed me also and an e so lifted

1769
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:13,699
up his voice and wept and you know we

1770
01:10:12,289 --> 01:10:16,489
already know that Esau is a pretty tough

1771
01:10:13,699 --> 01:10:18,229
guy by all appearances and you know he's

1772
01:10:16,489 --> 01:10:19,909
out there hunting on his own and camping

1773
01:10:18,229 --> 01:10:21,710
and it's like he's no pushover and the

1774
01:10:19,909 --> 01:10:24,110
fact that this reduces him to tears is

1775
01:10:21,710 --> 01:10:27,110
an indication of the magnitude of the

1776
01:10:24,110 --> 01:10:28,610
betrayal and Isaac says behold thy

1777
01:10:27,110 --> 01:10:30,110
dwelling shall be the fatness of the

1778
01:10:28,610 --> 01:10:32,269
earth and of the dew of heaven from

1779
01:10:30,110 --> 01:10:34,670
above and by thy sword thou shalt live

1780
01:10:32,269 --> 01:10:36,050
and thou shalt serve your brother and it

1781
01:10:34,670 --> 01:10:37,999
shall come to pass when you will have

1782
01:10:36,050 --> 01:10:40,249
the Dominion and you'll break the yoke

1783
01:10:37,999 --> 01:10:41,989
his yoke off from thy neck and Esau

1784
01:10:40,249 --> 01:10:43,820
hated Jacob because of the blessing

1785
01:10:41,989 --> 01:10:46,340
wherewith his father blessed him and

1786
01:10:43,820 --> 01:10:48,469
Esau said in his heart the days of

1787
01:10:46,340 --> 01:10:49,530
mourning for my father are at hand then

1788
01:10:48,469 --> 01:10:53,520
I will slay my

1789
01:10:49,530 --> 01:10:56,250
Jakub so fundamentally you know if Isaac

1790
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:58,290
dies or when he dies then we'll mourn

1791
01:10:56,250 --> 01:11:00,540
for him and then Jacob better look the

1792
01:10:58,290 --> 01:11:04,620
hell out because it's like it's it's

1793
01:11:00,540 --> 01:11:07,830
serious death coming his way and you

1794
01:11:04,620 --> 01:11:10,020
know he's got a he's got a point he's in

1795
01:11:07,830 --> 01:11:12,090
in Dante's Inferno I think I mentioned

1796
01:11:10,020 --> 01:11:13,950
this at one point so Dante's Inferno

1797
01:11:12,090 --> 01:11:14,850
it's a very interesting story it's a

1798
01:11:13,950 --> 01:11:17,670
descent into hell

1799
01:11:14,850 --> 01:11:19,680
and it's it's actually one of the places

1800
01:11:17,670 --> 01:11:21,870
that we sort of derive the popular

1801
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:24,420
conception of Hell was partly based on

1802
01:11:21,870 --> 01:11:26,760
Dante's on Dante's imagination on his

1803
01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:28,710
work and what Dante was trying to do was

1804
01:11:26,760 --> 01:11:30,570
to discover the hierarchical structure

1805
01:11:28,710 --> 01:11:32,220
of evil and you know you might think

1806
01:11:30,570 --> 01:11:33,660
there's a hierarchical structure of good

1807
01:11:32,220 --> 01:11:35,430
some things are better than other things

1808
01:11:33,660 --> 01:11:37,410
but there's also a hierarchical

1809
01:11:35,430 --> 01:11:39,720
structure of evil some evils are greater

1810
01:11:37,410 --> 01:11:41,940
than other evils and he put betrayal in

1811
01:11:39,720 --> 01:11:43,950
the in the in the lowest part of health

1812
01:11:41,940 --> 01:11:46,170
right so if you were betraying people

1813
01:11:43,950 --> 01:11:48,720
you were right besides Satan himself and

1814
01:11:46,170 --> 01:11:51,110
so and I think that's good that's very

1815
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:54,390
smart well Dante was a genius after all

1816
01:11:51,110 --> 01:11:57,570
and I think the reason for that is that

1817
01:11:54,390 --> 01:11:59,490
you see if someone trusts you they're

1818
01:11:57,570 --> 01:12:01,440
laying their vulnerability open to you

1819
01:11:59,490 --> 01:12:03,660
now they might just be naive let's say

1820
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:05,430
and that's we won't think about that

1821
01:12:03,660 --> 01:12:07,710
because you're just a child if you're

1822
01:12:05,430 --> 01:12:09,600
naive you can still be betrayed but if

1823
01:12:07,710 --> 01:12:11,610
you're an adult and you trust it's often

1824
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:14,040
because you if you're an actual adult

1825
01:12:11,610 --> 01:12:15,990
its you willingly open yourself up

1826
01:12:14,040 --> 01:12:17,970
knowing that you could be hurt right

1827
01:12:15,990 --> 01:12:19,950
because you're not naive anymore so you

1828
01:12:17,970 --> 01:12:23,070
decide to trust and you see all open

1829
01:12:19,950 --> 01:12:25,830
myself up and I know that I'm laying

1830
01:12:23,070 --> 01:12:27,660
myself open to you if you choose to use

1831
01:12:25,830 --> 01:12:29,160
that power and then that's a good thing

1832
01:12:27,660 --> 01:12:31,350
to know you know if you've been hurt as

1833
01:12:29,160 --> 01:12:32,460
a child or hurt as a naive person you

1834
01:12:31,350 --> 01:12:34,290
might say well why should I ever trust

1835
01:12:32,460 --> 01:12:36,660
again which is a really good question

1836
01:12:34,290 --> 01:12:38,340
and the answer is the reason you trust

1837
01:12:36,660 --> 01:12:41,070
again once you're an adult is because

1838
01:12:38,340 --> 01:12:43,650
you're courageous you're courageous

1839
01:12:41,070 --> 01:12:46,350
it's an act of courage to trust and the

1840
01:12:43,650 --> 01:12:48,030
reason it's useful is because if you

1841
01:12:46,350 --> 01:12:50,840
trust someone you open the door to

1842
01:12:48,030 --> 01:12:54,180
reciprocity and negotiation and

1843
01:12:50,840 --> 01:12:56,940
cooperation and you entice the best part

1844
01:12:54,180 --> 01:12:59,670
of the person forward and so it's a it's

1845
01:12:56,940 --> 01:13:02,220
a courageous act but then if you betray

1846
01:12:59,670 --> 01:13:03,349
someone then what you've done is you've

1847
01:13:02,220 --> 01:13:04,639
taken the best part

1848
01:13:03,349 --> 01:13:07,099
them which is the part that will

1849
01:13:04,639 --> 01:13:09,919
courageously trust you know with open

1850
01:13:07,099 --> 01:13:12,349
eyes right and you've stuck a dagger in

1851
01:13:09,919 --> 01:13:14,929
that and so you've purposefully damaged

1852
01:13:12,349 --> 01:13:19,070
the best part of them and so that's why

1853
01:13:14,929 --> 01:13:20,719
it's such a egregious fault and and it's

1854
01:13:19,070 --> 01:13:22,399
often people don't recover from that

1855
01:13:20,719 --> 01:13:24,379
sort of playing at you if you betray

1856
01:13:22,399 --> 01:13:26,119
someone badly enough you can you can

1857
01:13:24,379 --> 01:13:27,769
damage them like you can give them

1858
01:13:26,119 --> 01:13:29,629
post-traumatic stress disorder if you

1859
01:13:27,769 --> 01:13:31,159
really if you really put your mind to it

1860
01:13:29,629 --> 01:13:33,199
and you know that's not just a

1861
01:13:31,159 --> 01:13:34,639
psychological disorder if you have

1862
01:13:33,199 --> 01:13:36,169
post-traumatic stress disorder it

1863
01:13:34,639 --> 01:13:38,840
produces permanent neurological

1864
01:13:36,169 --> 01:13:40,879
alterations that make you more neurotic

1865
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:42,739
more sensitive to negative emotion

1866
01:13:40,879 --> 01:13:45,619
really for the rest of your life like

1867
01:13:42,739 --> 01:13:49,219
you can you can recover from it to some

1868
01:13:45,619 --> 01:13:53,149
degree but stress will tend to reinstate

1869
01:13:49,219 --> 01:13:55,309
the PTSD so you you hurt someone and

1870
01:13:53,149 --> 01:13:57,019
it's not merely cycled not not that

1871
01:13:55,309 --> 01:13:59,030
psychological is merely but it's not

1872
01:13:57,019 --> 01:14:01,419
merely psychological right it's it's

1873
01:13:59,030 --> 01:14:05,329
fundamental physiological damage

1874
01:14:01,419 --> 01:14:08,179
so anyways Jacobs smart enough to get

1875
01:14:05,329 --> 01:14:10,369
out of there and which is also not

1876
01:14:08,179 --> 01:14:13,399
really a testament to his integrity

1877
01:14:10,369 --> 01:14:15,199
right I mean he's done these terrible

1878
01:14:13,399 --> 01:14:18,649
things at the behest of his mother

1879
01:14:15,199 --> 01:14:20,239
because he wants power and and he wants

1880
01:14:18,649 --> 01:14:22,369
to get it without deserving it and then

1881
01:14:20,239 --> 01:14:25,249
you know he finally goes too far and he

1882
01:14:22,369 --> 01:14:27,010
hightailed it out of there to his to

1883
01:14:25,249 --> 01:14:31,729
another family member to his mother's

1884
01:14:27,010 --> 01:14:34,760
brother and so it's not exactly the

1885
01:14:31,729 --> 01:14:36,889
world's most heroic story that's for

1886
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:38,300
sure and so now there's an interlude

1887
01:14:36,889 --> 01:14:41,059
here and this is a really interesting

1888
01:14:38,300 --> 01:14:44,179
interlude it's the story of Jacob's

1889
01:14:41,059 --> 01:14:47,659
Ladder so he's off to visit Lebon or lab

1890
01:14:44,179 --> 01:14:51,979
and who's his his mother's brother and

1891
01:14:47,659 --> 01:14:53,719
on the way he he has asleep and he

1892
01:14:51,979 --> 01:14:55,639
lighted upon a certain place and tarried

1893
01:14:53,719 --> 01:14:57,439
there all night because the Sun was set

1894
01:14:55,639 --> 01:14:59,780
and he took of the stones of that place

1895
01:14:57,439 --> 01:15:01,760
and put them for his pillows which seems

1896
01:14:59,780 --> 01:15:04,519
to indicate very bad planning on on his

1897
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:07,010
part and and lay down in that place to

1898
01:15:04,519 --> 01:15:08,719
sleep and he dreamed and beheld a ladder

1899
01:15:07,010 --> 01:15:10,760
set up on the earth and the top of it

1900
01:15:08,719 --> 01:15:12,590
reached to heaven and beheld the angels

1901
01:15:10,760 --> 01:15:14,629
of God ascending and descending on it

1902
01:15:12,590 --> 01:15:16,429
and behold the Lord stood above it and

1903
01:15:14,629 --> 01:15:16,790
said I am the Lord God of Abraham thy

1904
01:15:16,429 --> 01:15:19,460
far

1905
01:15:16,790 --> 01:15:21,680
and the guard of Isaac the land were on

1906
01:15:19,460 --> 01:15:26,090
thou liest to thee I will give it and to

1907
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:28,070
thy seed and so this story of Jacob's

1908
01:15:26,090 --> 01:15:30,410
Ladder has really possessed the

1909
01:15:28,070 --> 01:15:31,970
imagination of the West and there's a

1910
01:15:30,410 --> 01:15:34,130
reason for that it's because it's an

1911
01:15:31,970 --> 01:15:35,840
archetypal story because the idea of a

1912
01:15:34,130 --> 01:15:38,600
ladder that reaches to heaven is one of

1913
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:40,370
the oldest ideas of mankind so you find

1914
01:15:38,600 --> 01:15:42,410
it widely distributed among the shamanic

1915
01:15:40,370 --> 01:15:44,630
cultures for example and it's a hallmark

1916
01:15:42,410 --> 01:15:46,340
of psychedelic experience that's another

1917
01:15:44,630 --> 01:15:48,280
way of thinking about it which is a very

1918
01:15:46,340 --> 01:15:50,750
peculiar thing so there's one

1919
01:15:48,280 --> 01:15:53,540
representation of of the ladder you see

1920
01:15:50,750 --> 01:15:56,210
god up at the top there peeking out from

1921
01:15:53,540 --> 01:15:59,600
the clouds now you know that's sort of

1922
01:15:56,210 --> 01:16:01,190
where we get the idea that God is in in

1923
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:04,760
heaven and then heavens up in the sky

1924
01:16:01,190 --> 01:16:06,830
and and that's an easy story to make fun

1925
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:08,990
of because you know we've gone up to the

1926
01:16:06,830 --> 01:16:12,860
moon and there's no God there and and

1927
01:16:08,990 --> 01:16:15,350
but but this this is not a reasonable

1928
01:16:12,860 --> 01:16:18,020
way of conceptualizing what these

1929
01:16:15,350 --> 01:16:20,870
experiences are about these experiences

1930
01:16:18,020 --> 01:16:23,270
what this is the opening up there that's

1931
01:16:20,870 --> 01:16:24,560
more like an opening into an alternate

1932
01:16:23,270 --> 01:16:26,480
dimension that's a better way of

1933
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:28,280
thinking about it's beyond like from

1934
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:29,600
from the judeo-christian perspective one

1935
01:16:28,280 --> 01:16:31,730
of the things you have to understand is

1936
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:34,010
that God is beyond space and time he's

1937
01:16:31,730 --> 01:16:37,040
not in the universe he's outside the

1938
01:16:34,010 --> 01:16:38,930
universe in some manner and so the idea

1939
01:16:37,040 --> 01:16:41,840
that that you have an experience of God

1940
01:16:38,930 --> 01:16:44,390
and it's up isn't the OP is the best

1941
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:46,280
that the human imagination can do with

1942
01:16:44,390 --> 01:16:48,890
what's essentially a form of extra

1943
01:16:46,280 --> 01:16:50,990
dimensional experience or that's the

1944
01:16:48,890 --> 01:16:52,850
best way to conceptualize it and these

1945
01:16:50,990 --> 01:16:54,890
experiences aren't rare you know they

1946
01:16:52,850 --> 01:16:57,140
they make the they make up the core of

1947
01:16:54,890 --> 01:16:59,150
of the shamanic tradition and so there's

1948
01:16:57,140 --> 01:17:00,980
an intrusion of the ancient shamanic

1949
01:16:59,150 --> 01:17:01,580
tradition which is tens of thousands of

1950
01:17:00,980 --> 01:17:04,280
years old

1951
01:17:01,580 --> 01:17:08,270
into the biblical stories at this point

1952
01:17:04,280 --> 01:17:09,950
now why Jacob had a essentially shamanic

1953
01:17:08,270 --> 01:17:11,480
experience is very difficult to tell

1954
01:17:09,950 --> 01:17:12,980
because we don't know what these old

1955
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:15,760
people were up to right and we don't

1956
01:17:12,980 --> 01:17:18,410
know how much of the archaic tradition

1957
01:17:15,760 --> 01:17:21,050
archaic religious tradition was still

1958
01:17:18,410 --> 01:17:22,850
extant about at that point in time but

1959
01:17:21,050 --> 01:17:26,330
we certainly do know that our ancient

1960
01:17:22,850 --> 01:17:28,370
forebears were using psychedelic

1961
01:17:26,330 --> 01:17:30,110
substances constantly like Amanita

1962
01:17:28,370 --> 01:17:30,440
muscaria mushrooms for example which

1963
01:17:30,110 --> 01:17:32,510
were

1964
01:17:30,440 --> 01:17:34,850
widely used in India before they became

1965
01:17:32,510 --> 01:17:36,770
extinct that's the theory anyways that

1966
01:17:34,850 --> 01:17:39,320
seemed to be the basis of the chemical

1967
01:17:36,770 --> 01:17:43,640
soma which much has been written about

1968
01:17:39,320 --> 01:17:45,320
and so we here ever this as a dream that

1969
01:17:43,640 --> 01:17:46,910
were as a vision and perhaps that's what

1970
01:17:45,320 --> 01:17:49,340
it was but perhaps that wasn't what it

1971
01:17:46,910 --> 01:17:53,540
was either and perhaps it was an

1972
01:17:49,340 --> 01:17:57,469
experience that was induced by or by the

1973
01:17:53,540 --> 01:17:59,150
same processes that shamanic people have

1974
01:17:57,469 --> 01:18:00,260
always induced these experiences and so

1975
01:17:59,150 --> 01:18:02,660
we're gonna go through this a little bit

1976
01:18:00,260 --> 01:18:04,070
so anyways there's a there's a

1977
01:18:02,660 --> 01:18:06,920
connection between heaven and earth that

1978
01:18:04,070 --> 01:18:09,770
opens up that's that's that's the that's

1979
01:18:06,920 --> 01:18:11,239
the vision and there's messengers moving

1980
01:18:09,770 --> 01:18:13,310
up and down now one way you can

1981
01:18:11,239 --> 01:18:15,739
conceptualize that is psychologically as

1982
01:18:13,310 --> 01:18:18,530
we already discussed that you know there

1983
01:18:15,739 --> 01:18:21,199
there are forces within you that are

1984
01:18:18,530 --> 01:18:23,090
active and alive and you can think of

1985
01:18:21,199 --> 01:18:25,040
them in some sense as messengers of the

1986
01:18:23,090 --> 01:18:27,170
higher self and so you could think about

1987
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:30,500
this as an image of a psychological

1988
01:18:27,170 --> 01:18:35,000
reality but and so we can stick with

1989
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:36,770
that but but here's some of the

1990
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:39,440
representations that have been made I

1991
01:18:36,770 --> 01:18:42,920
really like the one on the right that's

1992
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:45,680
William Blake I like the helix idea and

1993
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:47,480
I don't think that that's that's fluke

1994
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:49,910
there are helixes and double helixes and

1995
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:51,710
all sorts of imaging imagery very

1996
01:18:49,910 --> 01:18:53,420
ancient and very modern that are

1997
01:18:51,710 --> 01:18:56,330
associated with both healing and with

1998
01:18:53,420 --> 01:18:58,880
this kind of vision so and you see it in

1999
01:18:56,330 --> 01:19:01,310
the Blake representation God is

2000
01:18:58,880 --> 01:19:03,860
associated with well really with the Sun

2001
01:19:01,310 --> 01:19:06,410
and with light and and you see that on

2002
01:19:03,860 --> 01:19:08,150
the left as well that wherever God is is

2003
01:19:06,410 --> 01:19:09,890
where light is and so that's a very

2004
01:19:08,150 --> 01:19:11,870
interesting idea as far as I'm concerned

2005
01:19:09,890 --> 01:19:19,750
as well there's some other

2006
01:19:11,870 --> 01:19:19,750
representations one by Chanel

2007
01:19:22,710 --> 01:19:27,310
so now there's this idea that there's a

2008
01:19:25,210 --> 01:19:29,200
there's the possibility of opening up a

2009
01:19:27,310 --> 01:19:31,350
line of communication between the human

2010
01:19:29,200 --> 01:19:34,390
psyche and the transcendent divine and

2011
01:19:31,350 --> 01:19:36,370
there's a there's a great image of

2012
01:19:34,390 --> 01:19:38,050
Christ as Pam - they're so creator of

2013
01:19:36,370 --> 01:19:40,600
the world that is one of the first

2014
01:19:38,050 --> 01:19:42,460
mosaics if I remember correctly and I

2015
01:19:40,600 --> 01:19:44,560
wish I knew remember where it was but I

2016
01:19:42,460 --> 01:19:46,810
don't but it's a very interesting image

2017
01:19:44,560 --> 01:19:50,110
I'm having a carving of it made at the

2018
01:19:46,810 --> 01:19:53,590
moment by a friend of mine but you see

2019
01:19:50,110 --> 01:19:56,170
Christ's face portrayed in a medieval

2020
01:19:53,590 --> 01:19:58,330
manner and he's holding a book so it

2021
01:19:56,170 --> 01:20:00,430
symbolizes the importance of the book

2022
01:19:58,330 --> 01:20:03,400
you know as a means of transmitting

2023
01:20:00,430 --> 01:20:06,100
wisdom and his face is very asymmetrical

2024
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:08,230
and that the eyes are different one side

2025
01:20:06,100 --> 01:20:10,180
and the other and one half of the face

2026
01:20:08,230 --> 01:20:12,370
represents the human part and the other

2027
01:20:10,180 --> 01:20:14,770
side of the face represents the divine

2028
01:20:12,370 --> 01:20:17,620
part and you know I also think about

2029
01:20:14,770 --> 01:20:19,600
that psychologically because I do think

2030
01:20:17,620 --> 01:20:21,580
that that's the right way to

2031
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:23,890
conceptualize human beings is that

2032
01:20:21,580 --> 01:20:25,540
there's an aspect of us that's mortal

2033
01:20:23,890 --> 01:20:27,280
and human and limited but there's an

2034
01:20:25,540 --> 01:20:29,739
aspect of us that's transcendent and

2035
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:31,570
divine as well and it's latent in some

2036
01:20:29,739 --> 01:20:33,480
sense but there are times when it

2037
01:20:31,570 --> 01:20:37,000
manifests itself and this is not

2038
01:20:33,480 --> 01:20:39,190
speculation right this is like the

2039
01:20:37,000 --> 01:20:41,170
oldest experience of human beings now

2040
01:20:39,190 --> 01:20:44,140
it's not necessarily an easy experience

2041
01:20:41,170 --> 01:20:46,239
to have but it's reported everywhere and

2042
01:20:44,140 --> 01:20:48,190
it can be reliably induced as we've

2043
01:20:46,239 --> 01:20:50,260
discussed before by chemical means which

2044
01:20:48,190 --> 01:20:51,370
and I don't know what that means exactly

2045
01:20:50,260 --> 01:20:53,830
we've talked a little bit about

2046
01:20:51,370 --> 01:20:55,840
psilocybin mushrooms for example and you

2047
01:20:53,830 --> 01:20:57,250
could say that the mystical experiences

2048
01:20:55,840 --> 01:21:00,780
that have been invoked in the newest

2049
01:20:57,250 --> 01:21:03,640
experiments down it Johns Hopkins are

2050
01:21:00,780 --> 01:21:05,770
arrangements or forms of psychosis you

2051
01:21:03,640 --> 01:21:08,670
know because they have some similarity

2052
01:21:05,770 --> 01:21:11,080
to psycho psychotic experiences although

2053
01:21:08,670 --> 01:21:13,270
psychotic people were given LSD in the

2054
01:21:11,080 --> 01:21:14,590
60s and they always said that that was

2055
01:21:13,270 --> 01:21:16,930
something different than what they were

2056
01:21:14,590 --> 01:21:18,580
having and if you give psychotic people

2057
01:21:16,930 --> 01:21:21,250
amphetamines you could make them worse

2058
01:21:18,580 --> 01:21:23,200
so their bio chemically separate and we

2059
01:21:21,250 --> 01:21:24,460
know that and but also the thing that's

2060
01:21:23,200 --> 01:21:27,070
so interesting about the psilocybin

2061
01:21:24,460 --> 01:21:28,989
experience is is that they reliably

2062
01:21:27,070 --> 01:21:30,730
produce mystical experiences that the

2063
01:21:28,989 --> 01:21:33,460
people rate as among the most important

2064
01:21:30,730 --> 01:21:34,510
experiences of their life and among

2065
01:21:33,460 --> 01:21:36,940
those who have

2066
01:21:34,510 --> 01:21:39,340
the psychedelic experience positive

2067
01:21:36,940 --> 01:21:41,020
things happen to them and so that kind

2068
01:21:39,340 --> 01:21:42,430
of messes with the whole psychosis

2069
01:21:41,020 --> 01:21:44,530
theory right because what are you gonna

2070
01:21:42,430 --> 01:21:45,970
do you got a claim that you give someone

2071
01:21:44,530 --> 01:21:47,710
a pill and they have a psychotic break

2072
01:21:45,970 --> 01:21:49,810
and then they're healthier it's like no

2073
01:21:47,710 --> 01:21:51,940
that isn't how psychotic breaks work

2074
01:21:49,810 --> 01:21:54,310
you're not healthy or after having one

2075
01:21:51,940 --> 01:21:57,010
you're like you're a broken egg and it's

2076
01:21:54,310 --> 01:21:59,110
not easy to put you back together so and

2077
01:21:57,010 --> 01:22:00,820
we know that people all over the world

2078
01:21:59,110 --> 01:22:02,770
have discovered every manner of

2079
01:22:00,820 --> 01:22:04,660
psychedelic substance that you could

2080
01:22:02,770 --> 01:22:06,250
possibly while you imagine there's lots

2081
01:22:04,660 --> 01:22:07,660
of hungry people wandering the earth for

2082
01:22:06,250 --> 01:22:09,190
a long time and they eat every damn

2083
01:22:07,660 --> 01:22:11,350
thing they could get their hands on and

2084
01:22:09,190 --> 01:22:17,950
now and then something very peculiar

2085
01:22:11,350 --> 01:22:19,120
happened as a consequence so so I'm

2086
01:22:17,950 --> 01:22:22,090
gonna tell you a little bit about the

2087
01:22:19,120 --> 01:22:24,570
shamanic tradition because it's

2088
01:22:22,090 --> 01:22:27,070
associated with Jacob's Ladder so

2089
01:22:24,570 --> 01:22:28,830
according to le a de murcia le odd it

2090
01:22:27,070 --> 01:22:31,240
was a great historian of religion a

2091
01:22:28,830 --> 01:22:32,530
comparative Jung's and and and they

2092
01:22:31,240 --> 01:22:34,420
influenced each other quite

2093
01:22:32,530 --> 01:22:37,120
substantially le otta believed that

2094
01:22:34,420 --> 01:22:40,210
shamanism that used psychedelics was a

2095
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:42,550
degeneration from the original more pure

2096
01:22:40,210 --> 01:22:44,140
shamanism but I think later scholarship

2097
01:22:42,550 --> 01:22:47,140
has demonstrated that that's incorrect

2098
01:22:44,140 --> 01:22:49,360
that that the shamanic ritual per se was

2099
01:22:47,140 --> 01:22:52,330
a direct consequence of the use

2100
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:54,130
discovery of an and ritualistic use of

2101
01:22:52,330 --> 01:22:58,140
psychedelic substances but anyways

2102
01:22:54,130 --> 01:23:00,460
Eliana identified three pathways to

2103
01:22:58,140 --> 01:23:04,290
shamanism and the shaman in it in a

2104
01:23:00,460 --> 01:23:08,230
tribe was more educated than the typical

2105
01:23:04,290 --> 01:23:10,510
person with a larger vocabulary and was

2106
01:23:08,230 --> 01:23:13,570
the repository of the oral tradition and

2107
01:23:10,510 --> 01:23:16,450
so learned all the stories that had been

2108
01:23:13,570 --> 01:23:19,000
passed down word to mouth and people by

2109
01:23:16,450 --> 01:23:20,920
the way are very very can very very

2110
01:23:19,000 --> 01:23:22,570
accurately tell the same story across

2111
01:23:20,920 --> 01:23:25,930
generations that's been quite well

2112
01:23:22,570 --> 01:23:28,330
documented so and and people who can't

2113
01:23:25,930 --> 01:23:30,250
read really can remember because what

2114
01:23:28,330 --> 01:23:32,470
else are they going to do their memories

2115
01:23:30,250 --> 01:23:33,670
are far greater than modern people's

2116
01:23:32,470 --> 01:23:34,870
memories because we can forget

2117
01:23:33,670 --> 01:23:37,540
everything because we can just look it

2118
01:23:34,870 --> 01:23:39,400
up but they remembered things because

2119
01:23:37,540 --> 01:23:42,520
they had no choice my father knew

2120
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:45,370
someone who was illiterate and and and

2121
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:47,300
and couldn't use numbers either when he

2122
01:23:45,370 --> 01:23:50,989
grew up in Saskatchewan

2123
01:23:47,300 --> 01:23:52,940
you know sixty years ago and he was a he

2124
01:23:50,989 --> 01:23:54,739
had a sheep if I remember correctly and

2125
01:23:52,940 --> 01:23:56,659
although he couldn't count he knew if

2126
01:23:54,739 --> 01:23:58,670
one of his sheep was missing because he

2127
01:23:56,659 --> 01:24:00,409
knew all the sheep and so he could tell

2128
01:23:58,670 --> 01:24:02,710
just by looking if one of the sheep was

2129
01:24:00,409 --> 01:24:05,030
missing but he couldn't count and so

2130
01:24:02,710 --> 01:24:06,980
well so people who don't have our

2131
01:24:05,030 --> 01:24:08,480
particular set of skills first of all

2132
01:24:06,980 --> 01:24:10,460
they're not stupid and second they have

2133
01:24:08,480 --> 01:24:13,460
other skills that we don't understand to

2134
01:24:10,460 --> 01:24:16,190
fill in the gaps so le ah de identified

2135
01:24:13,460 --> 01:24:18,020
spontaneous vocation so you were just

2136
01:24:16,190 --> 01:24:19,550
you have this spirit of a shaman let's

2137
01:24:18,020 --> 01:24:21,050
say so you're probably extremely high in

2138
01:24:19,550 --> 01:24:23,449
openness let's say from a modern

2139
01:24:21,050 --> 01:24:25,489
perspective hereditary transmission so

2140
01:24:23,449 --> 01:24:26,960
you know your father was a shaman and

2141
01:24:25,489 --> 01:24:28,760
your grandfather was a shaman and so

2142
01:24:26,960 --> 01:24:33,829
forth and you got initiated into that

2143
01:24:28,760 --> 01:24:36,199
process or a personal quest in Siberia

2144
01:24:33,829 --> 01:24:38,690
this is from Ileana in Siberia the youth

2145
01:24:36,199 --> 01:24:41,210
who is called to be a shaman attracts

2146
01:24:38,690 --> 01:24:42,770
attention by his strange behavior for

2147
01:24:41,210 --> 01:24:44,449
example he seeks solitude becomes

2148
01:24:42,770 --> 01:24:46,790
absent-minded loves to roam in the woods

2149
01:24:44,449 --> 01:24:48,469
or unfrequented places has visions and

2150
01:24:46,790 --> 01:24:50,780
sings in his sleep you know if you put

2151
01:24:48,469 --> 01:24:53,750
someone in a place that's deprived

2152
01:24:50,780 --> 01:24:56,329
that's where you're you're deprived from

2153
01:24:53,750 --> 01:24:58,579
a sensory perspective it normal people

2154
01:24:56,329 --> 01:25:00,230
will hallucinate quite quickly so it

2155
01:24:58,579 --> 01:25:02,809
seems what happens is that if you dampen

2156
01:25:00,230 --> 01:25:04,550
down the sensory input then you start to

2157
01:25:02,809 --> 01:25:05,900
become aware of the background processes

2158
01:25:04,550 --> 01:25:07,849
of your mind it's something like that

2159
01:25:05,900 --> 01:25:11,559
it's like the signal-to-noise ratio I

2160
01:25:07,849 --> 01:25:14,540
got to get this right as the noise

2161
01:25:11,559 --> 01:25:16,250
decreases some of the noise becomes

2162
01:25:14,540 --> 01:25:17,989
signal the background noise become

2163
01:25:16,250 --> 01:25:19,760
signal and you start to become aware of

2164
01:25:17,989 --> 01:25:22,070
your own internal psychological process

2165
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:24,530
is it something like that he has visions

2166
01:25:22,070 --> 01:25:26,270
and sings in his sleep in some instances

2167
01:25:24,530 --> 01:25:28,099
this period of incubation is marked by

2168
01:25:26,270 --> 01:25:30,409
quite serious symptoms among the accout

2169
01:25:28,099 --> 01:25:32,449
young man sometimes has fits of fury and

2170
01:25:30,409 --> 01:25:34,940
easily loses consciousness hides in the

2171
01:25:32,449 --> 01:25:37,130
forest feeds on the bark of trees throws

2172
01:25:34,940 --> 01:25:41,659
himself into water and fire and cuts

2173
01:25:37,130 --> 01:25:44,210
themselves with knives we went to a part

2174
01:25:41,659 --> 01:25:46,219
lash in northern northern Vancouver

2175
01:25:44,210 --> 01:25:47,090
Island about a year ago and they had

2176
01:25:46,219 --> 01:25:50,000
this one dance

2177
01:25:47,090 --> 01:25:51,650
it was the croc Wakulla natives and they

2178
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:54,320
had this interesting dance that was the

2179
01:25:51,650 --> 01:25:55,969
dance of the wild man and so the person

2180
01:25:54,320 --> 01:25:58,730
who invited us was the wild man and he

2181
01:25:55,969 --> 01:26:00,619
was dressed up and in tree branches and

2182
01:25:58,730 --> 01:26:01,040
so forth and so he was the person who'd

2183
01:26:00,619 --> 01:26:03,470
been in

2184
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:06,140
Bush too long and he came in as a

2185
01:26:03,470 --> 01:26:07,880
cannibal and there there was genuine

2186
01:26:06,140 --> 01:26:10,730
cannibalistic rights among these people

2187
01:26:07,880 --> 01:26:11,990
not so long ago he came in as a cannibal

2188
01:26:10,730 --> 01:26:13,940
and everybody had to wear this like

2189
01:26:11,990 --> 01:26:15,830
cedar headdress because if you had a

2190
01:26:13,940 --> 01:26:17,390
cedar headdress on then the cannibal

2191
01:26:15,830 --> 01:26:19,430
wouldn't take a bite out of you and they

2192
01:26:17,390 --> 01:26:21,680
actually took this rather seriously so

2193
01:26:19,430 --> 01:26:23,540
you should have your cedar headdress on

2194
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:25,040
and so he's looking around the crowd and

2195
01:26:23,540 --> 01:26:27,470
there's like 400 people in this place

2196
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:29,360
and he could really act - so he's doing

2197
01:26:27,470 --> 01:26:32,270
this wild man dance and then all the

2198
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:35,120
women stood up and started to kind of

2199
01:26:32,270 --> 01:26:37,700
dance in place and sing and they were

2200
01:26:35,120 --> 01:26:39,500
taming him so that was really cool you

2201
01:26:37,700 --> 01:26:40,700
know it was really interesting to see

2202
01:26:39,500 --> 01:26:42,380
that because those people are about

2203
01:26:40,700 --> 01:26:44,600
they've had an unbroken culture for

2204
01:26:42,380 --> 01:26:47,390
about 13,000 years say that's how long

2205
01:26:44,600 --> 01:26:49,520
they've been out there and it was very

2206
01:26:47,390 --> 01:26:52,130
interesting to see that dramatization of

2207
01:26:49,520 --> 01:26:55,040
the domestication of of man by women

2208
01:26:52,130 --> 01:26:57,200
laid out in that dance in that way but

2209
01:26:55,040 --> 01:26:58,910
it was also interesting in relationship

2210
01:26:57,200 --> 01:27:00,560
to the shamanic tradition because he

2211
01:26:58,910 --> 01:27:03,830
came in as a wild man right and he had

2212
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:07,790
to be re civilized in some sense and

2213
01:27:03,830 --> 01:27:09,200
brought back down to earth so but by

2214
01:27:07,790 --> 01:27:11,120
whatever method he may have been

2215
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:13,400
designated as shaman is recognized as

2216
01:27:11,120 --> 01:27:15,260
such only after having received two

2217
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:18,470
methods of instruction the first is

2218
01:27:15,260 --> 01:27:20,960
ecstatic dreams trances visions the

2219
01:27:18,470 --> 01:27:24,470
other thing that this guy told me and I

2220
01:27:20,960 --> 01:27:27,200
have no reason to doubt him he's also

2221
01:27:24,470 --> 01:27:29,870
not a literate person and so has a great

2222
01:27:27,200 --> 01:27:31,400
memory he does carving traditional

2223
01:27:29,870 --> 01:27:33,290
carving and he's very good at it he

2224
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:35,600
carved a 53-foot totem pole that's now

2225
01:27:33,290 --> 01:27:38,450
in front of the Museum of Art in

2226
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:40,490
downtown Montreal so if you ever go

2227
01:27:38,450 --> 01:27:44,120
there you can go see it I won't be there

2228
01:27:40,490 --> 01:27:45,800
forever but it's there right now and he

2229
01:27:44,120 --> 01:27:49,490
was taught to carve by his grandparents

2230
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:51,050
and he said that he dreamed in you know

2231
01:27:49,490 --> 01:27:53,150
you know what the Haida images look like

2232
01:27:51,050 --> 01:27:54,950
so the Crocker walks are kind of like

2233
01:27:53,150 --> 01:27:56,780
the high that same sort of imagery he

2234
01:27:54,950 --> 01:27:59,660
told me that he dreamed in those images

2235
01:27:56,780 --> 01:28:02,630
so when he dreams that's the form that

2236
01:27:59,660 --> 01:28:04,160
the things he dreams about takes and he

2237
01:28:02,630 --> 01:28:05,720
also said that he would talk to his

2238
01:28:04,160 --> 01:28:07,220
grandparents in his dream so if he was

2239
01:28:05,720 --> 01:28:09,440
working on a piece of wood and trying to

2240
01:28:07,220 --> 01:28:11,240
figure out how to carve it and he ran

2241
01:28:09,440 --> 01:28:12,500
into a particularly difficult problem

2242
01:28:11,240 --> 01:28:14,030
he'd dream and his great he'd have a

2243
01:28:12,500 --> 01:28:14,780
conversation with his grandparents and

2244
01:28:14,030 --> 01:28:16,159
they'd help him figure

2245
01:28:14,780 --> 01:28:18,110
to solve the problem and then he wake up

2246
01:28:16,159 --> 01:28:20,179
and he could go Karva and the thing is

2247
01:28:18,110 --> 01:28:21,139
he told me these things sort of

2248
01:28:20,179 --> 01:28:22,789
matter-of-factly

2249
01:28:21,139 --> 01:28:25,730
right like you don't you know what I

2250
01:28:22,789 --> 01:28:27,469
mean it wasn't like he was telling me

2251
01:28:25,730 --> 01:28:28,639
these weird things that happened to him

2252
01:28:27,469 --> 01:28:32,030
although he was doing that to some

2253
01:28:28,639 --> 01:28:34,010
degree he I asked him a lot of questions

2254
01:28:32,030 --> 01:28:36,679
about what he carved and what it all

2255
01:28:34,010 --> 01:28:38,780
meant and you know that was just part of

2256
01:28:36,679 --> 01:28:40,820
his explanation of how he did it and he

2257
01:28:38,780 --> 01:28:43,579
he carved me a couple of doors that I

2258
01:28:40,820 --> 01:28:45,739
have in my house and one of them is

2259
01:28:43,579 --> 01:28:49,489
quite interesting well the to make a

2260
01:28:45,739 --> 01:28:50,900
panel and they're an underwater scene

2261
01:28:49,489 --> 01:28:53,659
and under the water there's a bunch of

2262
01:28:50,900 --> 01:28:55,340
you know mythical monsters some of them

2263
01:28:53,659 --> 01:28:57,170
are killer whales and I think there's an

2264
01:28:55,340 --> 01:28:59,510
octopus down there and carved in this

2265
01:28:57,170 --> 01:29:00,619
particular style and he said that the

2266
01:28:59,510 --> 01:29:02,300
other thing that happens to him when he

2267
01:29:00,619 --> 01:29:04,400
dreams is he goes down to the bottom of

2268
01:29:02,300 --> 01:29:06,230
the water where these mythical creatures

2269
01:29:04,400 --> 01:29:08,510
are and he gets inspiration from them

2270
01:29:06,230 --> 01:29:09,559
and so I thought that was extremely

2271
01:29:08,510 --> 01:29:12,230
interesting too

2272
01:29:09,559 --> 01:29:15,099
you know we we don't know what a mind

2273
01:29:12,230 --> 01:29:17,960
that isn't hyper civilized let's say

2274
01:29:15,099 --> 01:29:19,789
hyper literate like like our minds are

2275
01:29:17,960 --> 01:29:22,309
cuz we're so bombarded by external

2276
01:29:19,789 --> 01:29:25,190
stimuli we have no idea what the natural

2277
01:29:22,309 --> 01:29:28,550
mind is like really and so it was quite

2278
01:29:25,190 --> 01:29:30,320
interesting to to to listen to that and

2279
01:29:28,550 --> 01:29:32,110
also to see the consequences cuz he's

2280
01:29:30,320 --> 01:29:35,869
quite a great he's quite a great carver

2281
01:29:32,110 --> 01:29:37,369
so the first is ecstatic dreams trances

2282
01:29:35,869 --> 01:29:39,590
visions the second is traditional

2283
01:29:37,369 --> 01:29:41,900
shamanic techniques names and functions

2284
01:29:39,590 --> 01:29:44,059
of the spirits mythology and genealogy

2285
01:29:41,900 --> 01:29:46,099
of the clan a secret language this

2286
01:29:44,059 --> 01:29:47,750
twofold teaching imparted by the spirits

2287
01:29:46,099 --> 01:29:50,539
and the old master shamans constitutes

2288
01:29:47,750 --> 01:29:51,949
initiation well so you know modern

2289
01:29:50,539 --> 01:29:53,599
people have a problem with that because

2290
01:29:51,949 --> 01:30:01,070
we don't really get initiated but I

2291
01:29:53,599 --> 01:30:03,590
would say that you know let's say that

2292
01:30:01,070 --> 01:30:05,329
we reach out a quest of some sort you

2293
01:30:03,590 --> 01:30:06,860
wouldn't be here I don't think if you

2294
01:30:05,329 --> 01:30:10,219
weren't because why else would you be

2295
01:30:06,860 --> 01:30:13,070
here and so you're on a quest of some

2296
01:30:10,219 --> 01:30:16,460
sort to figure out to struggle with the

2297
01:30:13,070 --> 01:30:18,050
meaning of life let's say and you don't

2298
01:30:16,460 --> 01:30:19,730
want to do that alone because you only

2299
01:30:18,050 --> 01:30:21,469
last like 70 years and good luck

2300
01:30:19,730 --> 01:30:22,699
figuring it out on your on your own it's

2301
01:30:21,469 --> 01:30:25,039
just not gonna happen it's too

2302
01:30:22,699 --> 01:30:27,949
complicated and you'll be too isolated

2303
01:30:25,039 --> 01:30:30,170
right if it's just you that's insanity

2304
01:30:27,949 --> 01:30:31,670
that's no one can stand that and so you

2305
01:30:30,170 --> 01:30:33,380
hope that other people have things to

2306
01:30:31,670 --> 01:30:34,789
tell you and that your culture has

2307
01:30:33,380 --> 01:30:36,769
something to tell you you know so you're

2308
01:30:34,789 --> 01:30:39,860
on a quest maybe not with the same

2309
01:30:36,769 --> 01:30:41,659
intensity as a shamanic initiate but you

2310
01:30:39,860 --> 01:30:44,539
know let's give you some credit and then

2311
01:30:41,659 --> 01:30:47,119
you're also trying to understand the

2312
01:30:44,539 --> 01:30:48,590
wisdom of the past and that's the second

2313
01:30:47,119 --> 01:30:49,969
part of this it's like okay well you're

2314
01:30:48,590 --> 01:30:51,380
a human being and human beings have been

2315
01:30:49,969 --> 01:30:53,000
telling stories for a long period of

2316
01:30:51,380 --> 01:30:54,590
time trying to figure out what's going

2317
01:30:53,000 --> 01:30:56,480
on trying to figure out how to orient

2318
01:30:54,590 --> 01:30:58,550
themselves in the world and so you know

2319
01:30:56,480 --> 01:31:00,349
partly what you're doing here is exactly

2320
01:30:58,550 --> 01:31:02,289
what the shamanic initiatives in the

2321
01:31:00,349 --> 01:31:04,849
second part of the process which is to

2322
01:31:02,289 --> 01:31:08,139
expose yourself to the degree that you

2323
01:31:04,849 --> 01:31:10,730
can - names and functions of the spirits

2324
01:31:08,139 --> 01:31:13,219
mythology and genealogy of the clan and

2325
01:31:10,730 --> 01:31:15,530
the secret language this twofold

2326
01:31:13,219 --> 01:31:17,119
teaching imparted by the spirits and the

2327
01:31:15,530 --> 01:31:20,179
old master shamans constitutes

2328
01:31:17,119 --> 01:31:22,460
initiation so it's that's the rebirth

2329
01:31:20,179 --> 01:31:26,119
right yeah that's that's what a nation

2330
01:31:22,460 --> 01:31:28,039
is it's being born again and and that's

2331
01:31:26,119 --> 01:31:29,690
a birth of the spirit rather than over

2332
01:31:28,039 --> 01:31:31,880
the body it's something like that and so

2333
01:31:29,690 --> 01:31:33,320
it's the rebirth of an integrated psyche

2334
01:31:31,880 --> 01:31:36,440
that's one way of thinking about it and

2335
01:31:33,320 --> 01:31:39,320
a psyche that's that's individual but

2336
01:31:36,440 --> 01:31:41,780
also grounded in common humanity and the

2337
01:31:39,320 --> 01:31:43,699
wisdom of common humanity and that makes

2338
01:31:41,780 --> 01:31:45,769
you strong or at least it makes you

2339
01:31:43,699 --> 01:31:48,139
stronger because there's a limit to your

2340
01:31:45,769 --> 01:31:49,519
strength but God Only Knows to some

2341
01:31:48,139 --> 01:31:51,429
degree what that limit is you know

2342
01:31:49,519 --> 01:31:54,619
people can be unbelievably tough

2343
01:31:51,429 --> 01:31:56,510
unbelievably tough and I think it's even

2344
01:31:54,619 --> 01:31:58,940
the more admirable for human beings to

2345
01:31:56,510 --> 01:32:00,860
be tough because we're so conscious of

2346
01:31:58,940 --> 01:32:03,500
how we can be hurt and we're so

2347
01:32:00,860 --> 01:32:05,630
conscious of what that hurt can lead to

2348
01:32:03,500 --> 01:32:07,519
you know you can have your family taken

2349
01:32:05,630 --> 01:32:09,289
away from you and you can be destroyed

2350
01:32:07,519 --> 01:32:11,210
and the fact that you can be courageous

2351
01:32:09,289 --> 01:32:13,730
in the face of that at all is something

2352
01:32:11,210 --> 01:32:15,559
that is absolutely unbelievable right

2353
01:32:13,730 --> 01:32:17,570
and people deserve a lot more credit I

2354
01:32:15,559 --> 01:32:20,389
think then people give themselves

2355
01:32:17,570 --> 01:32:23,269
because the fact that we can be

2356
01:32:20,389 --> 01:32:26,239
honorable under conditions of life and

2357
01:32:23,269 --> 01:32:28,389
death right of suffering that's that's a

2358
01:32:26,239 --> 01:32:33,199
testament to the human spirit and

2359
01:32:28,389 --> 01:32:34,789
there's a profound anti human ethos I

2360
01:32:33,199 --> 01:32:37,130
think that pervades our culture you know

2361
01:32:34,789 --> 01:32:38,929
that considers human beings cancers on

2362
01:32:37,130 --> 01:32:40,730
the planet something like that you know

2363
01:32:38,929 --> 01:32:41,230
and that there should be less of us it's

2364
01:32:40,730 --> 01:32:43,390
the same

2365
01:32:41,230 --> 01:32:46,030
spirit that motivated the guy who wrote

2366
01:32:43,390 --> 01:32:47,980
the book about it better to have never

2367
01:32:46,030 --> 01:32:50,410
been it's like I don't see it that way

2368
01:32:47,980 --> 01:32:53,440
you know I mean I think people do pretty

2369
01:32:50,410 --> 01:32:54,910
well for you know for having their leg

2370
01:32:53,440 --> 01:32:56,290
caught in a bear trap and their head

2371
01:32:54,910 --> 01:32:58,540
caught in a vise they're actually doing

2372
01:32:56,290 --> 01:33:00,220
pretty well because life is really hard

2373
01:32:58,540 --> 01:33:02,350
and the fact that we're not absolutely

2374
01:33:00,220 --> 01:33:05,170
brutal and murderous all the time is

2375
01:33:02,350 --> 01:33:06,790
really something remarkable given what

2376
01:33:05,170 --> 01:33:08,860
we actually have to contend with that we

2377
01:33:06,790 --> 01:33:11,770
can go out of our way to be honest and

2378
01:33:08,860 --> 01:33:13,810
generous and altruistic and to care for

2379
01:33:11,770 --> 01:33:16,270
each other under unbelievably dire

2380
01:33:13,810 --> 01:33:18,880
circumstances and to act nobly sometimes

2381
01:33:16,270 --> 01:33:20,620
under the most trying conditions you

2382
01:33:18,880 --> 01:33:23,320
know in Solzhenitsyn's Gulag Archipelago

2383
01:33:20,620 --> 01:33:25,750
he tells story after story of people who

2384
01:33:23,320 --> 01:33:28,380
acted abysmally but also people who

2385
01:33:25,750 --> 01:33:30,940
under the worst threats imaginable never

2386
01:33:28,380 --> 01:33:35,320
sacrificed their character you know in

2387
01:33:30,940 --> 01:33:37,150
reading about that is really well it

2388
01:33:35,320 --> 01:33:39,790
really makes you wonder that's that's

2389
01:33:37,150 --> 01:33:41,950
what it does the future shamans among

2390
01:33:39,790 --> 01:33:43,660
the Tungus as they approach maturity go

2391
01:33:41,950 --> 01:33:45,280
through a hysterical or a history would

2392
01:33:43,660 --> 01:33:47,410
crisis but sometimes their vocation

2393
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:48,700
manifests itself at an earlier age the

2394
01:33:47,410 --> 01:33:50,590
boy runs away into the mountains and

2395
01:33:48,700 --> 01:33:52,330
remains there for a week or more feeding

2396
01:33:50,590 --> 01:33:55,420
on animals which he tears to pieces with

2397
01:33:52,330 --> 01:33:57,760
his teeth he returns to the village

2398
01:33:55,420 --> 01:33:59,260
filthy blood-stained and it's only after

2399
01:33:57,760 --> 01:34:02,620
10 or more days that have passed that he

2400
01:33:59,260 --> 01:34:04,450
begins to babble incoherent words the

2401
01:34:02,620 --> 01:34:06,070
strange behavior of future shamans has

2402
01:34:04,450 --> 01:34:07,870
not failed to attract the attention of

2403
01:34:06,070 --> 01:34:09,310
scholars and from the middle of the past

2404
01:34:07,870 --> 01:34:11,350
century several attempts have been made

2405
01:34:09,310 --> 01:34:13,270
to explain the phenomena as a mental

2406
01:34:11,350 --> 01:34:15,670
disorder but the problem was wrongly put

2407
01:34:13,270 --> 01:34:17,730
from the one hand it is not true that

2408
01:34:15,670 --> 01:34:21,940
shamans always are always have to be

2409
01:34:17,730 --> 01:34:23,350
neuropathic in mentally deranged on the

2410
01:34:21,940 --> 01:34:25,330
other hand and this is the critical

2411
01:34:23,350 --> 01:34:26,980
issue those among them who had been ill

2412
01:34:25,330 --> 01:34:29,530
become shamans precisely because they

2413
01:34:26,980 --> 01:34:31,480
had succeeded in becoming cured so it

2414
01:34:29,530 --> 01:34:34,630
was it's not the descent into this

2415
01:34:31,480 --> 01:34:38,050
strange subterranean psychological state

2416
01:34:34,630 --> 01:34:40,000
that constitutes the transformation that

2417
01:34:38,050 --> 01:34:41,380
makes the shaman but it's the emergence

2418
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:43,360
back out of it and that's a journey to

2419
01:34:41,380 --> 01:34:45,970
the underworld in a and a rebirth right

2420
01:34:43,360 --> 01:34:48,250
and so and there's this great book this

2421
01:34:45,970 --> 01:34:51,150
is a great book by a guy named Henry

2422
01:34:48,250 --> 01:34:53,050
Ellen birch a and he was an existential

2423
01:34:51,150 --> 01:34:54,530
psychoanalyst and philosopher and he

2424
01:34:53,050 --> 01:34:56,210
wrote a book called the Discoverer

2425
01:34:54,530 --> 01:34:57,710
of the unconscious which I would highly

2426
01:34:56,210 --> 01:34:59,930
recommend it's on my list of recommended

2427
01:34:57,710 --> 01:35:02,300
readings it is a great book if you want

2428
01:34:59,930 --> 01:35:05,330
to know about the psychoanalytic

2429
01:35:02,300 --> 01:35:08,870
tradition it's the best introduction

2430
01:35:05,330 --> 01:35:10,520
there is and he discusses Adler and Jung

2431
01:35:08,870 --> 01:35:12,740
and Freud and there's a very credible

2432
01:35:10,520 --> 01:35:14,420
job of all three but also takes the

2433
01:35:12,740 --> 01:35:16,220
history of psychoanalytic thought back

2434
01:35:14,420 --> 01:35:19,070
three or four hundred years before Freud

2435
01:35:16,220 --> 01:35:22,280
and so it's it's very engaging reading

2436
01:35:19,070 --> 01:35:23,900
and and and and very interesting and one

2437
01:35:22,280 --> 01:35:27,410
of the things alan burridge a points out

2438
01:35:23,900 --> 01:35:28,670
quite clearly is and he associates this

2439
01:35:27,410 --> 01:35:30,920
to some degree with this shamanic

2440
01:35:28,670 --> 01:35:33,110
tradition that both Freud and Jung Jung

2441
01:35:30,920 --> 01:35:35,870
in particular underwent very intense

2442
01:35:33,110 --> 01:35:37,820
periods of psychological disturbance

2443
01:35:35,870 --> 01:35:39,560
let's say and I would say what was

2444
01:35:37,820 --> 01:35:42,290
happening is that because they were

2445
01:35:39,560 --> 01:35:44,330
questioning their axioms at the most

2446
01:35:42,290 --> 01:35:45,650
fundamental level they were deranging

2447
01:35:44,330 --> 01:35:47,870
their cognitive and perceptual

2448
01:35:45,650 --> 01:35:49,490
structures right and Jung was also

2449
01:35:47,870 --> 01:35:51,170
experimenting with imaginative

2450
01:35:49,490 --> 01:35:53,570
techniques with visionary techniques

2451
01:35:51,170 --> 01:35:55,660
which he which he did a lot and there is

2452
01:35:53,570 --> 01:35:58,460
a period of his life where he was having

2453
01:35:55,660 --> 01:35:59,960
constant a constant stream of visions

2454
01:35:58,460 --> 01:36:02,360
which he wrote down in a book called the

2455
01:35:59,960 --> 01:36:04,190
red book but at the same time he was

2456
01:36:02,360 --> 01:36:06,680
still functioning as a psychiatrist and

2457
01:36:04,190 --> 01:36:09,110
operating normally in the world and so

2458
01:36:06,680 --> 01:36:10,760
you know people have suggested that what

2459
01:36:09,110 --> 01:36:12,800
he had was a psychotic break but that's

2460
01:36:10,760 --> 01:36:14,630
ridiculous because you don't know that's

2461
01:36:12,800 --> 01:36:16,100
not how it works man if you're having a

2462
01:36:14,630 --> 01:36:18,170
psychotic break you you know I've been

2463
01:36:16,100 --> 01:36:19,910
an effective psychiatrist those things

2464
01:36:18,170 --> 01:36:22,280
do not go together especially not for a

2465
01:36:19,910 --> 01:36:25,340
long period of time and so there there's

2466
01:36:22,280 --> 01:36:29,440
the possibility of extreme experience

2467
01:36:25,340 --> 01:36:32,870
without psycho psychopathology and so

2468
01:36:29,440 --> 01:36:34,610
and Allen Burgess he says much the same

2469
01:36:32,870 --> 01:36:36,770
thing about Freud and about Charles

2470
01:36:34,610 --> 01:36:42,320
Darwin as well who underwent a terrible

2471
01:36:36,770 --> 01:36:44,630
period of of mental confusion I would

2472
01:36:42,320 --> 01:36:46,130
say as a consequence of formulating his

2473
01:36:44,630 --> 01:36:47,900
theory of evolution which was really

2474
01:36:46,130 --> 01:36:50,240
hard on him because he was a he was a

2475
01:36:47,900 --> 01:36:52,430
die-hard Christian and he knew what he

2476
01:36:50,240 --> 01:36:53,840
knew what the implications of his theory

2477
01:36:52,430 --> 01:36:55,970
word he didn't know what to do about

2478
01:36:53,840 --> 01:36:57,710
that you know so it was very very hard

2479
01:36:55,970 --> 01:37:00,230
on him so it's quite common for people

2480
01:36:57,710 --> 01:37:03,740
of genius to go through an intense

2481
01:37:00,230 --> 01:37:05,690
crisis psychological crisis but then

2482
01:37:03,740 --> 01:37:06,740
resolve it and the genius is in the

2483
01:37:05,690 --> 01:37:07,000
resolution right

2484
01:37:06,740 --> 01:37:08,560
the

2485
01:37:07,000 --> 01:37:10,480
precondition for the genius is the

2486
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:12,160
dissolution in some sense because you

2487
01:37:10,480 --> 01:37:14,200
have to be obsessed with the problem it

2488
01:37:12,160 --> 01:37:15,580
has to grip you completely before you're

2489
01:37:14,200 --> 01:37:16,960
going to concentrate it on it's so

2490
01:37:15,580 --> 01:37:18,910
obsessively that you might come up with

2491
01:37:16,960 --> 01:37:22,060
a solution but it's the people who come

2492
01:37:18,910 --> 01:37:23,980
up with a solution that are the prophets

2493
01:37:22,060 --> 01:37:26,380
in the shaman and so forth and so on and

2494
01:37:23,980 --> 01:37:28,000
and and so that's not this isn't

2495
01:37:26,380 --> 01:37:29,380
something that only characterizes

2496
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:32,410
archaic cultures we just don't recognize

2497
01:37:29,380 --> 01:37:36,660
it in our own culture properly and and

2498
01:37:32,410 --> 01:37:39,370
that's a problem well sometimes we do

2499
01:37:36,660 --> 01:37:41,350
right you remember that in the Lion King

2500
01:37:39,370 --> 01:37:46,000
right that Rafiki shows up he's the

2501
01:37:41,350 --> 01:37:47,860
shaman he brings he brings Simba down

2502
01:37:46,000 --> 01:37:49,840
that tunnel dark tunnel that's the dark

2503
01:37:47,860 --> 01:37:52,090
night of the soul he has him reflect

2504
01:37:49,840 --> 01:37:53,470
upon himself in a pool when he reflects

2505
01:37:52,090 --> 01:37:55,210
upon himself deeply he sees the

2506
01:37:53,470 --> 01:37:56,830
reflection of his father then that

2507
01:37:55,210 --> 01:37:59,260
becomes a car thing of cosmic

2508
01:37:56,830 --> 01:38:02,470
significance and his father appears in

2509
01:37:59,260 --> 01:38:04,630
the sky just like God appears to jacob

2510
01:38:02,470 --> 01:38:06,430
and basically tells them that it's time

2511
01:38:04,630 --> 01:38:09,010
for him to grow the hell up and to

2512
01:38:06,430 --> 01:38:12,580
return to the devastated kingdom and to

2513
01:38:09,010 --> 01:38:14,230
set it right you know and so and that's

2514
01:38:12,580 --> 01:38:16,000
right that's exactly right I mean we

2515
01:38:14,230 --> 01:38:17,950
live in the devastated Kingdom that's an

2516
01:38:16,000 --> 01:38:19,870
eternal truth and it's the

2517
01:38:17,950 --> 01:38:23,020
responsibility of the individual to grow

2518
01:38:19,870 --> 01:38:25,150
the hell up and to set it right because

2519
01:38:23,020 --> 01:38:27,130
when it's devastated and when things are

2520
01:38:25,150 --> 01:38:29,230
not in place then everyone suffers too

2521
01:38:27,130 --> 01:38:30,940
much and that's not good

2522
01:38:29,230 --> 01:38:32,260
and there's no excuse for not doing

2523
01:38:30,940 --> 01:38:36,250
something about it because you don't

2524
01:38:32,260 --> 01:38:40,120
have anything better to do so and even

2525
01:38:36,250 --> 01:38:42,780
like children's movies tell you this so

2526
01:38:40,120 --> 01:38:46,150
[Music]

2527
01:38:42,780 --> 01:38:48,760
this is a fun one this is from the Eid

2528
01:38:46,150 --> 01:38:52,150
wine Psalter 9th to 12th century and

2529
01:38:48,760 --> 01:38:54,460
that's Adam and Eve but the there is

2530
01:38:52,150 --> 01:38:56,560
speculation that the fruit that they're

2531
01:38:54,460 --> 01:38:59,500
eating there you see it is psilocybin

2532
01:38:56,560 --> 01:39:02,500
mushrooms right because they're the only

2533
01:38:59,500 --> 01:39:03,460
kind of mushroom that grow like that so

2534
01:39:02,500 --> 01:39:07,570
that's pretty wild

2535
01:39:03,460 --> 01:39:09,790
you might say and then this is the I

2536
01:39:07,570 --> 01:39:10,930
think it's called Bannister realign if I

2537
01:39:09,790 --> 01:39:12,640
remember correctly and it's what

2538
01:39:10,930 --> 01:39:15,160
ayahuasca is made out of and it has this

2539
01:39:12,640 --> 01:39:17,320
double helix form which is very very

2540
01:39:15,160 --> 01:39:18,700
interesting and they the people the

2541
01:39:17,320 --> 01:39:20,890
natives nobody could figure out how the

2542
01:39:18,700 --> 01:39:23,440
hell they made this ayahuasca we

2543
01:39:20,890 --> 01:39:25,240
which transports people spiritually in a

2544
01:39:23,440 --> 01:39:27,400
very intense manner and there's a whole

2545
01:39:25,240 --> 01:39:29,200
religion based on it like a modern

2546
01:39:27,400 --> 01:39:31,570
religion as well as the archaic religion

2547
01:39:29,200 --> 01:39:33,430
and to make this stuff they had to take

2548
01:39:31,570 --> 01:39:35,290
two plants that don't grow anywhere near

2549
01:39:33,430 --> 01:39:37,570
each other and like there's like a

2550
01:39:35,290 --> 01:39:39,490
million plants in the Amazon so like how

2551
01:39:37,570 --> 01:39:41,020
do you figure that out nobody knows and

2552
01:39:39,490 --> 01:39:43,180
then you have to cook them in this very

2553
01:39:41,020 --> 01:39:45,790
particular way for a particular amount

2554
01:39:43,180 --> 01:39:47,770
of time before you produce this stuff so

2555
01:39:45,790 --> 01:39:49,540
one of the plants has DMT in it which is

2556
01:39:47,770 --> 01:39:52,690
a very intense psychedelic but it's very

2557
01:39:49,540 --> 01:39:55,030
short acting and the other has an MAO

2558
01:39:52,690 --> 01:39:57,610
inhibitor so if you take the DMT and you

2559
01:39:55,030 --> 01:39:59,650
take the MAO inhibitor then the DMT trip

2560
01:39:57,610 --> 01:40:01,600
lasts for much longer and so that's what

2561
01:39:59,650 --> 01:40:03,310
these Amazonian natives figured out and

2562
01:40:01,600 --> 01:40:05,290
no one has any idea how they managed it

2563
01:40:03,310 --> 01:40:07,120
and if you ask them they tell you that

2564
01:40:05,290 --> 01:40:09,100
the plants told them how to do it which

2565
01:40:07,120 --> 01:40:11,200
isn't much of an explanation as far as

2566
01:40:09,100 --> 01:40:12,910
modern people are concerned but then

2567
01:40:11,200 --> 01:40:16,360
when modern people take the ayahuasca

2568
01:40:12,910 --> 01:40:18,400
and the plant so to speak starts to talk

2569
01:40:16,360 --> 01:40:19,840
to them there are a little less leery of

2570
01:40:18,400 --> 01:40:22,120
the whole theory that the plants had

2571
01:40:19,840 --> 01:40:24,970
something to do with this so you know

2572
01:40:22,120 --> 01:40:26,680
and these things that these I'm loathe

2573
01:40:24,970 --> 01:40:29,110
to talk about this because I'm not an

2574
01:40:26,680 --> 01:40:31,150
advocate for drug use but by the same

2575
01:40:29,110 --> 01:40:34,390
token you can't ignore empirical data

2576
01:40:31,150 --> 01:40:36,340
it's not reasonable and the empirical

2577
01:40:34,390 --> 01:40:38,110
data that psychedelic substances can

2578
01:40:36,340 --> 01:40:39,790
produce mystical experiences and that

2579
01:40:38,110 --> 01:40:41,680
those often have a transformative effect

2580
01:40:39,790 --> 01:40:43,660
I mean one of the latest studies showed

2581
01:40:41,680 --> 01:40:45,820
that if you took people who are dying of

2582
01:40:43,660 --> 01:40:47,890
cancer and you and you gave them

2583
01:40:45,820 --> 01:40:49,630
psilocybin in a sufficient dose to

2584
01:40:47,890 --> 01:40:51,820
produce a mystical experience that you

2585
01:40:49,630 --> 01:40:55,690
radically it decreased their their fear

2586
01:40:51,820 --> 01:40:58,750
of death it's like you go to think about

2587
01:40:55,690 --> 01:41:00,790
that man that's that's tough that's a

2588
01:40:58,750 --> 01:41:02,590
tough experiment you you just wouldn't

2589
01:41:00,790 --> 01:41:05,380
expect that that you think you take

2590
01:41:02,590 --> 01:41:07,150
someone you'd arranged them intensely

2591
01:41:05,380 --> 01:41:08,680
and then when they come back they're not

2592
01:41:07,150 --> 01:41:10,810
even though they're dying they're not

2593
01:41:08,680 --> 01:41:12,700
nearly as afraid of dying you know you

2594
01:41:10,810 --> 01:41:14,170
got to kind of wake up and smell the

2595
01:41:12,700 --> 01:41:15,340
roses when you see something like that

2596
01:41:14,170 --> 01:41:18,840
and the people who are doing this

2597
01:41:15,340 --> 01:41:21,970
research are very reliable people so

2598
01:41:18,840 --> 01:41:23,680
there's the Amanita muscaria you know

2599
01:41:21,970 --> 01:41:24,040
there's this old idea it's quite a funny

2600
01:41:23,680 --> 01:41:26,860
idea

2601
01:41:24,040 --> 01:41:29,830
toadstools so flies like Amanita

2602
01:41:26,860 --> 01:41:31,870
muscaria and there's some this is

2603
01:41:29,830 --> 01:41:34,269
ridiculous there's some evidence that

2604
01:41:31,870 --> 01:41:36,340
they actually like getting stoned

2605
01:41:34,269 --> 01:41:37,960
so cuz animals will eat these like

2606
01:41:36,340 --> 01:41:39,699
reindeer will eat these things too and

2607
01:41:37,960 --> 01:41:42,039
they get pretty tripped out by them and

2608
01:41:39,699 --> 01:41:44,499
so I have this book on psychedelic use

2609
01:41:42,039 --> 01:41:49,090
among animals which is a small book but

2610
01:41:44,499 --> 01:41:51,519
and so so there's there's this idea that

2611
01:41:49,090 --> 01:41:53,230
toads used to sit around the they have

2612
01:41:51,519 --> 01:41:56,170
any NamUs carry and wait for the stone

2613
01:41:53,230 --> 01:41:58,510
flies to like buzz badly around them and

2614
01:41:56,170 --> 01:42:02,469
then snap them up so that's pretty funny

2615
01:41:58,510 --> 01:42:04,570
I think and so and you know there are

2616
01:42:02,469 --> 01:42:07,329
mushrooms in in the u.s. that are the

2617
01:42:04,570 --> 01:42:09,190
oldest the oldest organisms on the

2618
01:42:07,329 --> 01:42:10,389
planet a there's one mushroom I can't

2619
01:42:09,190 --> 01:42:12,999
remember where it is but it covers

2620
01:42:10,389 --> 01:42:15,070
something like oh god I don't know like

2621
01:42:12,999 --> 01:42:16,960
square hundreds of square miles it's

2622
01:42:15,070 --> 01:42:18,340
like this huge thing because it's all

2623
01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:21,670
underground right and they have these

2624
01:42:18,340 --> 01:42:23,320
very complex networks of my Celia

2625
01:42:21,670 --> 01:42:24,789
they're called and they think the thing

2626
01:42:23,320 --> 01:42:27,369
is like a hundred and fifty thousand

2627
01:42:24,789 --> 01:42:28,960
years old something like that so there's

2628
01:42:27,369 --> 01:42:32,559
plenty of things about the world that we

2629
01:42:28,960 --> 01:42:34,690
don't know that's for sure there's the

2630
01:42:32,559 --> 01:42:36,070
chemical makeup of the classic

2631
01:42:34,690 --> 01:42:37,960
psychedelics you see they all have the

2632
01:42:36,070 --> 01:42:40,059
same fundamental structure this is

2633
01:42:37,960 --> 01:42:41,920
serotonin that's the one of the major

2634
01:42:40,059 --> 01:42:43,510
brain neurotransmitters and so what

2635
01:42:41,920 --> 01:42:47,619
happens with the psychedelics is that

2636
01:42:43,510 --> 01:42:51,539
they they alter the they alter the brain

2637
01:42:47,619 --> 01:42:53,530
function by altering the neuro chemical

2638
01:42:51,539 --> 01:42:54,999
utilization of serotonin

2639
01:42:53,530 --> 01:42:57,760
they changed the manner in which the

2640
01:42:54,999 --> 01:42:59,769
serotonergic systems worked and the

2641
01:42:57,760 --> 01:43:01,690
serotonin system is very basic system

2642
01:42:59,769 --> 01:43:03,429
because when you're an embryo and your

2643
01:43:01,690 --> 01:43:05,650
brain is developing it's the serotonin

2644
01:43:03,429 --> 01:43:07,539
projections that basically orchestrate

2645
01:43:05,650 --> 01:43:09,670
the development of your brain so they're

2646
01:43:07,539 --> 01:43:14,920
and they're very archaic circuits very

2647
01:43:09,670 --> 01:43:16,599
very archaic circuits so and this is the

2648
01:43:14,920 --> 01:43:19,030
paper I think I stole this from

2649
01:43:16,599 --> 01:43:20,590
psilocybin Griffiths who's been doing a

2650
01:43:19,030 --> 01:43:22,360
lot of this research psilocybin can

2651
01:43:20,590 --> 01:43:23,889
occasion mystical type experiences

2652
01:43:22,360 --> 01:43:25,179
having substantial and sustained

2653
01:43:23,889 --> 01:43:26,039
personal meaning and spiritual

2654
01:43:25,179 --> 01:43:31,599
significance

2655
01:43:26,039 --> 01:43:34,119
so why that's a good question right like

2656
01:43:31,599 --> 01:43:35,949
so so here's a question for you it is

2657
01:43:34,119 --> 01:43:40,389
beyond dispute that human beings are

2658
01:43:35,949 --> 01:43:43,119
capable of religious experience why why

2659
01:43:40,389 --> 01:43:44,979
is that exactly and like you can

2660
01:43:43,119 --> 01:43:47,139
associate it with psychosis but that

2661
01:43:44,979 --> 01:43:47,920
doesn't work if the theory doesn't hold

2662
01:43:47,139 --> 01:43:50,739
theory

2663
01:43:47,920 --> 01:43:54,790
hold water it's not the same thing so

2664
01:43:50,739 --> 01:43:56,170
why is it there exactly and it's not an

2665
01:43:54,790 --> 01:43:57,340
easy thing to figure out like I've been

2666
01:43:56,170 --> 01:43:58,900
trying to figure I'm always trying to

2667
01:43:57,340 --> 01:44:00,670
figure out a biological explanation for

2668
01:43:58,900 --> 01:44:02,170
everything right because if you want to

2669
01:44:00,670 --> 01:44:03,880
find something to stand on you want to

2670
01:44:02,170 --> 01:44:05,920
make sure that it can resist a challenge

2671
01:44:03,880 --> 01:44:07,510
and so if I can find an explanation for

2672
01:44:05,920 --> 01:44:09,340
something that's reductionistic and

2673
01:44:07,510 --> 01:44:11,679
materialistic and biological then I'm

2674
01:44:09,340 --> 01:44:14,500
going for that that's a tough one

2675
01:44:11,679 --> 01:44:16,090
consciousness is a tough one the moral

2676
01:44:14,500 --> 01:44:18,190
sense is a tough one they're not easy

2677
01:44:16,090 --> 01:44:25,390
things to crack the Big Bang is a tough

2678
01:44:18,190 --> 01:44:29,890
one so you know I mean a cynic might say

2679
01:44:25,390 --> 01:44:32,320
that maybe sometimes when people are

2680
01:44:29,890 --> 01:44:34,390
close to suicide they'll have a mystical

2681
01:44:32,320 --> 01:44:36,460
experience you know and you maybe you

2682
01:44:34,390 --> 01:44:38,590
say well it's a last-ditch attempt of

2683
01:44:36,460 --> 01:44:40,630
your brain to delude you into thinking

2684
01:44:38,590 --> 01:44:44,230
that your life has some significance you

2685
01:44:40,630 --> 01:44:47,410
know and that's a plausible theory but I

2686
01:44:44,230 --> 01:44:54,060
don't think it counts for the generality

2687
01:44:47,410 --> 01:44:54,060
of the phenomena so so I don't buy it

2688
01:44:56,160 --> 01:45:03,460
what happens in the shamanic experience

2689
01:45:00,760 --> 01:45:06,760
is that the shaman has the experience of

2690
01:45:03,460 --> 01:45:09,910
being reduced to a skeleton first so

2691
01:45:06,760 --> 01:45:11,949
death a deaf experience very realistic

2692
01:45:09,910 --> 01:45:15,280
death experience and then the next thing

2693
01:45:11,949 --> 01:45:16,719
that happens is that he finds himself in

2694
01:45:15,280 --> 01:45:19,090
a place where he's communing with his

2695
01:45:16,719 --> 01:45:22,780
ancestor or the ancestral spirits and

2696
01:45:19,090 --> 01:45:25,150
then after that there's the climbing of

2697
01:45:22,780 --> 01:45:29,110
something like the ladder Jacob's Ladder

2698
01:45:25,150 --> 01:45:32,620
se and an encounter with God for all

2699
01:45:29,110 --> 01:45:38,230
intents and purposes and it's very

2700
01:45:32,620 --> 01:45:40,090
widespread phenomena it's the World Tree

2701
01:45:38,230 --> 01:45:42,850
and I've thought about this a lot trying

2702
01:45:40,090 --> 01:45:44,380
to figure out what this what this

2703
01:45:42,850 --> 01:45:46,630
represents according to a yeah coot

2704
01:45:44,380 --> 01:45:48,940
informant that's in Siberia the spirits

2705
01:45:46,630 --> 01:45:50,770
carry the future shaman to hell and shut

2706
01:45:48,940 --> 01:45:52,900
him in a house for three years here he

2707
01:45:50,770 --> 01:45:54,940
undergoes his initiation the spirits cut

2708
01:45:52,900 --> 01:45:57,040
off his head which they set off to one

2709
01:45:54,940 --> 01:45:58,739
side for the novice must watch his own

2710
01:45:57,040 --> 01:46:01,510
dismemberment with his own eyes

2711
01:45:58,739 --> 01:46:01,929
dissolution to the primary elements in

2712
01:46:01,510 --> 01:46:03,820
some

2713
01:46:01,929 --> 01:46:05,499
and hack his body to bits which are

2714
01:46:03,820 --> 01:46:07,659
later distributed among the spirits of

2715
01:46:05,499 --> 01:46:09,129
various sicknesses it's only on this

2716
01:46:07,659 --> 01:46:11,199
condition that the future shaman will

2717
01:46:09,129 --> 01:46:12,820
obtain the power of healing his bones

2718
01:46:11,199 --> 01:46:15,309
are then covered with new flesh and in

2719
01:46:12,820 --> 01:46:16,209
some case he is also given new blood so

2720
01:46:15,309 --> 01:46:18,159
there's a death and resurrection

2721
01:46:16,209 --> 01:46:24,519
experience that's associated with the

2722
01:46:18,159 --> 01:46:25,989
shamanic ritual we're here in the

2723
01:46:24,519 --> 01:46:27,820
presence of a very ancient religious

2724
01:46:25,989 --> 01:46:30,159
idea which belongs to the hunter culture

2725
01:46:27,820 --> 01:46:31,749
bone symbolizes the final route of

2726
01:46:30,159 --> 01:46:34,659
animal life the mould from which the

2727
01:46:31,749 --> 01:46:36,459
flesh continually rises it is from the

2728
01:46:34,659 --> 01:46:38,199
bone that men and animals are reborn for

2729
01:46:36,459 --> 01:46:40,059
a time they maintain themselves in an

2730
01:46:38,199 --> 01:46:41,829
existence of the flesh then they die and

2731
01:46:40,059 --> 01:46:43,780
their life is reduced to the essence

2732
01:46:41,829 --> 01:46:49,809
concentrated in the skeleton from which

2733
01:46:43,780 --> 01:46:53,849
they will be born again that's a good

2734
01:46:49,809 --> 01:46:53,849
graphic representation of the experience

2735
01:46:54,209 --> 01:46:58,119
that's an old painting by I think it's

2736
01:46:56,590 --> 01:46:59,979
her own amis Bosch if I remember

2737
01:46:58,119 --> 01:47:01,570
correctly and I really like that because

2738
01:46:59,979 --> 01:47:03,189
it's it's reminiscent of the near-death

2739
01:47:01,570 --> 01:47:05,019
experiences that you hear people

2740
01:47:03,189 --> 01:47:08,709
describe and they're quite common as

2741
01:47:05,019 --> 01:47:10,929
well and and I had that very weird

2742
01:47:08,709 --> 01:47:11,709
experience once I don't think I've told

2743
01:47:10,929 --> 01:47:15,099
you this story

2744
01:47:11,709 --> 01:47:16,719
I was I was assessing someone who had

2745
01:47:15,099 --> 01:47:18,489
gone through a car windshield and he was

2746
01:47:16,719 --> 01:47:20,229
very depressed it had happened a long

2747
01:47:18,489 --> 01:47:22,269
time before but he was very depressed

2748
01:47:20,229 --> 01:47:25,209
and the insurance company was basically

2749
01:47:22,269 --> 01:47:26,919
accusing him of malingering because he'd

2750
01:47:25,209 --> 01:47:28,209
been depressed for so long and you know

2751
01:47:26,919 --> 01:47:30,340
he'd sort of healed up and everything

2752
01:47:28,209 --> 01:47:31,869
but if your left hemisphere is damaged

2753
01:47:30,340 --> 01:47:33,429
especially the frontal part of your left

2754
01:47:31,869 --> 01:47:35,139
hemisphere then you can be in a chronic

2755
01:47:33,429 --> 01:47:37,320
state of depression because the left

2756
01:47:35,139 --> 01:47:39,610
hemisphere generally speaking is

2757
01:47:37,320 --> 01:47:40,899
responsible for positive emotion and so

2758
01:47:39,610 --> 01:47:43,360
if it isn't there then it's like

2759
01:47:40,899 --> 01:47:45,309
negative emotion for you and so I

2760
01:47:43,360 --> 01:47:47,979
wouldn't assess him and I was giving him

2761
01:47:45,309 --> 01:47:49,389
this I think it was called the MMPI the

2762
01:47:47,979 --> 01:47:52,860
Minnesota multiphasic personality

2763
01:47:49,389 --> 01:47:55,239
inventory which is a kind of a standard

2764
01:47:52,860 --> 01:47:59,199
path personality test half

2765
01:47:55,239 --> 01:48:00,399
psychopathology test and he was filling

2766
01:47:59,199 --> 01:48:02,800
it out he was a very serious guy

2767
01:48:00,399 --> 01:48:05,530
middle-aged guy nothing about him was

2768
01:48:02,800 --> 01:48:07,360
new agey in the least he was like an

2769
01:48:05,530 --> 01:48:08,590
accountant I think I think in fact he

2770
01:48:07,360 --> 01:48:12,249
was an accountant if I remember

2771
01:48:08,590 --> 01:48:16,160
correctly and there was one question and

2772
01:48:12,249 --> 01:48:18,680
it said my spirit has left my

2773
01:48:16,160 --> 01:48:22,610
I think that's right it's very close and

2774
01:48:18,680 --> 01:48:25,640
he stopped and he asked me well he said

2775
01:48:22,610 --> 01:48:27,890
I'm not sure how to answer this and so I

2776
01:48:25,640 --> 01:48:29,420
said well why and he said well after I

2777
01:48:27,890 --> 01:48:32,030
went through the car windshield I was in

2778
01:48:29,420 --> 01:48:33,920
a coma for three weeks something like

2779
01:48:32,030 --> 01:48:36,920
that and I died I think he said he died

2780
01:48:33,920 --> 01:48:39,380
three times and he said that he could

2781
01:48:36,920 --> 01:48:40,640
remember he couldn't remember anything

2782
01:48:39,380 --> 01:48:41,900
during that period of time and he

2783
01:48:40,640 --> 01:48:43,400
couldn't remember the car accident

2784
01:48:41,900 --> 01:48:45,680
that's retrograde amnesia it's quite

2785
01:48:43,400 --> 01:48:47,360
corn common with head injuries and he

2786
01:48:45,680 --> 01:48:49,130
said that during one of those

2787
01:48:47,360 --> 01:48:51,550
experiences and this is all he

2788
01:48:49,130 --> 01:48:54,860
remembered from the hospital was that he

2789
01:48:51,550 --> 01:48:56,690
came out of his body and went down the

2790
01:48:54,860 --> 01:48:58,550
long tunnel of light you've heard these

2791
01:48:56,690 --> 01:49:00,890
near-death experiences and then saw his

2792
01:48:58,550 --> 01:49:03,350
family members there and saw the

2793
01:49:00,890 --> 01:49:05,450
heavenly light and then realized that it

2794
01:49:03,350 --> 01:49:08,060
wasn't his time and came back to his

2795
01:49:05,450 --> 01:49:10,460
body now what was interesting about this

2796
01:49:08,060 --> 01:49:12,770
guy was that well first of all I didn't

2797
01:49:10,460 --> 01:49:14,710
ask him about this right he basically

2798
01:49:12,770 --> 01:49:20,690
volunteered this story and it was

2799
01:49:14,710 --> 01:49:22,040
instigated by this question and and he

2800
01:49:20,690 --> 01:49:23,840
didn't know that anybody else at any

2801
01:49:22,040 --> 01:49:25,370
ever had an experience like that cuz I

2802
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:27,650
asked him if he'd ever heard anything

2803
01:49:25,370 --> 01:49:29,600
about like that he said no so that was

2804
01:49:27,650 --> 01:49:31,160
interesting but what really was

2805
01:49:29,600 --> 01:49:33,920
interesting is how the hell did he

2806
01:49:31,160 --> 01:49:35,840
remember that right because he had

2807
01:49:33,920 --> 01:49:38,000
amnesia during that entire period of

2808
01:49:35,840 --> 01:49:39,920
time he was in a bloody coma so he

2809
01:49:38,000 --> 01:49:45,080
didn't remember anything they remembered

2810
01:49:39,920 --> 01:49:47,239
that and so well those experiences are

2811
01:49:45,080 --> 01:49:48,739
more common than you think and then

2812
01:49:47,239 --> 01:49:50,180
there's a you know there's a painting of

2813
01:49:48,739 --> 01:49:52,520
one which is quite interesting and

2814
01:49:50,180 --> 01:49:54,290
that's like a tunnel to heaven it's the

2815
01:49:52,520 --> 01:49:55,790
same basic idea it's a little bit more

2816
01:49:54,290 --> 01:49:57,620
suffering going on in this one I think

2817
01:49:55,790 --> 01:49:59,180
but that's pretty much typical of

2818
01:49:57,620 --> 01:50:01,969
Hieronymous Bosch I mean I don't know

2819
01:49:59,180 --> 01:50:04,960
what was up with that guy but he was he

2820
01:50:01,969 --> 01:50:07,130
was one strange character now the

2821
01:50:04,960 --> 01:50:11,210
Scandinavians have this idea that the

2822
01:50:07,130 --> 01:50:13,460
world is a tree and I've been thinking

2823
01:50:11,210 --> 01:50:17,540
about that a lot I think that the tree

2824
01:50:13,460 --> 01:50:20,030
idea tree is something that is grounded

2825
01:50:17,540 --> 01:50:22,130
in in matter let's say and that reaches

2826
01:50:20,030 --> 01:50:23,600
up to heaven in the Scandinavian tree at

2827
01:50:22,130 --> 01:50:25,310
the bottom there's quite a cool idea at

2828
01:50:23,600 --> 01:50:27,590
the bottom of that see this tree is

2829
01:50:25,310 --> 01:50:29,389
constantly being gnawed by snakes you

2830
01:50:27,590 --> 01:50:31,369
can sort of see the snakes at the bottom

2831
01:50:29,389 --> 01:50:33,380
and at the same time it's being watered

2832
01:50:31,369 --> 01:50:35,119
and the water makes the tree grow at the

2833
01:50:33,380 --> 01:50:37,579
same rate that the snakes gnaw on its

2834
01:50:35,119 --> 01:50:39,559
roots so it's like a yin-yang idea you

2835
01:50:37,579 --> 01:50:41,840
know that there's continual chaotic

2836
01:50:39,559 --> 01:50:44,030
destruction and replacement at the basis

2837
01:50:41,840 --> 01:50:45,860
of whatever this process is but the tree

2838
01:50:44,030 --> 01:50:48,800
seems to me to be a representation not

2839
01:50:45,860 --> 01:50:50,869
so much of its it's like a different

2840
01:50:48,800 --> 01:50:53,059
dimensional space that's that's what's

2841
01:50:50,869 --> 01:50:56,090
trying to be represented so imagine that

2842
01:50:53,059 --> 01:50:58,669
you know you're structured if you take

2843
01:50:56,090 --> 01:51:00,530
powers of ten magnification say human

2844
01:50:58,669 --> 01:51:02,869
beings are about in the middle of the

2845
01:51:00,530 --> 01:51:05,689
tiniest thing and the largest thing if

2846
01:51:02,869 --> 01:51:08,329
you do it by my powers of 10 and so you

2847
01:51:05,689 --> 01:51:10,489
know you have a subatomic level in an

2848
01:51:08,329 --> 01:51:14,389
atomic level a molecular level and you

2849
01:51:10,489 --> 01:51:15,800
know then that may be a level of organs

2850
01:51:14,389 --> 01:51:17,840
and then there's you and then there's

2851
01:51:15,800 --> 01:51:21,649
your family and so on all the way up the

2852
01:51:17,840 --> 01:51:23,929
the tree fundamentally and so I think

2853
01:51:21,649 --> 01:51:25,399
that what this tree represents and this

2854
01:51:23,929 --> 01:51:27,590
is the things that thing that the shaman

2855
01:51:25,399 --> 01:51:29,539
moves up and down I think that's what it

2856
01:51:27,590 --> 01:51:32,599
represents it's this it's this different

2857
01:51:29,539 --> 01:51:33,829
view of of its dimensionality it's

2858
01:51:32,599 --> 01:51:35,030
something like that and I think that

2859
01:51:33,829 --> 01:51:36,619
what happens in the psychedelic

2860
01:51:35,030 --> 01:51:38,840
experience is that consciousness can

2861
01:51:36,619 --> 01:51:40,579
travel up and down that structure it's

2862
01:51:38,840 --> 01:51:42,469
something like that and maybe not only

2863
01:51:40,579 --> 01:51:44,899
up and down it but maybe right through

2864
01:51:42,469 --> 01:51:47,539
it and I know that's a radical claim

2865
01:51:44,899 --> 01:51:50,599
it's a really radical claim and it might

2866
01:51:47,539 --> 01:51:52,309
be wrong but it's probably wrong even

2867
01:51:50,599 --> 01:52:03,940
because most radical claims are wrong

2868
01:51:52,309 --> 01:52:07,730
but but but I'm not so sure it's wrong

2869
01:52:03,940 --> 01:52:09,590
and here's something cool so that's the

2870
01:52:07,730 --> 01:52:13,550
Scandinavian world tree and that was

2871
01:52:09,590 --> 01:52:15,200
drawn by an anthropologist who visited

2872
01:52:13,550 --> 01:52:23,660
the tribes in the Amazon who use

2873
01:52:15,200 --> 01:52:25,940
ayahuasca now you see it's a snake it's

2874
01:52:23,660 --> 01:52:28,430
a tree with snakes well you know that's

2875
01:52:25,940 --> 01:52:30,230
reminiscent of the story in Adam and Eve

2876
01:52:28,430 --> 01:52:32,810
obviously but it's also reminiscent of

2877
01:52:30,230 --> 01:52:35,060
our primate dwelling place right because

2878
01:52:32,810 --> 01:52:38,270
that was basically our ancestral home a

2879
01:52:35,060 --> 01:52:40,190
tree surrounded by snakes and the snakes

2880
01:52:38,270 --> 01:52:43,520
like to eat us and this is a long time

2881
01:52:40,190 --> 01:52:47,120
ago this is like 50 million years ago

2882
01:52:43,520 --> 01:52:49,220
it's really a long time ago and so we

2883
01:52:47,120 --> 01:52:52,070
don't know where these images come from

2884
01:52:49,220 --> 01:52:56,750
precisely but I do have the suspicion

2885
01:52:52,070 --> 01:52:59,870
that we use the circuitry that we

2886
01:52:56,750 --> 01:53:02,990
developed to detect snakes to represent

2887
01:52:59,870 --> 01:53:04,130
the unknown as such because like a snake

2888
01:53:02,990 --> 01:53:06,620
is something that comes out of the

2889
01:53:04,130 --> 01:53:08,510
unknown and like we evolved right we all

2890
01:53:06,620 --> 01:53:12,320
evolved out of an animal sub structure

2891
01:53:08,510 --> 01:53:14,480
and so we had to get our our biological

2892
01:53:12,320 --> 01:53:16,370
cognitive structure from somewhere and

2893
01:53:14,480 --> 01:53:18,200
we have this capacity of thinking about

2894
01:53:16,370 --> 01:53:20,210
the absolute unknown and the terrors

2895
01:53:18,200 --> 01:53:21,710
that are involved in that that the

2896
01:53:20,210 --> 01:53:23,630
horrors that can emerge from what we

2897
01:53:21,710 --> 01:53:26,480
don't understand and it stands perfectly

2898
01:53:23,630 --> 01:53:27,950
to reason that we would use circuits

2899
01:53:26,480 --> 01:53:29,630
that were already pre developed for that

2900
01:53:27,950 --> 01:53:31,360
and that this is a reasonable

2901
01:53:29,630 --> 01:53:36,920
representation of the existential

2902
01:53:31,360 --> 01:53:40,040
structure of the world so I think I

2903
01:53:36,920 --> 01:53:42,590
might have showed you this before but it

2904
01:53:40,040 --> 01:53:45,140
never ceases to amaze me this this

2905
01:53:42,590 --> 01:53:47,960
picture so my son drew this when he was

2906
01:53:45,140 --> 01:53:50,990
nine eight and so on the right you see

2907
01:53:47,960 --> 01:53:53,900
mushroom houses and they have the names

2908
01:53:50,990 --> 01:53:56,330
of all his friends on them and so that's

2909
01:53:53,900 --> 01:53:58,670
order right and then on the left side

2910
01:53:56,330 --> 01:54:00,860
you see chaos there and that little

2911
01:53:58,670 --> 01:54:02,300
orange thing is a bug and then there's a

2912
01:54:00,860 --> 01:54:05,000
river that runs right down the middle

2913
01:54:02,300 --> 01:54:07,220
and so that's like the you know the

2914
01:54:05,000 --> 01:54:08,840
yin-yang symbol with the divide in the

2915
01:54:07,220 --> 01:54:10,370
middle that's quite cool and then

2916
01:54:08,840 --> 01:54:10,760
there's there it is there's Jacob's

2917
01:54:10,370 --> 01:54:12,950
Ladder

2918
01:54:10,760 --> 01:54:15,140
it's like Jack and the Beanstalk which

2919
01:54:12,950 --> 01:54:17,050
is by the way another variant of the

2920
01:54:15,140 --> 01:54:18,730
same shamanic story

2921
01:54:17,050 --> 01:54:21,370
and there are bugs going up and down it

2922
01:54:18,730 --> 01:54:24,490
they're taking messages from heaven

2923
01:54:21,370 --> 01:54:26,890
and then up there in heaven it's got the

2924
01:54:24,490 --> 01:54:28,750
Sun and there's st. Peter and I don't

2925
01:54:26,890 --> 01:54:30,070
know where in the world he got this it's

2926
01:54:28,750 --> 01:54:34,750
not like he had a lot of religious

2927
01:54:30,070 --> 01:54:36,190
education I mean despite me and you know

2928
01:54:34,750 --> 01:54:38,290
there's the pearly gates up there and

2929
01:54:36,190 --> 01:54:40,240
then that was the world as far as his he

2930
01:54:38,290 --> 01:54:43,060
had a very well ordered psyche I would

2931
01:54:40,240 --> 01:54:45,070
say and and still does but when he drew

2932
01:54:43,060 --> 01:54:47,320
that it just absolutely blew me away and

2933
01:54:45,070 --> 01:54:50,710
so I had it laminated and it's in my

2934
01:54:47,320 --> 01:54:51,910
office because well I don't know because

2935
01:54:50,710 --> 01:55:07,030
like what the hell do you make of that

2936
01:54:51,910 --> 01:55:08,410
you know that's that's why so well you

2937
01:55:07,030 --> 01:55:10,210
sort of get the picture there you know

2938
01:55:08,410 --> 01:55:14,020
the cathedrals the great cathedrals of

2939
01:55:10,210 --> 01:55:16,090
Europe are there like the forests in

2940
01:55:14,020 --> 01:55:18,640
stone right and they try to represent

2941
01:55:16,090 --> 01:55:20,650
the light coming through the leaves and

2942
01:55:18,640 --> 01:55:22,810
so it's sort of our ancestral forest

2943
01:55:20,650 --> 01:55:25,540
home but it's it's transformed into

2944
01:55:22,810 --> 01:55:27,370
these great sculptures of stone and you

2945
01:55:25,540 --> 01:55:29,380
know they produce all because of the

2946
01:55:27,370 --> 01:55:31,420
combination of light and darkness and

2947
01:55:29,380 --> 01:55:33,850
color but also I think for the same

2948
01:55:31,420 --> 01:55:35,080
reason that huge trees produce awe and

2949
01:55:33,850 --> 01:55:37,300
people you know and we don't want them

2950
01:55:35,080 --> 01:55:42,250
cut down they seem sacred in some sense

2951
01:55:37,300 --> 01:55:45,100
and perhaps they are but you know it

2952
01:55:42,250 --> 01:55:48,280
also seemed to me this is an intuition

2953
01:55:45,100 --> 01:55:50,590
that the the architects of these great

2954
01:55:48,280 --> 01:55:52,240
cathedrals were trying to get they're

2955
01:55:50,590 --> 01:55:54,790
trying to express something that's deep

2956
01:55:52,240 --> 01:55:56,470
and structural they're trying time

2957
01:55:54,790 --> 01:55:59,680
trying to express the idea that if being

2958
01:55:56,470 --> 01:56:01,570
was constituted properly then it would

2959
01:55:59,680 --> 01:56:04,270
be organized from the subatomic level

2960
01:56:01,570 --> 01:56:07,150
all the way up to the highest cosmic

2961
01:56:04,270 --> 01:56:08,550
level perfectly so every layer stacked

2962
01:56:07,150 --> 01:56:10,480
on top of each other without any

2963
01:56:08,550 --> 01:56:12,820
contradictions now that would be an

2964
01:56:10,480 --> 01:56:14,560
ideal mode of being and everything would

2965
01:56:12,820 --> 01:56:17,020
come together under those circumstances

2966
01:56:14,560 --> 01:56:18,490
and that's what's being expressed in

2967
01:56:17,020 --> 01:56:19,780
these cathedrals it's not all that's

2968
01:56:18,490 --> 01:56:21,970
being expressed because they're also

2969
01:56:19,780 --> 01:56:24,070
shaped like a cross and you know the

2970
01:56:21,970 --> 01:56:25,990
idea is that the center of the cross

2971
01:56:24,070 --> 01:56:27,820
which is the center of suffering is also

2972
01:56:25,990 --> 01:56:29,140
the place of the individual the place

2973
01:56:27,820 --> 01:56:30,820
where the transformation takes place

2974
01:56:29,140 --> 01:56:39,190
that's all built into the architect

2975
01:56:30,820 --> 01:56:43,719
as well and so then there's the tree

2976
01:56:39,190 --> 01:56:49,119
like structures that make us up it

2977
01:56:43,719 --> 01:56:58,659
stretched down to the tiniest realities

2978
01:56:49,119 --> 01:57:00,369
the microcosm and there's this this idea

2979
01:56:58,659 --> 01:57:01,900
it's all represented in the same way

2980
01:57:00,369 --> 01:57:04,270
again it's this idea especially the

2981
01:57:01,900 --> 01:57:07,090
Mandela up in the top-right it's the

2982
01:57:04,270 --> 01:57:09,429
idea of is perfection of crystalline

2983
01:57:07,090 --> 01:57:11,079
structure and that's what the Yogi's are

2984
01:57:09,429 --> 01:57:12,639
trying to attain when they organize

2985
01:57:11,079 --> 01:57:15,070
their bodies they're trying to get every

2986
01:57:12,639 --> 01:57:17,409
single layer of their being aligned

2987
01:57:15,070 --> 01:57:19,630
properly and it's something like and you

2988
01:57:17,409 --> 01:57:22,599
can kind of see an echo of that in the I

2989
01:57:19,630 --> 01:57:26,590
think that's a Tibetan sand painting if

2990
01:57:22,599 --> 01:57:28,210
I remember correctly left the idea is

2991
01:57:26,590 --> 01:57:30,610
that if you get yourself a line properly

2992
01:57:28,210 --> 01:57:35,139
then information can flow along that

2993
01:57:30,610 --> 01:57:37,540
tree that that's you without without

2994
01:57:35,139 --> 01:57:39,159
impediment something like that and that

2995
01:57:37,540 --> 01:57:42,760
would be like a state of optimal health

2996
01:57:39,159 --> 01:57:45,340
and that both physical and spiritual

2997
01:57:42,760 --> 01:57:47,500
exercises can put you in that state and

2998
01:57:45,340 --> 01:57:49,030
that's well those are all clouds of

2999
01:57:47,500 --> 01:57:54,820
ideas that surround this idea of a

3000
01:57:49,030 --> 01:57:56,829
ladder to heaven so Jacob is talking to

3001
01:57:54,820 --> 01:57:59,469
God and God says behold I am with thee

3002
01:57:56,829 --> 01:58:01,119
and I will keep thee in all places where

3003
01:57:59,469 --> 01:58:03,159
you go and bring you again into this

3004
01:58:01,119 --> 01:58:04,750
land for I won't leave you until I have

3005
01:58:03,159 --> 01:58:09,040
done that which I have spoken to you of

3006
01:58:04,750 --> 01:58:10,540
and Jacob awakened out of his sleep and

3007
01:58:09,040 --> 01:58:12,340
he said surely the Lord is in this place

3008
01:58:10,540 --> 01:58:15,190
and I knew it not and he was afraid and

3009
01:58:12,340 --> 01:58:16,750
said how dreadful is this place this is

3010
01:58:15,190 --> 01:58:19,989
none other but the house of God and this

3011
01:58:16,750 --> 01:58:21,250
is the gate of heaven when Jacob rose up

3012
01:58:19,989 --> 01:58:22,989
early in the morning and took the stone

3013
01:58:21,250 --> 01:58:25,239
that he had put for his pillows and set

3014
01:58:22,989 --> 01:58:28,449
it up for a pillar and poured oil on top

3015
01:58:25,239 --> 01:58:29,949
of it that's a sacrifice and he called

3016
01:58:28,449 --> 01:58:31,690
the name of that place Bethel but the

3017
01:58:29,949 --> 01:58:34,179
name of the city was called l-'izzat the

3018
01:58:31,690 --> 01:58:36,219
first and Jacob vowed a vow saying if

3019
01:58:34,179 --> 01:58:37,900
God will be with me and will keep me in

3020
01:58:36,219 --> 01:58:40,840
this way that I go and will give me

3021
01:58:37,900 --> 01:58:42,250
bread to eat and raiment to put on so

3022
01:58:40,840 --> 01:58:44,710
that I come again to my father's house

3023
01:58:42,250 --> 01:58:46,480
in peace then shall the Lord be my god

3024
01:58:44,710 --> 01:58:48,640
and this stone which I have set for a

3025
01:58:46,480 --> 01:58:50,770
pillar shall be God's house and of all

3026
01:58:48,640 --> 01:58:54,969
of that that is given to me I will

3027
01:58:50,770 --> 01:58:58,600
surely give the tenth unto thee and

3028
01:58:54,969 --> 01:59:04,960
that's a pretty good place to stop so

3029
01:58:58,600 --> 01:59:07,150
now I'll just conclude so you have this

3030
01:59:04,960 --> 01:59:09,940
very morally ambivalent character right

3031
01:59:07,150 --> 01:59:12,100
who's so far pretty much everything he's

3032
01:59:09,940 --> 01:59:14,830
done that we're familiar with is not

3033
01:59:12,100 --> 01:59:17,110
good so he's he's betrayed his brother

3034
01:59:14,830 --> 01:59:18,850
horribly twice badly enough so that he

3035
01:59:17,110 --> 01:59:21,190
his brother wants to kill him and

3036
01:59:18,850 --> 01:59:23,920
everyone can kind of sympathize with his

3037
01:59:21,190 --> 01:59:26,200
brother so and then he runs away

3038
01:59:23,920 --> 01:59:28,210
essentially because his mother tells him

3039
01:59:26,200 --> 01:59:32,290
to which is not exactly a testament to

3040
01:59:28,210 --> 01:59:35,020
his character and despite that strangely

3041
01:59:32,290 --> 01:59:38,890
enough he has this experience you know

3042
01:59:35,020 --> 01:59:42,880
and that's heartening I guess and that's

3043
01:59:38,890 --> 01:59:45,460
the point is that people are predisposed

3044
01:59:42,880 --> 01:59:50,560
to terrible error there's no doubt about

3045
01:59:45,460 --> 01:59:52,680
that and yet when I was writing my

3046
01:59:50,560 --> 01:59:55,560
latest book I had a friend of mine

3047
01:59:52,680 --> 01:59:57,670
Norman Doidge wrote the foreword and

3048
01:59:55,560 --> 02:00:01,690
Norma's written a couple of great books

3049
01:59:57,670 --> 02:00:03,790
and he's Jewish and he read some of what

3050
02:00:01,690 --> 02:00:06,520
I'd written and he took me to task for

3051
02:00:03,790 --> 02:00:08,230
making the god of the Old Testament you

3052
02:00:06,520 --> 02:00:12,219
know from a Christian perspective too

3053
02:00:08,230 --> 02:00:14,020
harsh and unforgiving and I rewrote a

3054
02:00:12,219 --> 02:00:15,430
fair bit of it because of his criticism

3055
02:00:14,020 --> 02:00:17,260
and because of what I've learned doing

3056
02:00:15,430 --> 02:00:19,660
these lectures it's like it's not

3057
02:00:17,260 --> 02:00:21,250
exactly right you know I mean what

3058
02:00:19,660 --> 02:00:23,440
happens in the Old Testament is if you

3059
02:00:21,250 --> 02:00:25,180
screw up especially if you know you do

3060
02:00:23,440 --> 02:00:26,800
and you decide that you're not going to

3061
02:00:25,180 --> 02:00:29,560
do anything about it so it's conscious

3062
02:00:26,800 --> 02:00:31,390
and deliberate then like look the hell

3063
02:00:29,560 --> 02:00:33,219
out you are in serious trouble and I

3064
02:00:31,390 --> 02:00:34,870
actually think that's also

3065
02:00:33,219 --> 02:00:36,580
psychologically accurate one of the

3066
02:00:34,870 --> 02:00:39,100
things young pointed out and this always

3067
02:00:36,580 --> 02:00:40,450
struck me was that if you don't know

3068
02:00:39,100 --> 02:00:41,950
what you're doing this is actually in

3069
02:00:40,450 --> 02:00:43,570
the Gospel of Thomas as well

3070
02:00:41,950 --> 02:00:45,430
interestingly enough as one of the

3071
02:00:43,570 --> 02:00:47,650
caustic Gospels Christ tells his

3072
02:00:45,430 --> 02:00:48,820
followers something like if you make a

3073
02:00:47,650 --> 02:00:51,430
mistake and you don't know what you're

3074
02:00:48,820 --> 02:00:52,870
doing then you'll be forgiven for it but

3075
02:00:51,430 --> 02:00:55,300
if you make a mistake knowing what

3076
02:00:52,870 --> 02:00:57,599
you're doing and you do it anyways then

3077
02:00:55,300 --> 02:01:00,150
like good luck to you

3078
02:00:57,599 --> 02:01:03,150
and and and I think that's I think

3079
02:01:00,150 --> 02:01:10,139
that's that's psychologically accurate I

3080
02:01:03,150 --> 02:01:12,570
mean one of the things that's very

3081
02:01:10,139 --> 02:01:15,360
interesting about the judgmental God in

3082
02:01:12,570 --> 02:01:17,849
the Old Testament however is that he can

3083
02:01:15,360 --> 02:01:20,190
be bargained with and even if you make

3084
02:01:17,849 --> 02:01:21,510
mistakes especially if you're

3085
02:01:20,190 --> 02:01:25,110
unconscious of them if you haven't

3086
02:01:21,510 --> 02:01:26,790
learned yet let's say then you always

3087
02:01:25,110 --> 02:01:29,310
have the opportunity to return to the

3088
02:01:26,790 --> 02:01:30,480
proper path and that's people get

3089
02:01:29,310 --> 02:01:33,119
cynical about that because there's no

3090
02:01:30,480 --> 02:01:34,770
this mostly Christian idea that you

3091
02:01:33,119 --> 02:01:36,360
could live a terribly sinful life but if

3092
02:01:34,770 --> 02:01:38,040
you repented on your deathbed it's like

3093
02:01:36,360 --> 02:01:40,110
heaven for you and it's like oh that's

3094
02:01:38,040 --> 02:01:41,909
that sounds like a great deal right it's

3095
02:01:40,110 --> 02:01:44,040
like you can do whatever the hell you

3096
02:01:41,909 --> 02:01:45,480
want until just before you die of course

3097
02:01:44,040 --> 02:01:47,429
you might not know when that is so

3098
02:01:45,480 --> 02:01:48,960
that's a problem you then you can just

3099
02:01:47,429 --> 02:01:50,610
say well I'm sorry and you know

3100
02:01:48,960 --> 02:01:51,960
everything's forgiven but the problem

3101
02:01:50,610 --> 02:01:53,820
with being cynical about that sort of

3102
02:01:51,960 --> 02:01:57,210
thing is that it's no trivial matter to

3103
02:01:53,820 --> 02:01:59,880
repent you know because to repent means

3104
02:01:57,210 --> 02:02:02,909
a figure out what you actually did and

3105
02:01:59,880 --> 02:02:05,489
the worst things that you did the more

3106
02:02:02,909 --> 02:02:07,500
horrible it is to figure it out it's no

3107
02:02:05,489 --> 02:02:09,300
joke right and there's no genuine

3108
02:02:07,500 --> 02:02:13,619
repentance without understanding of the

3109
02:02:09,300 --> 02:02:15,540
depth of your depravity and so if you

3110
02:02:13,619 --> 02:02:18,119
lived a particularly reprehensible life

3111
02:02:15,540 --> 02:02:20,790
and you come to understand it I think

3112
02:02:18,119 --> 02:02:23,400
that in and of itself could kill you you

3113
02:02:20,790 --> 02:02:25,949
know it's a terrible thing to wake up

3114
02:02:23,400 --> 02:02:30,090
and see what you've done if what you've

3115
02:02:25,949 --> 02:02:32,310
done is truly terrible so there's no

3116
02:02:30,090 --> 02:02:34,590
easy out it's not an easy out it's it's

3117
02:02:32,310 --> 02:02:37,290
just pure cynicism to associate that

3118
02:02:34,590 --> 02:02:40,590
idea with with an easy oh it's not but

3119
02:02:37,290 --> 02:02:42,389
there is that positive idea that it's

3120
02:02:40,590 --> 02:02:45,599
continually represented is that the

3121
02:02:42,389 --> 02:02:50,790
individual is the source of moral choice

3122
02:02:45,599 --> 02:02:53,369
and the individual is prone to genuine

3123
02:02:50,790 --> 02:02:55,230
error and temptation in a believable and

3124
02:02:53,369 --> 02:02:57,540
realistic way but that that doesn't

3125
02:02:55,230 --> 02:02:59,940
sever the relationship between the

3126
02:02:57,540 --> 02:03:02,099
individual and the divine and the

3127
02:02:59,940 --> 02:03:03,329
possibility of further growth and then I

3128
02:03:02,099 --> 02:03:05,159
would say well thank God for that

3129
02:03:03,329 --> 02:03:07,079
because without that like who would have

3130
02:03:05,159 --> 02:03:11,010
a chance right who would have a chance

3131
02:03:07,079 --> 02:03:13,349
and so the idea that

3132
02:03:11,010 --> 02:03:14,820
the daddy has presented the infinite

3133
02:03:13,349 --> 02:03:16,440
let's say as presented in the Old

3134
02:03:14,820 --> 02:03:18,869
Testament is merely judgmental is

3135
02:03:16,440 --> 02:03:21,119
definitely wrong and and is in fact

3136
02:03:18,869 --> 02:03:23,599
something that you can contend with and

3137
02:03:21,119 --> 02:03:25,739
Argan with oh I'll close with one thing

3138
02:03:23,599 --> 02:03:27,630
one of the things that I learned that

3139
02:03:25,739 --> 02:03:29,280
while I was going through this was the

3140
02:03:27,630 --> 02:03:32,729
meaning of the name Israel because Jacob

3141
02:03:29,280 --> 02:03:34,709
eventually gets named Israel and and I'm

3142
02:03:32,729 --> 02:03:37,530
jumping ahead a little bit to the next

3143
02:03:34,709 --> 02:03:39,179
lecture but Israel and so he's also the

3144
02:03:37,530 --> 02:03:41,429
father of Israel and the father of the

3145
02:03:39,179 --> 02:03:42,300
twelve sons who make up the twelve

3146
02:03:41,429 --> 02:03:44,070
tribes of Israel

3147
02:03:42,300 --> 02:03:47,130
but what Israel means is he who

3148
02:03:44,070 --> 02:03:49,110
struggles with God and that's such an

3149
02:03:47,130 --> 02:03:52,079
interesting idea because it's again a

3150
02:03:49,110 --> 02:03:53,729
psychological idea and that's why I said

3151
02:03:52,079 --> 02:03:55,380
earlier that it isn't obvious in the Old

3152
02:03:53,729 --> 02:03:57,300
Testament what it means to believe in

3153
02:03:55,380 --> 02:03:59,429
God because what Jacob does is struggle

3154
02:03:57,300 --> 02:04:01,550
with God and I think that that's a

3155
02:03:59,429 --> 02:04:04,320
really good characterization of an

3156
02:04:01,550 --> 02:04:05,699
ethical life because if you're trying to

3157
02:04:04,320 --> 02:04:08,579
lead an ethical life that's what you're

3158
02:04:05,699 --> 02:04:10,530
doing is you're struggling like blind

3159
02:04:08,579 --> 02:04:11,999
belief isn't helpful because you don't

3160
02:04:10,530 --> 02:04:14,309
know what you're believing in like it's

3161
02:04:11,999 --> 02:04:17,639
just not that helpful but if you're

3162
02:04:14,309 --> 02:04:19,829
possessed by by the desire to orient

3163
02:04:17,639 --> 02:04:22,050
yourself properly but also confused by

3164
02:04:19,829 --> 02:04:24,449
the by the existential structure of the

3165
02:04:22,050 --> 02:04:25,499
world which we all are then then what

3166
02:04:24,449 --> 02:04:27,239
you're doing when you're trying to

3167
02:04:25,499 --> 02:04:30,809
orient yourself properly in life is

3168
02:04:27,239 --> 02:04:32,219
struggling ethically and Jacob actually

3169
02:04:30,809 --> 02:04:35,999
gets quite hurt he wrestles with God

3170
02:04:32,219 --> 02:04:38,039
literally and God dislocates his his his

3171
02:04:35,999 --> 02:04:40,499
thigh and so you know the idea there is

3172
02:04:38,039 --> 02:04:43,199
watch the hell out right the thing that

3173
02:04:40,499 --> 02:04:45,090
you're contending with is powerful

3174
02:04:43,199 --> 02:04:46,829
although you can contend with it that's

3175
02:04:45,090 --> 02:04:48,749
the thing that's so interesting but you

3176
02:04:46,829 --> 02:04:51,119
know you do it at some genuine peril

3177
02:04:48,749 --> 02:04:53,849
which i think is exactly right but the

3178
02:04:51,119 --> 02:04:55,590
idea that Israel so there's Israel the

3179
02:04:53,849 --> 02:04:56,760
state let's say it Israel the promised

3180
02:04:55,590 --> 02:04:58,590
land and all of that but there's this

3181
02:04:56,760 --> 02:05:00,989
more important idea which is again a

3182
02:04:58,590 --> 02:05:03,269
psychological idea which is the State of

3183
02:05:00,989 --> 02:05:05,579
Israel which is the promised land is the

3184
02:05:03,269 --> 02:05:12,119
state that everyone who wrestles with

3185
02:05:05,579 --> 02:05:16,079
God exists in and that's not happy naive

3186
02:05:12,119 --> 02:05:18,510
belief in you know an eternally blessed

3187
02:05:16,079 --> 02:05:20,760
afterlife it's not that it's not a wish

3188
02:05:18,510 --> 02:05:23,550
fulfillment it's it's it's to be

3189
02:05:20,760 --> 02:05:24,940
actively engaged in life in the

3190
02:05:23,550 --> 02:05:26,860
difficulties of life

3191
02:05:24,940 --> 02:05:29,350
right and trying to find the path

3192
02:05:26,860 --> 02:05:32,080
because that's what wrestling with God

3193
02:05:29,350 --> 02:05:34,290
is is trying to find the path and that

3194
02:05:32,080 --> 02:05:35,950
seems to me what belief means

3195
02:05:34,290 --> 02:05:38,020
fundamentally in the Old Testament

3196
02:05:35,950 --> 02:05:41,290
perhaps in the New Testament as well is

3197
02:05:38,020 --> 02:05:43,960
that belief is expressed in trying to

3198
02:05:41,290 --> 02:05:45,520
find the path and that's an ethical

3199
02:05:43,960 --> 02:05:46,990
struggle and it's a real struggle it's

3200
02:05:45,520 --> 02:05:48,610
the struggle of life so as long as

3201
02:05:46,990 --> 02:05:51,670
you're willing to engage in that

3202
02:05:48,610 --> 02:05:57,040
struggle then hypothetically you have

3203
02:05:51,670 --> 02:06:00,070
the divine behind you and so I believe

3204
02:05:57,040 --> 02:06:02,800
that I think that's true because the

3205
02:06:00,070 --> 02:06:04,330
other thing I see is that the people who

3206
02:06:02,800 --> 02:06:09,130
set things right

3207
02:06:04,330 --> 02:06:11,890
so that yeah the the horrible forces of

3208
02:06:09,130 --> 02:06:13,030
cosmic destruction don't do us in the

3209
02:06:11,890 --> 02:06:14,740
people who are trying to set things

3210
02:06:13,030 --> 02:06:17,830
right are the ones that are struggling

3211
02:06:14,740 --> 02:06:20,140
ethically and so and that there is a

3212
02:06:17,830 --> 02:06:21,520
redemptive element to that and I don't

3213
02:06:20,140 --> 02:06:27,320
think there's any way of being cynical

3214
02:06:21,520 --> 02:06:47,930
about that so well so thank you will

3215
02:06:27,320 --> 02:06:47,930
[Applause]

3216
02:06:50,150 --> 02:06:54,600
so remember to speak right into the mic

3217
02:06:53,040 --> 02:06:57,710
because there are all these other people

3218
02:06:54,600 --> 02:07:00,330
watching that will hear it will hear us

3219
02:06:57,710 --> 02:07:03,420
so okay

3220
02:07:00,330 --> 02:07:04,560
hi dr. Peterson so with the story of

3221
02:07:03,420 --> 02:07:06,240
Jacob today there was a theme of

3222
02:07:04,560 --> 02:07:07,860
betrayal and you can see that from the

3223
02:07:06,240 --> 02:07:08,730
beginning because he was very angry and

3224
02:07:07,860 --> 02:07:11,460
jealous at his brother

3225
02:07:08,730 --> 02:07:13,380
I was thinking are there new stories or

3226
02:07:11,460 --> 02:07:15,450
we can say about betrayal that does come

3227
02:07:13,380 --> 02:07:17,460
from a loved one right where it's not

3228
02:07:15,450 --> 02:07:19,950
from a place of so black and white of

3229
02:07:17,460 --> 02:07:23,700
anger resentment and bitter and how do

3230
02:07:19,950 --> 02:07:25,260
the parties kind of recover from that or

3231
02:07:23,700 --> 02:07:26,910
is there any way to redeem that or is it

3232
02:07:25,260 --> 02:07:29,960
as black and white as if you betray

3233
02:07:26,910 --> 02:07:33,060
someone then there it's like Jacob where

3234
02:07:29,960 --> 02:07:35,610
hatred no and in fact in this story it's

3235
02:07:33,060 --> 02:07:38,880
not black and white because we know

3236
02:07:35,610 --> 02:07:40,680
we're only halfway through it and one of

3237
02:07:38,880 --> 02:07:43,560
the things I've noticed as a clinician

3238
02:07:40,680 --> 02:07:45,810
let's say is that and as an observer of

3239
02:07:43,560 --> 02:07:47,850
people in general is that I've never

3240
02:07:45,810 --> 02:07:50,400
ever seen anyone get away with anything

3241
02:07:47,850 --> 02:07:55,680
and Jacob doesn't get away with any of

3242
02:07:50,400 --> 02:07:58,830
this and so you know he's humbled by his

3243
02:07:55,680 --> 02:08:00,390
eventual experiences and he learns that

3244
02:07:58,830 --> 02:08:02,250
he did it wrong and there's

3245
02:08:00,390 --> 02:08:05,430
reconciliation that happens throughout

3246
02:08:02,250 --> 02:08:07,560
the story of Jacob so and there's minor

3247
02:08:05,430 --> 02:08:09,390
betrayals and major betrayals you know

3248
02:08:07,560 --> 02:08:11,100
that some of them have tremendously

3249
02:08:09,390 --> 02:08:13,530
serious consequences and some of them

3250
02:08:11,100 --> 02:08:15,810
have lesser consequences but there is an

3251
02:08:13,530 --> 02:08:19,740
underlying idea that things can still be

3252
02:08:15,810 --> 02:08:22,230
set right even though it's well I think

3253
02:08:19,740 --> 02:08:22,770
it takes Jacob some 20 years something

3254
02:08:22,230 --> 02:08:25,260
like that

3255
02:08:22,770 --> 02:08:28,890
to set things right and even then it's

3256
02:08:25,260 --> 02:08:34,770
like touch and go so if I answer your

3257
02:08:28,890 --> 02:08:37,410
question okay yeah hey you speak

3258
02:08:34,770 --> 02:08:39,900
frequently in your lectures about I

3259
02:08:37,410 --> 02:08:41,910
guess the war between good and evil or

3260
02:08:39,900 --> 02:08:43,920
the struggle of life really is a

3261
02:08:41,910 --> 02:08:46,530
struggle between good and evil being at

3262
02:08:43,920 --> 02:08:53,540
the core of a conscious lived existence

3263
02:08:46,530 --> 02:08:57,930
and I guess on that note if you were

3264
02:08:53,540 --> 02:08:58,920
100% certain that there was no afterlife

3265
02:08:57,930 --> 02:09:00,480
would you still

3266
02:08:58,920 --> 02:09:03,510
be able to preach that there's a

3267
02:09:00,480 --> 02:09:05,250
positive meaning in life if you were a

3268
02:09:03,510 --> 02:09:07,920
hundred percent certain some atheists

3269
02:09:05,250 --> 02:09:09,360
seem to be 100 percent certain and yet

3270
02:09:07,920 --> 02:09:11,160
they still preach that there's some

3271
02:09:09,360 --> 02:09:13,260
positive meaning to life would you be

3272
02:09:11,160 --> 02:09:17,400
one of those or would you turn into Cain

3273
02:09:13,260 --> 02:09:19,860
you know so cynical I think that well as

3274
02:09:17,400 --> 02:09:22,020
far as I'm concerned one of the things I

3275
02:09:19,860 --> 02:09:24,390
learned from studying 20th century

3276
02:09:22,020 --> 02:09:26,640
history is that like even if the idea

3277
02:09:24,390 --> 02:09:29,239
that even if you take the most cynical

3278
02:09:26,640 --> 02:09:31,500
of ideas let's say that life is

3279
02:09:29,239 --> 02:09:35,219
irredeemable suffering and and perhaps

3280
02:09:31,500 --> 02:09:38,100
isn't even justified because of that it

3281
02:09:35,219 --> 02:09:41,940
still seems to me that you have an

3282
02:09:38,100 --> 02:09:43,650
ethical duty let's say to live in a

3283
02:09:41,940 --> 02:09:47,580
manner that reduces that to the degree

3284
02:09:43,650 --> 02:09:49,290
part that that's possible and so and I

3285
02:09:47,580 --> 02:09:51,510
think that that can be experienced as

3286
02:09:49,290 --> 02:09:53,880
meaningful in some sense independently

3287
02:09:51,510 --> 02:09:55,830
of the transcendent context now I don't

3288
02:09:53,880 --> 02:09:58,199
exactly know how to strip off the

3289
02:09:55,830 --> 02:09:59,640
transcendent context because one of the

3290
02:09:58,199 --> 02:10:01,199
things I would say that's happened to me

3291
02:09:59,640 --> 02:10:02,880
is because I've spent so much time

3292
02:10:01,199 --> 02:10:05,250
looking at the horrible things that

3293
02:10:02,880 --> 02:10:07,469
people have done is that it's like Jung

3294
02:10:05,250 --> 02:10:10,410
said that he when this is one of his

3295
02:10:07,469 --> 02:10:12,270
famous quotes he said no tree can reach

3296
02:10:10,410 --> 02:10:15,480
up to heaven unless its roots reach down

3297
02:10:12,270 --> 02:10:19,949
to hell and so as I've dug deeper into

3298
02:10:15,480 --> 02:10:21,780
the depravity of human beings my sense

3299
02:10:19,949 --> 02:10:25,830
of the possibility of human beings has

3300
02:10:21,780 --> 02:10:28,679
also grown what would you say in

3301
02:10:25,830 --> 02:10:30,480
proportion and until I've become

3302
02:10:28,679 --> 02:10:32,489
convinced actually that good is a more

3303
02:10:30,480 --> 02:10:34,469
powerful force than evil even though

3304
02:10:32,489 --> 02:10:36,719
evil is an unbelievably powerful force

3305
02:10:34,469 --> 02:10:38,460
and so I can't really strip the

3306
02:10:36,719 --> 02:10:40,620
transcendent away now whether what

3307
02:10:38,460 --> 02:10:44,730
bearing that has on eternity say on an

3308
02:10:40,620 --> 02:10:46,620
afterlife i mean i i i I can't say

3309
02:10:44,730 --> 02:10:48,660
anything about that the only thing I

3310
02:10:46,620 --> 02:10:50,370
guess I can say is that there are many

3311
02:10:48,660 --> 02:10:53,310
things about being that we don't

3312
02:10:50,370 --> 02:10:54,900
understand in the least and we don't

3313
02:10:53,310 --> 02:10:58,560
understand the nature of consciousness

3314
02:10:54,900 --> 02:11:00,719
or the nature of time so I I'm not I

3315
02:10:58,560 --> 02:11:02,429
wouldn't despair about that but yes I

3316
02:11:00,719 --> 02:11:05,400
think that life can still be meaningful

3317
02:11:02,429 --> 02:11:08,600
without without there being a necessity

3318
02:11:05,400 --> 02:11:08,600
of an afterlife

3319
02:11:10,370 --> 02:11:21,330
no no no no hi dr. Pederson

3320
02:11:19,140 --> 02:11:23,730
so since studying your work one of the

3321
02:11:21,330 --> 02:11:26,130
things that I found most fascinating is

3322
02:11:23,730 --> 02:11:33,179
your analysis of the story of Cain and

3323
02:11:26,130 --> 02:11:37,340
Abel and my question is if if Cain got

3324
02:11:33,179 --> 02:11:39,929
to the point that he did right before

3325
02:11:37,340 --> 02:11:42,870
killing his brother murdering his ideal

3326
02:11:39,929 --> 02:11:45,540
and decided that that was something he

3327
02:11:42,870 --> 02:11:47,489
didn't want to do what advice or

3328
02:11:45,540 --> 02:11:51,080
guidance would you would you give a

3329
02:11:47,489 --> 02:11:51,080
person that got to that point

3330
02:11:52,640 --> 02:12:01,530
well there's a story I read called the

3331
02:11:59,179 --> 02:12:04,230
cocktail party I've mentioned this

3332
02:12:01,530 --> 02:12:06,660
before by TS Eliot and in the cocktail

3333
02:12:04,230 --> 02:12:09,000
party there's a scene it's a play where

3334
02:12:06,660 --> 02:12:10,830
this woman approaches a psychiatrist and

3335
02:12:09,000 --> 02:12:13,290
and starts talking to him about her

3336
02:12:10,830 --> 02:12:15,870
problems and she says something that

3337
02:12:13,290 --> 02:12:18,179
surprises him she says I hope that I'm

3338
02:12:15,870 --> 02:12:20,070
the problem he says well why would you

3339
02:12:18,179 --> 02:12:22,380
hope that and she says well I thought

3340
02:12:20,070 --> 02:12:24,449
about it a lot and if the world is the

3341
02:12:22,380 --> 02:12:26,460
problem then I'm done because I can't

3342
02:12:24,449 --> 02:12:27,620
change the world but if I'm the problem

3343
02:12:26,460 --> 02:12:30,929
then maybe there's something about

3344
02:12:27,620 --> 02:12:33,690
myself I can change and I can undo this

3345
02:12:30,929 --> 02:12:35,330
terrible situation that I'm in and so I

3346
02:12:33,690 --> 02:12:39,390
would say that's repentance

3347
02:12:35,330 --> 02:12:41,429
fundamentally it's like there if and I

3348
02:12:39,390 --> 02:12:45,360
say this carefully because I understand

3349
02:12:41,429 --> 02:12:50,610
that people are susceptible to bad

3350
02:12:45,360 --> 02:12:52,590
fortune sin and ignorance can make that

3351
02:12:50,610 --> 02:12:55,410
worse but independently of that like

3352
02:12:52,590 --> 02:12:55,949
good people suffer make no mistake about

3353
02:12:55,410 --> 02:13:01,020
it

3354
02:12:55,949 --> 02:13:04,920
but if things aren't right for you if

3355
02:13:01,020 --> 02:13:06,900
you're resentful about being because

3356
02:13:04,920 --> 02:13:08,489
that's the right way of because that's

3357
02:13:06,900 --> 02:13:10,350
the deepest way of thinking about if you

3358
02:13:08,489 --> 02:13:12,239
read the writings of the people who do

3359
02:13:10,350 --> 02:13:13,860
the mass killings for example that's

3360
02:13:12,239 --> 02:13:16,530
what you see over and over it's cain

3361
02:13:13,860 --> 02:13:19,830
it's like they're angry beyond

3362
02:13:16,530 --> 02:13:22,440
comprehension at the in tolerability of

3363
02:13:19,830 --> 02:13:23,640
being and they're angry at God

3364
02:13:22,440 --> 02:13:25,800
even if they don't say it exactly like

3365
02:13:23,640 --> 02:13:27,449
that they come so close to saying it

3366
02:13:25,800 --> 02:13:31,199
like that that it's there's no

3367
02:13:27,449 --> 02:13:33,300
difference you know what God says to

3368
02:13:31,199 --> 02:13:38,130
Cain is look to yourself first before

3369
02:13:33,300 --> 02:13:41,550
you criticize being and that strikes me

3370
02:13:38,130 --> 02:13:43,530
as right it's because to not do that is

3371
02:13:41,550 --> 02:13:45,840
arrogant beyond belief that's satanic

3372
02:13:43,530 --> 02:13:48,300
arrogance literally if something like

3373
02:13:45,840 --> 02:13:50,250
that can be literal it's like don't make

3374
02:13:48,300 --> 02:13:56,060
yourself the judge of being before you

3375
02:13:50,250 --> 02:13:58,410
clean up your your room let's say and

3376
02:13:56,060 --> 02:13:59,910
because the other thing to it this is

3377
02:13:58,410 --> 02:14:01,620
something I learned in some part from

3378
02:13:59,910 --> 02:14:03,239
Solzhenitsyn when he was in the prison

3379
02:14:01,620 --> 02:14:05,190
camps and trying to understand how these

3380
02:14:03,239 --> 02:14:07,350
heroic people he saw could possibly

3381
02:14:05,190 --> 02:14:08,880
manage it one of the exercises he

3382
02:14:07,350 --> 02:14:11,219
undertook and he really viewed this

3383
02:14:08,880 --> 02:14:13,980
within a Christian Orthodox context of

3384
02:14:11,219 --> 02:14:15,420
repentance and redemption is he said he

3385
02:14:13,980 --> 02:14:19,890
went over his life with a fine-tooth

3386
02:14:15,420 --> 02:14:22,230
comb and tried to imagine all of the

3387
02:14:19,890 --> 02:14:25,469
ethical mistakes he made in his entire

3388
02:14:22,230 --> 02:14:28,440
life that he knew were mistakes it was

3389
02:14:25,469 --> 02:14:30,239
it was this was the soul searched not he

3390
02:14:28,440 --> 02:14:32,160
wasn't relying on external standards of

3391
02:14:30,239 --> 02:14:34,380
morality except insofar as we're

3392
02:14:32,160 --> 02:14:36,480
inevitably influenced by those and then

3393
02:14:34,380 --> 02:14:39,530
his idea was is there something I could

3394
02:14:36,480 --> 02:14:41,969
do right now to put that right and

3395
02:14:39,530 --> 02:14:44,699
that's the right question like if things

3396
02:14:41,969 --> 02:14:46,680
aren't going your way and I think that

3397
02:14:44,699 --> 02:14:48,780
means that you're resentful and arrogant

3398
02:14:46,680 --> 02:14:50,540
and deceitful those are the three things

3399
02:14:48,780 --> 02:14:52,590
that clump together I think that

3400
02:14:50,540 --> 02:14:54,150
constitute the core of evil it's

3401
02:14:52,590 --> 02:14:58,080
something like that and so if you're

3402
02:14:54,150 --> 02:15:00,750
possessed by that which is a hell then

3403
02:14:58,080 --> 02:15:02,640
its repentance that's the right answer

3404
02:15:00,750 --> 02:15:04,590
and what that means is you have to

3405
02:15:02,640 --> 02:15:07,140
figure out what you did wrong and you

3406
02:15:04,590 --> 02:15:08,790
have to pay for it and then at least you

3407
02:15:07,140 --> 02:15:11,760
could think well look I can try that

3408
02:15:08,790 --> 02:15:14,460
with all of my soul let's say and see

3409
02:15:11,760 --> 02:15:15,960
what happens right it can at least be an

3410
02:15:14,460 --> 02:15:17,850
experiment and then I would also say

3411
02:15:15,960 --> 02:15:19,890
that that's an act of faith it's an act

3412
02:15:17,850 --> 02:15:21,390
of faith to conduct that experiment

3413
02:15:19,890 --> 02:15:23,190
because you put yourself on the line

3414
02:15:21,390 --> 02:15:24,989
right and that's what an active faith is

3415
02:15:23,190 --> 02:15:27,270
you don't know the outcome but you don't

3416
02:15:24,989 --> 02:15:29,250
know the outcome of your life so live in

3417
02:15:27,270 --> 02:15:31,170
some sense is an act of faith you're

3418
02:15:29,250 --> 02:15:32,730
putting faith in something that that's

3419
02:15:31,170 --> 02:15:34,770
why you're moving forward you couldn't

3420
02:15:32,730 --> 02:15:36,810
move forward without an act of faith you

3421
02:15:34,770 --> 02:15:38,790
know and people say well I own

3422
02:15:36,810 --> 02:15:40,710
move forward on the basis of the facts

3423
02:15:38,790 --> 02:15:42,360
it's like yeah but you select the facts

3424
02:15:40,710 --> 02:15:43,770
and there's an infinity of facts and

3425
02:15:42,360 --> 02:15:47,250
they don't just tell you what to do so

3426
02:15:43,770 --> 02:15:51,090
it's not a credible answer so if you're

3427
02:15:47,250 --> 02:15:53,760
in that situation it's like look to

3428
02:15:51,090 --> 02:15:55,140
yourself you know and one of the things

3429
02:15:53,760 --> 02:15:57,120
about Solzhenitsyn that's so bloody

3430
02:15:55,140 --> 02:15:59,010
amazing is that's what he did and then

3431
02:15:57,120 --> 02:16:01,080
he wrote the Gulag Archipelago and you

3432
02:15:59,010 --> 02:16:03,740
know he took an axe to the intellectual

3433
02:16:01,080 --> 02:16:06,930
and moral substructure of of the

3434
02:16:03,740 --> 02:16:09,690
totalitarian communist states so while

3435
02:16:06,930 --> 02:16:11,220
he was redeeming himself let's say he

3436
02:16:09,690 --> 02:16:14,100
was simultaneously redeeming the world

3437
02:16:11,220 --> 02:16:16,290
and you know you see something like that

3438
02:16:14,100 --> 02:16:29,160
like you you gotta wake up man that's

3439
02:16:16,290 --> 02:16:30,600
that was really something so yeah dr.

3440
02:16:29,160 --> 02:16:32,760
Peterson I have a lot of questions that

3441
02:16:30,600 --> 02:16:34,860
arise from your comments at the Bell for

3442
02:16:32,760 --> 02:16:36,179
one hundred event your m103 video your

3443
02:16:34,860 --> 02:16:38,219
recent discussion with ayaan Hirsi Ali

3444
02:16:36,179 --> 02:16:40,710
and your comments on Islam in the West

3445
02:16:38,219 --> 02:16:42,090
in general and in your comments there's

3446
02:16:40,710 --> 02:16:43,980
this common theme that one of these

3447
02:16:42,090 --> 02:16:45,990
things is not like the other you put the

3448
02:16:43,980 --> 02:16:48,450
judeo-christian tradition on the one

3449
02:16:45,990 --> 02:16:50,490
side and Islam on the other specifically

3450
02:16:48,450 --> 02:16:52,620
the quote complex problem of Islam in

3451
02:16:50,490 --> 02:16:54,660
the quote as a quote totalizing system

3452
02:16:52,620 --> 02:16:57,270
and before I go further let me state

3453
02:16:54,660 --> 02:16:58,650
that if hypothetically a final analysis

3454
02:16:57,270 --> 02:17:00,540
of Islam resulted in as total of

3455
02:16:58,650 --> 02:17:02,250
denunciation as your analysis of

3456
02:17:00,540 --> 02:17:03,719
post-modernism or near Marxism I

3457
02:17:02,250 --> 02:17:06,840
wouldn't be personally offended at all

3458
02:17:03,719 --> 02:17:08,340
this isn't a a personal question in your

3459
02:17:06,840 --> 02:17:10,920
recent interview with ayaan Hirsi Ali

3460
02:17:08,340 --> 02:17:13,620
she said Western values are superior to

3461
02:17:10,920 --> 02:17:13,980
Islamic law and Islamic values I agree

3462
02:17:13,620 --> 02:17:15,719
with that

3463
02:17:13,980 --> 02:17:17,610
basically certainly in the context of

3464
02:17:15,719 --> 02:17:18,810
let's say current global affairs I'll

3465
02:17:17,610 --> 02:17:20,190
skip the quotes from a recent magazine

3466
02:17:18,810 --> 02:17:22,110
interview but you should read them

3467
02:17:20,190 --> 02:17:24,719
because hers is a worldview which is

3468
02:17:22,110 --> 02:17:26,550
very much the West versus Islam not

3469
02:17:24,719 --> 02:17:29,190
radical Islam but Islam including

3470
02:17:26,550 --> 02:17:30,179
necessarily the military option so my

3471
02:17:29,190 --> 02:17:31,590
question is at the level of

3472
02:17:30,179 --> 02:17:33,150
psychological significance of these

3473
02:17:31,590 --> 02:17:35,280
stories at the level of mythology and

3474
02:17:33,150 --> 02:17:37,139
archetype how is Islam so different from

3475
02:17:35,280 --> 02:17:39,719
the Jo Christian tradition you know

3476
02:17:37,139 --> 02:17:41,400
because Adam Adam Eve of Shaitaan

3477
02:17:39,719 --> 02:17:44,160
Shaitaan so on and so forth everything

3478
02:17:41,400 --> 02:17:45,240
from the fault of the flood a lot of

3479
02:17:44,160 --> 02:17:46,830
what you've discussed in this lecture

3480
02:17:45,240 --> 02:17:48,810
series is necessarily part of Islam as

3481
02:17:46,830 --> 02:17:50,020
well and in fact I think one of the

3482
02:17:48,810 --> 02:17:52,570
strongest criticism of Islam

3483
02:17:50,020 --> 02:17:54,940
that it's perhaps pretty unoriginal you

3484
02:17:52,570 --> 02:17:56,290
know tonight you said that the moral

3485
02:17:54,940 --> 02:17:58,870
presuppositions of a culture are

3486
02:17:56,290 --> 02:18:00,640
instantiated in its stories I see a lot

3487
02:17:58,870 --> 02:18:02,140
of the same stories so current global

3488
02:18:00,640 --> 02:18:04,150
affairs aside I'm asking at the deepest

3489
02:18:02,140 --> 02:18:07,180
levels how different are these stories

3490
02:18:04,150 --> 02:18:12,790
in the morals presuppositions ok well

3491
02:18:07,180 --> 02:18:14,850
that's that's a killer question well ok

3492
02:18:12,790 --> 02:18:18,461
so the first thing I would say is

3493
02:18:14,850 --> 02:18:20,440
fundamentally I don't know and so part

3494
02:18:18,461 --> 02:18:22,091
of the reason that I'm one of the things

3495
02:18:20,440 --> 02:18:24,310
I'm planning to do is to have a series

3496
02:18:22,091 --> 02:18:27,280
of discussions and plenty of people have

3497
02:18:24,310 --> 02:18:30,490
contacted me about discussing with ayaan

3498
02:18:27,280 --> 02:18:35,860
Hirsi Ali as you know she has powerful

3499
02:18:30,490 --> 02:18:39,150
and serious folks and they're not happy

3500
02:18:35,860 --> 02:18:43,120
with her black and white distinction and

3501
02:18:39,150 --> 02:18:45,820
so now I read infidel and I really liked

3502
02:18:43,120 --> 02:18:49,570
that book like I my sense was that she

3503
02:18:45,820 --> 02:18:51,310
she was a heroine now what that means in

3504
02:18:49,570 --> 02:18:55,650
relationship to Islam that's a different

3505
02:18:51,310 --> 02:18:58,660
story because she came out of a like a

3506
02:18:55,650 --> 02:19:01,841
totalitarian let's say family structure

3507
02:18:58,660 --> 02:19:04,660
in a relatively totalitarian society and

3508
02:19:01,841 --> 02:19:06,190
you could make the case that there's a

3509
02:19:04,660 --> 02:19:07,540
correspondence between that and his

3510
02:19:06,190 --> 02:19:09,190
lemon you could make the case that there

3511
02:19:07,540 --> 02:19:13,720
isn't and and of course that's the

3512
02:19:09,190 --> 02:19:15,310
critical issue and so there's a couple

3513
02:19:13,720 --> 02:19:18,010
of things that I can't wrap my head

3514
02:19:15,310 --> 02:19:21,430
around with we have wrap my head around

3515
02:19:18,010 --> 02:19:24,730
easily in relationship to Islam and so

3516
02:19:21,430 --> 02:19:27,780
one is what I see as the failure to

3517
02:19:24,730 --> 02:19:32,320
separate church from state and that's a

3518
02:19:27,780 --> 02:19:34,540
problem now it may not be a problem as

3519
02:19:32,320 --> 02:19:36,131
such but it's certainly a problem in

3520
02:19:34,540 --> 02:19:38,320
relationship to the relation between

3521
02:19:36,131 --> 02:19:39,461
Islam and the West because we separate

3522
02:19:38,320 --> 02:19:41,801
church from state

3523
02:19:39,461 --> 02:19:43,510
now there's fundamentalists in the

3524
02:19:41,801 --> 02:19:45,190
United States Christian fundamentalists

3525
02:19:43,510 --> 02:19:50,200
who think that that separation is a

3526
02:19:45,190 --> 02:19:51,910
mistake so it's not only it's not only

3527
02:19:50,200 --> 02:19:54,311
an idea that's rooted in Islam that

3528
02:19:51,910 --> 02:19:56,141
those should be United but it's

3529
02:19:54,311 --> 02:19:57,580
definitely a problem with regards to our

3530
02:19:56,141 --> 02:20:00,160
coexistence because that's a

3531
02:19:57,580 --> 02:20:03,160
fundamentally different presumption okay

3532
02:20:00,160 --> 02:20:03,910
so that's problem number one problem

3533
02:20:03,160 --> 02:20:05,800
number two

3534
02:20:03,910 --> 02:20:07,540
for me and again this may be a

3535
02:20:05,800 --> 02:20:11,550
consequence of my ignorance which I'm

3536
02:20:07,540 --> 02:20:15,220
trying to rectify Muhammad was a warlord

3537
02:20:11,550 --> 02:20:18,190
and I I don't know what to do about that

3538
02:20:15,220 --> 02:20:22,601
fact like one thing you can say about

3539
02:20:18,190 --> 02:20:24,811
Christ hypothetically let's say I'm not

3540
02:20:22,601 --> 02:20:27,280
talking about a historical reality

3541
02:20:24,811 --> 02:20:30,370
necessarily although I'm not denying it

3542
02:20:27,280 --> 02:20:33,220
either is that of all the things he was

3543
02:20:30,370 --> 02:20:36,311
warlord was definitely not one of them

3544
02:20:33,220 --> 02:20:40,930
and I don't know what to do about that

3545
02:20:36,311 --> 02:20:43,710
and so I don't know how to reconcile

3546
02:20:40,930 --> 02:20:47,320
that and I don't know how to reconcile

3547
02:20:43,710 --> 02:20:49,630
like not only was Muhammad a warlord

3548
02:20:47,320 --> 02:20:55,960
which I don't think is an unreasonable

3549
02:20:49,630 --> 02:21:00,610
thing to proclaim the expansion that he

3550
02:20:55,960 --> 02:21:02,920
initiated was unbelievably successful I

3551
02:21:00,610 --> 02:21:04,180
mean within six hundred years it was the

3552
02:21:02,920 --> 02:21:06,760
biggest empire of the world had ever

3553
02:21:04,180 --> 02:21:08,710
seen and a demolished Byzantine

3554
02:21:06,760 --> 02:21:11,440
Christianity which is something that

3555
02:21:08,710 --> 02:21:13,061
Western people don't even know you know

3556
02:21:11,440 --> 02:21:16,210
I've read thinkers who said that the

3557
02:21:13,061 --> 02:21:18,010
West was so traumatized culturally let's

3558
02:21:16,210 --> 02:21:20,771
say by the demolition of Byzantine

3559
02:21:18,010 --> 02:21:24,311
Christianity that we can't even study it

3560
02:21:20,771 --> 02:21:26,500
now and so I don't know if that's true

3561
02:21:24,311 --> 02:21:27,040
but I don't know that it's not true

3562
02:21:26,500 --> 02:21:30,070
either

3563
02:21:27,040 --> 02:21:33,580
and the Buddhists were wiped out of

3564
02:21:30,070 --> 02:21:35,680
Afghanistan and we saw that echoed in

3565
02:21:33,580 --> 02:21:41,230
talibans destruction of those great

3566
02:21:35,680 --> 02:21:46,750
Buddhist monuments and so so what I'm

3567
02:21:41,230 --> 02:21:49,840
hoping is that there's a bridge there

3568
02:21:46,750 --> 02:21:51,220
better be a bridge and that's why I want

3569
02:21:49,840 --> 02:21:53,351
to have these discussions because I'd

3570
02:21:51,220 --> 02:21:56,050
like to understand if there's a bridge

3571
02:21:53,351 --> 02:21:58,180
and so lots of people have sent me

3572
02:21:56,050 --> 02:22:00,580
people who I should talk to who who they

3573
02:21:58,180 --> 02:22:02,980
think represent Islam far better than

3574
02:22:00,580 --> 02:22:04,750
ayaan Hirsi Ali and perhaps they're

3575
02:22:02,980 --> 02:22:06,851
correct and hopefully I'll get an

3576
02:22:04,750 --> 02:22:08,771
opportunity to talk to them because I

3577
02:22:06,851 --> 02:22:12,130
would like to know why I would like to

3578
02:22:08,771 --> 02:22:13,750
know if what I think is wrong because if

3579
02:22:12,130 --> 02:22:16,060
it's wrong it's important that I know

3580
02:22:13,750 --> 02:22:19,180
it's wrong but

3581
02:22:16,060 --> 02:22:27,550
at the moment I don't a I don't know

3582
02:22:19,180 --> 02:22:31,660
it's wrong and B I don't see I'm not

3583
02:22:27,550 --> 02:22:33,730
sure what it signifies so and I don't

3584
02:22:31,660 --> 02:22:37,840
think anyone is sure right because we

3585
02:22:33,730 --> 02:22:39,970
have this entangled entangling of the

3586
02:22:37,840 --> 02:22:42,220
civilizations you know when there's

3587
02:22:39,970 --> 02:22:45,570
other things too like I'm not very happy

3588
02:22:42,220 --> 02:22:49,630
with the Saudi Arabs and the Wahabis I

3589
02:22:45,570 --> 02:22:51,550
don't think they're our allies I don't

3590
02:22:49,630 --> 02:22:54,070
see how any Western woman can possibly

3591
02:22:51,550 --> 02:22:55,930
think that they're our allies and I'm

3592
02:22:54,070 --> 02:22:57,100
not happy with the fact that the petrol

3593
02:22:55,930 --> 02:23:01,560
dollars that we send them are

3594
02:22:57,100 --> 02:23:04,510
transformed in substantial part into the

3595
02:23:01,560 --> 02:23:07,030
kind of propaganda that's definitely a

3596
02:23:04,510 --> 02:23:09,120
threat to the West and I'm not very

3597
02:23:07,030 --> 02:23:13,690
happy with the fact that our politicians

3598
02:23:09,120 --> 02:23:15,310
appear stupidly blind to that now that

3599
02:23:13,690 --> 02:23:17,850
may again be a consequence of my

3600
02:23:15,310 --> 02:23:22,660
ignorance it's certainly possible but

3601
02:23:17,850 --> 02:23:29,860
those are the sorts of things that that

3602
02:23:22,660 --> 02:23:31,420
I can't reconcile and so you know I've

3603
02:23:29,860 --> 02:23:33,190
seen that I've also seen parallels

3604
02:23:31,420 --> 02:23:35,580
between the ideas that I'm presenting

3605
02:23:33,190 --> 02:23:40,360
here and other religious traditions

3606
02:23:35,580 --> 02:23:41,950
Taoism and Buddhism Hinduism it's harder

3607
02:23:40,360 --> 02:23:44,560
for me to bridge the gap with Islam and

3608
02:23:41,950 --> 02:23:45,880
I'm not sure why that is I think it has

3609
02:23:44,560 --> 02:23:48,850
something to do with the things that I

3610
02:23:45,880 --> 02:23:50,860
just laid out now what I don't know

3611
02:23:48,850 --> 02:23:52,630
about Islam would feel very many volumes

3612
02:23:50,860 --> 02:23:54,430
many of which I have sitting on my

3613
02:23:52,630 --> 02:23:56,830
shelves at home right now because I want

3614
02:23:54,430 --> 02:23:59,790
to do the reading you know as I progress

3615
02:23:56,830 --> 02:23:59,790
through this but

3616
02:24:09,469 --> 02:24:15,049
good evening dr. Pearson thanks for

3617
02:24:12,049 --> 02:24:19,810
continuing this series even as atheists

3618
02:24:15,049 --> 02:24:22,339
appreciate the interaction and the the

3619
02:24:19,810 --> 02:24:25,359
conversation I wanted to ask you

3620
02:24:22,339 --> 02:24:28,569
something that is both emotional and

3621
02:24:25,359 --> 02:24:33,109
analytical because oftentimes you're

3622
02:24:28,569 --> 02:24:35,299
basically pegged as seeing things very

3623
02:24:33,109 --> 02:24:41,029
analytically so you were talking earlier

3624
02:24:35,299 --> 02:24:45,459
about you were talking about the the the

3625
02:24:41,029 --> 02:24:45,459
juxtaposition between happiness and

3626
02:24:45,759 --> 02:24:51,739
honor even though I don't think they're

3627
02:24:48,679 --> 02:24:53,390
mutually exclusive personally but if

3628
02:24:51,739 --> 02:24:56,449
there's a situation let's say where

3629
02:24:53,390 --> 02:24:57,979
someone is truly in love with someone

3630
02:24:56,449 --> 02:25:00,229
else and they love them for many years

3631
02:24:57,979 --> 02:25:03,409
and decades they have a whole history

3632
02:25:00,229 --> 02:25:08,029
together and then someone and then one

3633
02:25:03,409 --> 02:25:10,939
of the people in this grouping start

3634
02:25:08,029 --> 02:25:14,479
falling in love with someone else so

3635
02:25:10,939 --> 02:25:18,020
it's not that there's less love for the

3636
02:25:14,479 --> 02:25:21,379
original partner how analytically and

3637
02:25:18,020 --> 02:25:24,289
emotionally do you take care of a

3638
02:25:21,379 --> 02:25:27,909
situation like that when you feel that

3639
02:25:24,289 --> 02:25:30,319
you want to stay honorable and be happy

3640
02:25:27,909 --> 02:25:32,989
okay so the first thing I would say is

3641
02:25:30,319 --> 02:25:36,589
the devil is always in the details right

3642
02:25:32,989 --> 02:25:40,069
so one of the things that I'm not happy

3643
02:25:36,589 --> 02:25:43,489
about with much modern moral theorizing

3644
02:25:40,069 --> 02:25:45,379
is that it takes a story like that you

3645
02:25:43,489 --> 02:25:48,049
know and then tries to extract out a

3646
02:25:45,379 --> 02:25:50,929
general moral principle and often that's

3647
02:25:48,049 --> 02:25:53,539
impossible because the particulars of

3648
02:25:50,929 --> 02:25:56,449
the situation are very important but

3649
02:25:53,539 --> 02:25:59,179
having said that all right so let me

3650
02:25:56,449 --> 02:26:01,159
think about that for a minute I'm not

3651
02:25:59,179 --> 02:26:02,929
sure that it's possible to be honorable

3652
02:26:01,159 --> 02:26:05,539
in a situation like that because I think

3653
02:26:02,929 --> 02:26:08,270
that you've acted out the violation

3654
02:26:05,539 --> 02:26:11,060
already and having acted out the

3655
02:26:08,270 --> 02:26:13,209
violation to confess it might be the

3656
02:26:11,060 --> 02:26:16,459
right thing to do although perhaps not

3657
02:26:13,209 --> 02:26:18,079
you know because if you it isn't obvious

3658
02:26:16,459 --> 02:26:19,609
to me that if you betray someone then

3659
02:26:18,079 --> 02:26:23,859
you get to have the right to tell them

3660
02:26:19,609 --> 02:26:31,149
about it I know I know you're not

3661
02:26:23,859 --> 02:26:34,390
yeah yeah I understand I understand my

3662
02:26:31,149 --> 02:26:36,520
observation has been that if there's a

3663
02:26:34,390 --> 02:26:37,989
tight relationship and if one party is

3664
02:26:36,520 --> 02:26:40,560
betrayed by the other in that matter

3665
02:26:37,989 --> 02:26:45,909
that it's almost always irreconcilable

3666
02:26:40,560 --> 02:26:47,770
it breaks it and you know I've helped

3667
02:26:45,909 --> 02:26:49,390
people try to struggle through that but

3668
02:26:47,770 --> 02:26:51,310
on both sides of it the person who was

3669
02:26:49,390 --> 02:26:52,779
betrayed and the person who did the

3670
02:26:51,310 --> 02:26:55,390
betrayal

3671
02:26:52,779 --> 02:26:57,159
I've seen people grow up and not do it

3672
02:26:55,390 --> 02:26:59,590
again and this was in situations where

3673
02:26:57,159 --> 02:27:01,449
their partner didn't know and in a

3674
02:26:59,590 --> 02:27:03,340
couple of those situations it seemed to

3675
02:27:01,449 --> 02:27:05,619
me that it might have even been a

3676
02:27:03,340 --> 02:27:08,710
necessary learning experience for the

3677
02:27:05,619 --> 02:27:11,010
person who did it you know it it helped

3678
02:27:08,710 --> 02:27:14,020
them develop and that doesn't mean I'm

3679
02:27:11,010 --> 02:27:20,260
justifying it but life is complicated

3680
02:27:14,020 --> 02:27:23,409
but but I think that society works

3681
02:27:20,260 --> 02:27:25,859
better all things considered when you

3682
02:27:23,409 --> 02:27:28,119
make a promise and you stick to it and

3683
02:27:25,859 --> 02:27:32,319
one of the things I learned from reading

3684
02:27:28,119 --> 02:27:35,199
young which which I really liked was you

3685
02:27:32,319 --> 02:27:37,060
know he believed that and he had his

3686
02:27:35,199 --> 02:27:40,779
affairs too so you might think about it

3687
02:27:37,060 --> 02:27:42,180
as somewhat hypocritical but but I think

3688
02:27:40,779 --> 02:27:44,590
that people can make mistakes without

3689
02:27:42,180 --> 02:27:46,960
having what they think necessarily be

3690
02:27:44,590 --> 02:27:49,359
wrong you know he said that there are

3691
02:27:46,960 --> 02:27:52,180
things in a marriage that you can't have

3692
02:27:49,359 --> 02:27:54,819
unless you're all-in and I believe that

3693
02:27:52,180 --> 02:27:57,789
I believe that and so if there's a back

3694
02:27:54,819 --> 02:27:59,859
door open or though like to begin with

3695
02:27:57,789 --> 02:28:00,909
or a back door opens then I think that

3696
02:27:59,859 --> 02:28:04,689
there's something about the relationship

3697
02:28:00,909 --> 02:28:07,449
that is lacking at least and I think you

3698
02:28:04,689 --> 02:28:09,159
pay a big price for that so I mean it

3699
02:28:07,449 --> 02:28:12,579
depends on whether you regard a marriage

3700
02:28:09,159 --> 02:28:14,529
as a practical arrangement or a

3701
02:28:12,579 --> 02:28:18,130
spiritual arrangement now really it's

3702
02:28:14,529 --> 02:28:19,689
both you know and both are important but

3703
02:28:18,130 --> 02:28:22,510
if it's a spiritual arrangement or a

3704
02:28:19,689 --> 02:28:26,199
psychological arrangement above all then

3705
02:28:22,510 --> 02:28:28,149
I do think that you don't get the

3706
02:28:26,199 --> 02:28:30,939
transformation without being all-in and

3707
02:28:28,149 --> 02:28:32,229
if you violate it then even if you can

3708
02:28:30,939 --> 02:28:35,170
work it out with your partner there's

3709
02:28:32,229 --> 02:28:36,510
something that you will never get as a

3710
02:28:35,170 --> 02:28:38,840
consequence

3711
02:28:36,510 --> 02:28:38,840
so

3712
02:28:40,230 --> 02:28:47,990
[Applause]

3713
02:28:44,470 --> 02:28:50,810
last question okay I hope I'll make this

3714
02:28:47,990 --> 02:28:53,030
good thanks also for a continuing the

3715
02:28:50,810 --> 02:28:54,860
lecture series I haven't listened to all

3716
02:28:53,030 --> 02:28:58,010
of the lectures but it seems like you

3717
02:28:54,860 --> 02:28:59,900
focus very much on the appeal of the

3718
02:28:58,010 --> 02:29:02,180
bible-- of stories to the individual

3719
02:28:59,900 --> 02:29:03,890
psychology you have any thoughts on the

3720
02:29:02,180 --> 02:29:06,680
relative importance of crowd psychology

3721
02:29:03,890 --> 02:29:09,080
to the appeal and staying power of the

3722
02:29:06,680 --> 02:29:11,030
bible and also the the reason why the

3723
02:29:09,080 --> 02:29:14,510
Bible or the biblical stories took

3724
02:29:11,030 --> 02:29:17,330
precedence over other ideologies which

3725
02:29:14,510 --> 02:29:25,820
could have taken its place okay well

3726
02:29:17,330 --> 02:29:28,310
let's go to the second one first I think

3727
02:29:25,820 --> 02:29:32,450
it's the same thing that happens when

3728
02:29:28,310 --> 02:29:37,490
someone both creates and edits a great

3729
02:29:32,450 --> 02:29:39,050
movie it's no one knows like imagine how

3730
02:29:37,490 --> 02:29:40,550
many choices are there in a great movie

3731
02:29:39,050 --> 02:29:42,350
let's say it's an animated movie because

3732
02:29:40,550 --> 02:29:44,930
absolutely everything in an animated

3733
02:29:42,350 --> 02:29:47,030
movie is constructed everything there's

3734
02:29:44,930 --> 02:29:49,460
God only knows how many choices like

3735
02:29:47,030 --> 02:29:53,000
maybe there's millions of choices you

3736
02:29:49,460 --> 02:29:56,510
know and each choice is guided by some

3737
02:29:53,000 --> 02:29:58,660
intuition of narrative suitability or

3738
02:29:56,510 --> 02:30:01,430
beauty or there's some higher ideal

3739
02:29:58,660 --> 02:30:03,200
motivating it right the desire to

3740
02:30:01,430 --> 02:30:04,550
produce a masterpiece maybe that's it

3741
02:30:03,200 --> 02:30:06,680
that was certainly the case with the

3742
02:30:04,550 --> 02:30:11,450
Disney movies for example and so that

3743
02:30:06,680 --> 02:30:14,110
that aspiration then then makes the

3744
02:30:11,450 --> 02:30:16,850
decisions and so I would say well

3745
02:30:14,110 --> 02:30:19,310
something like that guided the writing

3746
02:30:16,850 --> 02:30:23,330
and the selection of the stories in in

3747
02:30:19,310 --> 02:30:25,010
the biblical canon now could have there

3748
02:30:23,330 --> 02:30:26,720
been other stories included well the

3749
02:30:25,010 --> 02:30:28,280
Catholics and the Protestants don't have

3750
02:30:26,720 --> 02:30:30,560
the same biblical tradition and neither

3751
02:30:28,280 --> 02:30:33,350
do the Jews and the Christians and so it

3752
02:30:30,560 --> 02:30:35,690
isn't exactly clear what to make of that

3753
02:30:33,350 --> 02:30:37,730
you know I mean that's akin in some

3754
02:30:35,690 --> 02:30:43,070
sense to the discussion we just had

3755
02:30:37,730 --> 02:30:46,730
about Islam and Christianity in some

3756
02:30:43,070 --> 02:30:48,800
sense I've left that aside that specific

3757
02:30:46,730 --> 02:30:51,080
question except insofar as I've just

3758
02:30:48,800 --> 02:30:53,480
answered because I'm trying to take what

3759
02:30:51,080 --> 02:30:55,340
we have which I know is that their route

3760
02:30:53,480 --> 02:30:56,479
of our culture and to figure out what it

3761
02:30:55,340 --> 02:31:01,219
is that we have

3762
02:30:56,479 --> 02:31:03,739
why it is that we have it well I've made

3763
02:31:01,219 --> 02:31:05,930
some attempt to explain that in the

3764
02:31:03,739 --> 02:31:07,909
manner that I just described but I don't

3765
02:31:05,930 --> 02:31:12,619
have a final answer I could it have been

3766
02:31:07,909 --> 02:31:14,479
different it could have been different

3767
02:31:12,619 --> 02:31:16,789
at some levels but the same at others

3768
02:31:14,479 --> 02:31:19,609
you know I mean one of the things it's

3769
02:31:16,789 --> 02:31:21,589
the scholars of comparative religion who

3770
02:31:19,609 --> 02:31:23,869
haven't been infected fatally with

3771
02:31:21,589 --> 02:31:26,629
post-modernism have definitely realized

3772
02:31:23,869 --> 02:31:28,689
so young for example in Le ah de people

3773
02:31:26,629 --> 02:31:30,829
who are interested in grand narratives

3774
02:31:28,689 --> 02:31:32,810
one of the things they pointed out quite

3775
02:31:30,829 --> 02:31:35,149
clearly is that there's there's there's

3776
02:31:32,810 --> 02:31:37,249
a set of common mythological themes

3777
02:31:35,149 --> 02:31:39,529
across many cultures and I tried to

3778
02:31:37,249 --> 02:31:41,509
outline that in maps of meaning and that

3779
02:31:39,529 --> 02:31:43,249
worked out quite nicely for me at least

3780
02:31:41,509 --> 02:31:44,899
as far as I was concerned because once I

3781
02:31:43,249 --> 02:31:46,459
had the basic archetypal structure

3782
02:31:44,899 --> 02:31:47,810
mapped out it opened up all sorts of

3783
02:31:46,459 --> 02:31:49,999
stories to me from all sorts of

3784
02:31:47,810 --> 02:31:51,919
different cultures and that's been

3785
02:31:49,999 --> 02:31:54,169
unbelievably useful like the

3786
02:31:51,919 --> 02:31:56,149
Mesopotamian story of it the Anu mulisch

3787
02:31:54,169 --> 02:31:57,949
when I figured out what that meant as

3788
02:31:56,149 --> 02:32:00,619
far as I was concerned like I've never

3789
02:31:57,949 --> 02:32:02,209
forgotten that it just seared itself

3790
02:32:00,619 --> 02:32:04,669
into my memory and the same with the

3791
02:32:02,209 --> 02:32:06,350
Egyptian stories and you know some

3792
02:32:04,669 --> 02:32:09,469
Buddhist writings that I've read in some

3793
02:32:06,350 --> 02:32:11,930
the daodejing is also very powerful so I

3794
02:32:09,469 --> 02:32:14,029
think that things can be different on

3795
02:32:11,930 --> 02:32:16,069
one level and the same at another but

3796
02:32:14,029 --> 02:32:18,589
that humanity kind of coalesce is on

3797
02:32:16,069 --> 02:32:20,539
what's the same over a reasonable period

3798
02:32:18,589 --> 02:32:23,029
of time because there isn't that many

3799
02:32:20,539 --> 02:32:25,850
ways that human beings can live properly

3800
02:32:23,029 --> 02:32:28,909
as individuals and as groups together

3801
02:32:25,850 --> 02:32:31,159
and so there's this constant force that

3802
02:32:28,909 --> 02:32:33,350
makes our ethical presuppositions

3803
02:32:31,159 --> 02:32:35,899
converge and then that's automatically

3804
02:32:33,350 --> 02:32:37,999
expressed in the stories it's something

3805
02:32:35,899 --> 02:32:42,069
like that now it's an imperfect process

3806
02:32:37,999 --> 02:32:42,069
and it's full of error so

3807
02:32:48,229 --> 02:32:55,109
so just one announcement well two

3808
02:32:53,189 --> 02:32:56,819
announcements the next lecture I believe

3809
02:32:55,109 --> 02:32:59,279
is November 14th so I'll hopefully

3810
02:32:56,819 --> 02:33:02,399
finish off the story of Jacob looks like

3811
02:32:59,279 --> 02:33:05,340
it and then I'm also appearing on a

3812
02:33:02,399 --> 02:33:08,160
panel with God's odd and or an Amity on

3813
02:33:05,340 --> 02:33:10,050
November 11th and there's still quite a

3814
02:33:08,160 --> 02:33:11,370
few tickets available for that so if

3815
02:33:10,050 --> 02:33:13,770
you're interested you could go to my

3816
02:33:11,370 --> 02:33:15,870
website and pick up those tickets huh it

3817
02:33:13,770 --> 02:33:18,149
should be well hopefully it'll be

3818
02:33:15,870 --> 02:33:20,310
interesting I think it will be and might

3819
02:33:18,149 --> 02:33:24,240
be too interesting that's one

3820
02:33:20,310 --> 02:33:26,460
possibility so we'll see but I'm gonna

3821
02:33:24,240 --> 02:33:28,649
do two more of these this year and I

3822
02:33:26,460 --> 02:33:30,120
hope I get through the story of Joseph

3823
02:33:28,649 --> 02:33:32,189
and then I can start in the New Year

3824
02:33:30,120 --> 02:33:34,529
with it with Exodus and that's a story

3825
02:33:32,189 --> 02:33:36,450
that I know quite well and that the

3826
02:33:34,529 --> 02:33:40,590
Exodus and Leviticus and what's the one

3827
02:33:36,450 --> 02:33:41,880
after that yes thank you so I'm very

3828
02:33:40,590 --> 02:33:44,120
much looking forward to that because

3829
02:33:41,880 --> 02:33:46,950
that is one killer story that so and

3830
02:33:44,120 --> 02:33:49,500
I've got some surprises for that as well

3831
02:33:46,950 --> 02:33:51,240
so anyways thank you very much for

3832
02:33:49,500 --> 02:33:54,470
coming and hopefully we'll see you

3833
02:33:51,240 --> 02:33:54,470
November 14th
