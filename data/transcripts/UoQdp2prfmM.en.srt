1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
oh

2
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:22,189
Hello, everyone. Thank you again for showing up, so

3
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:26,779
tonight

4
00:00:26,909 --> 00:00:31,129
We're going to finish off the story of Noah and also

5
00:00:31,919 --> 00:00:33,919
the story of

6
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,880
the Tower of Babel

7
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:38,389
and I don't think that'll take very long and

8
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,090
then we're going to

9
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,660
turn to the abrahamic Stories and

10
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,519
They're a very complex set of stories. They sit between

11
00:00:51,179 --> 00:00:52,440
the

12
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,480
Earliest stories in Genesis that I would say end with the tower of babel

13
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,829
And then the stories of moses which are extraordinarily well-developed

14
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,669
Abrahamic stories, there's a whole sequence of them

15
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,380
multiple stories

16
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,380
conjoined together and

17
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:11,540
There I found them very daunting

18
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:14,029
they're very difficult to understand and

19
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,479
so

20
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:21,048
I'm going to stumble through them the best that I can I would say that's that's probably the best way to think about this because

21
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,460
they

22
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:26,360
Have a narrative content. That's quite strange

23
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:29,299
I

24
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:36,559
was reading a book while doing this called the disappearance of God that I found quite helpful, and

25
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,379
the author of that book argues that

26
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:46,909
one of the things that happens in the old testament is that

27
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:50,180
God is very manifest at the beginning

28
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:55,219
in terms of personal appearances even and then that

29
00:01:55,829 --> 00:02:00,409
proclivity fades away as the old testament develops, and there's a

30
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:04,469
parallel development

31
00:02:04,469 --> 00:02:11,119
That it's maybe maybe causally linked. I'm not exactly sure how to conceptualize it, but that appears to be causally linked is that?

32
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:14,390
the

33
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:21,920
Stories about individuals become more and more well-developed so it says in it's as if as God fades away, so to speak

34
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,519
the individual becomes more and more manifest and

35
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:31,969
There's a statement in the old testament the location of which. I don't recall

36
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:37,099
But I'll tell you about it in future lectures where God essentially tells

37
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:45,470
Whoever he's speaking with and I don't remember who that is that he's going to disappear and let man essentially go his own way

38
00:02:45,860 --> 00:02:51,289
And see what happens not a complete disappearance, but maybe a transformations is something that

39
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:59,809
Modern people regard more as a psychological phenomena rather than the sort of objective entity that God seems to be in

40
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:02,150
the beginning of the biblical stories

41
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,970
and so I've been wrestling with that a lot because

42
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:07,790
the notion that

43
00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:11,988
God, I got appears to Abraham multiple times and

44
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:16,220
that's not a concept that's easy for modern people to

45
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:19,010
to grasp in

46
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,970
for us

47
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:24,199
generally speaking apart from say issues of Faith

48
00:03:24,989 --> 00:03:26,819
God is it some?

49
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:28,049
thing

50
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:32,119
someone who makes himself personally manifest in our lives

51
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:34,819
He doesn't appear to us

52
00:03:36,359 --> 00:03:40,219
That's I suppose why the question of belief is so paramount for modern people

53
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:46,789
I presume that if God had within the habit of appearing to you you likely wouldn't have a problem with belief

54
00:03:46,790 --> 00:03:52,280
I mean it might be more complicated than that, but that's how it seems to me, and so when we read stories about

55
00:03:55,049 --> 00:04:01,279
God making himself manifest either to a nation say in the case of israel or to individuals

56
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:04,069
It's not easy to understand

57
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:10,879
It's not easy to understand why people would write stories like that if they thought like we thought and I mean it really it wasn't

58
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:15,319
That long ago that the Bible was written say from a biological perspective. It's really only yesterday

59
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:18,948
It's a couple thousand years say four thousand years something like that

60
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:24,649
That's not very long ago from a biological perspective, it's it's nothing

61
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:27,450
so

62
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:29,450
the first thing I tried to do is to

63
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:34,500
see if I could figure out how to understand that and so else the lecture once we finish the the

64
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:41,699
remains of the story of Noah, I'll start the lecture with a with an attempt to

65
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:48,090
Situate the abrahamic stories in a context that might make them more accessible

66
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:50,760
These two contexts that work for me to make them more accessible

67
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,730
Let's conclude

68
00:04:54,730 --> 00:04:56,470
the Noah Story

69
00:04:56,470 --> 00:04:58,739
first however when we

70
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,660
ended last time

71
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:07,109
The ark had come to its resting place and Noah and his family had

72
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:10,360
debarked

73
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,830
and

74
00:05:11,830 --> 00:05:13,830
so this is the stories of

75
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:17,159
What occurs immediately after afterwards?

76
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:21,359
it's a very short story, but I think it's it's very relevant for

77
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:23,170
both

78
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:27,689
Of these stories the tower of babel is well very relevant for our current times and the sons of Noah

79
00:05:28,450 --> 00:05:32,280
That went forth of the ark were shem, and ham and Japheth and ham

80
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:35,130
Is the father of Canaan?

81
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:41,670
These are the three sons of Noah and of them was the whole Earth overspread and Noah began to be a husbandman

82
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:45,000
and he planted a vine yard and

83
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:49,740
he drank of the wine and was drunken and he was uncovered within his tent and

84
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:56,160
Ham the father of Canaan saw the nakedness of his father and told his two brethren without?

85
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:01,980
and shem and Japheth took a garment and laid upon both their shoulders and went backward and

86
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:07,139
Covered the nakedness of their father and their faces were backward and they saw not their fathers nakedness

87
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,769
And Noah awoke from his wine and knew what his younger son

88
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:17,970
had done unto him and he said curse had to be Canaan a servant of servants shall he be unto his brethren and

89
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:25,829
He said blessed shall be the lord. God of shem and Canaan Shall be his servant and God shall enlarge Japheth

90
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:29,069
And he shall dwell in the tents of shem and Canaan Shall be his servant

91
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:36,389
and Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years and all the days of Noah were 950 years and he died and

92
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:41,310
the whole Earth was of one language and of one speech okay, so

93
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,170
I remember thinking about this story

94
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:49,710
It's got to be 30 years ago

95
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:56,640
And I think the meaning of the story stood out for me sometimes

96
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:04,170
When you read complicated material sometimes a piece of it will stand out. It's for some reason. It's like it glitters

97
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:06,869
I suppose that might be one way of thinking about it. It's

98
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,530
it

99
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:14,640
You're in sync with it, and you can understand what it means. I've really experienced that reading the Dao. De Jing which is document

100
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:18,569
I would really like to do a lecture on at some point because some of the verses

101
00:07:18,570 --> 00:07:20,460
I don't understand but others stand right out

102
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:24,540
and I can understand them and I think I understood what this part of the story of Noah meant and I

103
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:30,060
think it means you know we talked a little bit about what nakedness meant in the story of Adam and Eve and

104
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:36,480
The idea essentially was that to know yourself naked is to become aware of your vulnerability

105
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:40,949
the physical Your physical boundaries in time and space and

106
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,209
Your your your physiological

107
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:48,060
your fundamental physiological

108
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:52,109
Insufficiencies as they mate might be judged by others, so there's biological

109
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:57,689
Insufficiency that sort of built into you because you're a fragile Mortal vulnerable half insane creature

110
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:00,989
And that's that's just an existential truth, and then of course

111
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:02,800
even

112
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,120
merely as a

113
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:09,570
Human being even with all those faults there are faults that you have that are particular to you that might be

114
00:08:09,729 --> 00:08:11,250
judged harshly by the group

115
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:13,559
Well might be will definitely be judged

116
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:19,200
Harshly by the group and so to become aware of your nakedness is to become self-conscious and and to and to

117
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:23,129
Know your limits and to know your vulnerability, and that's what is

118
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:25,000
revealed

119
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,880
To ham when he comes across his father naked and so the question is

120
00:08:30,610 --> 00:08:37,680
What does it mean to see your father naked and it seems to me and especially in an inappropriate Manner like this it it?

121
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,500
it's it's it's as if

122
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,320
ham

123
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:47,429
He does the same thing that happens in the mesopotamian creation myth

124
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:51,900
When when time out and absolute give rise to the first gods

125
00:08:52,989 --> 00:08:55,379
there there the father of the eventual

126
00:08:56,050 --> 00:08:57,339
deity of

127
00:08:57,339 --> 00:08:58,959
redemption Marduk

128
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:03,448
they're very careless and noisy and they kill apps, ooh their father and

129
00:09:03,639 --> 00:09:08,068
attempt to inhabit his corpse and that makes timeout enraged and so she

130
00:09:08,889 --> 00:09:10,869
Bursts Forth from The Darkness to

131
00:09:10,869 --> 00:09:15,749
To do them in it's like a precursor to the flood story or an analogue to the flood story

132
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:19,799
And I see the same thing happening here with ham. Is that he's is

133
00:09:20,499 --> 00:09:22,798
insufficiently respectful of his father and

134
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:27,568
The question is exactly what does the father represent and you can say well there's there's?

135
00:09:28,179 --> 00:09:33,809
There's the father that you have and that's a human being that's the demand like other men a man among men

136
00:09:33,939 --> 00:09:37,738
but then there's the farther as such and that's the spirit of the father and

137
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:43,439
Insofar as you have a father you have both at the same time you have the personal father

138
00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:46,109
That's a man among other men

139
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:53,579
just like anyone others father, but insofar as that man is your father that means that he's something different than just another person and

140
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,079
what he is is the

141
00:09:56,079 --> 00:09:58,798
incarnation of the spirit of the Father and

142
00:09:59,709 --> 00:10:02,969
to see that to take it to what to

143
00:10:03,459 --> 00:10:07,919
Disrespect that carelessly, maybe even he's like no one makes a mistake right? He?

144
00:10:09,819 --> 00:10:12,539
produces wine and gets himself drunk and you might say well

145
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:17,939
you know if he sprawled out there for everyone to see it's hardly hams fault if he stumbles across them but

146
00:10:18,999 --> 00:10:25,678
The book is laying out a danger and the danger is that well maybe you catch your father at

147
00:10:25,929 --> 00:10:28,169
his most vulnerable moment and if you're

148
00:10:29,199 --> 00:10:30,519
disrespectful

149
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:36,149
Then you transgress against the spirit of the father and if you transgress against the spirit of father and lose

150
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:44,008
Spirit of the father and lose respect for the spirit of the father then that is likely to transform you into a slave

151
00:10:44,619 --> 00:10:47,849
That's a very interesting idea and I think it's particularly interesting

152
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:56,308
Maybe not particularly interesting, but it's it's particularly germane. I think to our current cultural situation because I think that

153
00:10:57,459 --> 00:11:01,318
We're pushed constantly to see the nakedness of our father so to speak

154
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:05,639
because of the intense criticism, that's

155
00:11:06,339 --> 00:11:11,049
Directed towards our culture and the patriarch of culture, so to speak

156
00:11:11,689 --> 00:11:16,329
we're constantly exposing its weaknesses and vulnerabilities and let's say nakedness and

157
00:11:18,259 --> 00:11:24,459
There's nothing wrong with criticism, but the thing about Criticism is the purpose of criticism is to separate the wheat from the chaff

158
00:11:25,069 --> 00:11:27,069
It's not to burn everything to the ground

159
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:32,529
Right, it's to say well. We're going to carefully look at this we're going to carefully differentiate

160
00:11:32,529 --> 00:11:35,229
We're going to keep what's good and we're going to move away from what's bad

161
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:39,550
But the point of the Criticism isn't to identify everything is bad. It's to

162
00:11:40,129 --> 00:11:45,219
Separate what's good from what's bad so that you can retain. What's good and move towards it and

163
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:53,680
And to be careless at that is deadly because you're inhabited by the spirit of the father right insofar as you're a cultural

164
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:59,349
Construction which of course is something that the that the postmodern neo-Marxists are absolutely?

165
00:11:59,809 --> 00:12:06,879
emphatic about you're a cultural construction insofar as you're a cultural construction, then you're inhabited by the spirit of the father and to be

166
00:12:08,059 --> 00:12:14,739
Disrespectful towards that means to undermine the very structure that makes you not all of what you are certainly

167
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:16,420
Certainly not all of what you are

168
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:23,139
But a good portion of what you are insofar as you're a socialized cultural entity and if you pull out

169
00:12:23,929 --> 00:12:30,189
If you pull the foundation out from underneath that what do you have left you can hardly manage on your own?

170
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:35,289
You know it's just not possible. You're a cultural creation. And

171
00:12:35,929 --> 00:12:38,169
so Ham makes this desperate

172
00:12:38,809 --> 00:12:41,229
error and is Careless about

173
00:12:43,009 --> 00:12:49,959
Exposing himself to the vulnerability of his father something like that. He doesn't without sufficient respect. And the judgment is that

174
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:57,279
not only will he be a slave, but so will all of his descendants, and he's contrasted with the other two sons who I

175
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:04,809
Suppose are willing to give their father the benefit of the doubt something like that, and so when they see him in a compromising position

176
00:13:06,139 --> 00:13:09,039
they handle it with respect and and and

177
00:13:09,949 --> 00:13:11,949
don't capitalize on it and

178
00:13:12,529 --> 00:13:18,279
Maybe that makes them strong. That's what it seems to me, and so I think that's what that story means

179
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:23,220
It has something to do with respect

180
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:30,419
you know and the funny thing about having respect for your culture, and I suppose that's partly why I'm doing the biblical stories is because

181
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:33,329
They're part of a they're part of my culture

182
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,010
they're part of our culture perhaps, but they're certainly part of my culture and

183
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,100
It seems to me that

184
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:46,530
it's worthwhile to treat that with respect to see what you can glean from it and

185
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:50,639
And not kick it when it's down. Let's say

186
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,910
so

187
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:05,340
and so that's how the story of no ends you know and the thing too is Noah is actually a

188
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:11,789
Pretty decent incarnation of the Spirit of the father that which I suppose is one of the things that makes hams

189
00:14:13,450 --> 00:14:19,739
Misstep more egregious is that I mean noah just built an ark and got everybody through the flood man

190
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:27,000
You know it's not so bad, and so maybe the fact that he happened to drink too much wine one day wasn't enough to justify

191
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:29,200
humiliating him and

192
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:33,150
You know I don't think it's pushing the limits of symbolic interpretation

193
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:37,380
To note on a daily basis that we're all contained in an ark

194
00:14:38,170 --> 00:14:44,550
Right, and that's the ark that you could think about that as the ark that's been bequeathed to us by our forefathers. That's the

195
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:49,410
Tremendous infrastructure that we inhabit that we take for granted

196
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,640
Because it works so well

197
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:57,689
that protects us from things that we can't even imagine and we don't have to imagine because we're so well protected and

198
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:02,219
So one of the things that's really struck me hard. I would say about the

199
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:08,340
Disintegration and corruption of the universities is the absolute ingratitude that goes along with that

200
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:10,570
You know what?

201
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:15,809
Criticism as I said it's a fine thing if it's done in the spirit in a proper spirit

202
00:15:15,810 --> 00:15:21,030
And that's the spirit of separating the wheat from the chaff, but it needs to be accompanied by gratitude

203
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:28,439
And it does seem to me that anyone who lives in in the west in the western culture at this time

204
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:32,790
in history and in this place and who hasn't

205
00:15:33,449 --> 00:15:36,178
simultaneously grateful for that is is

206
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:38,040
half-blind

207
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:41,609
at least because it's never been better than this and

208
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:48,299
It could be so much worse and it's highly likely that it will be so much worse because for most of human history

209
00:15:49,359 --> 00:15:51,359
So much worse is the norm

210
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:55,019
so

211
00:15:58,389 --> 00:16:00,389
then there's this little story that

212
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:05,999
Crops up that seems in some ways unrelated to everything that's gone before it

213
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:13,079
But I think it's also an extremely profound little story it took me a long time to figure it out. It's the tower of babel

214
00:16:15,699 --> 00:16:21,149
and it came to pass as they journeyed from the east that they found a plain in the land of shinar and dwelt there that's

215
00:16:22,209 --> 00:16:25,828
Noah's Descendants and the whole Earth was of one language and of one speech

216
00:16:26,439 --> 00:16:31,498
And it came to pass as they journeyed from the east that they found a plain in the land of shinar and they dwelt there

217
00:16:31,499 --> 00:16:33,429
And they said to one another

218
00:16:33,429 --> 00:16:39,238
Go let us make brick and burn them thoroughly and they had brick for stone and slime they head for mortar

219
00:16:40,899 --> 00:16:47,668
So they're establishing a city and they said go let us build a city and a tower whose top may reach

220
00:16:47,709 --> 00:16:53,368
Unto heaven and let us make a name lest. We be scattered abroad upon the face of the Earth

221
00:16:54,429 --> 00:16:55,929
and

222
00:16:55,929 --> 00:17:00,629
the Lord came down to see the city in the tower which the children of men built and

223
00:17:01,389 --> 00:17:07,739
The Lord said behold the people is one and they all have one language and now this they begin to do

224
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:11,849
And now nothing will be restrained from them which they have imagined to do

225
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:17,850
Go to let us go down and there confound their language that they may not understand one another's speech

226
00:17:19,389 --> 00:17:25,349
So the Lord scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of all the earth and they left off to build the city

227
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:32,638
therefore is the name of it called babel because the lord did there confound the language of all the Earth and

228
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,860
From thence did the Lord scattered them abroad

229
00:17:35,529 --> 00:17:37,529
Upon the face of all the Earth

230
00:17:38,409 --> 00:17:43,469
It's a very difficult story to understand and it's on the face of it. It doesn't seem to show

231
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:49,680
God in a very good light although that happens fairly frequently in the old testament as far as I can tell but

232
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:57,629
You know the thing to do if you're reading in the spirit of the text let's say is to remember that

233
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:00,570
It's God that you're talking about and so

234
00:18:02,080 --> 00:18:04,080
Even though you might think that

235
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,240
He's appearing in a bad light

236
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:12,149
Your duty as a reader. I suppose is to assume that you're wrong and that what he did was right

237
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:16,230
And then you're supposed to figure out well, how could it possibly be right because the axiomatic

238
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:21,570
Presupposition is that it's God and whatever he does is right, and you might say well, you can disagree with that

239
00:18:21,570 --> 00:18:25,679
And it's it's also the case that some of the people that God talks to in the old testament

240
00:18:25,930 --> 00:18:33,029
Actually disagree with him and convinced him to alter his actions, but the point still remains that it's God and if he's doing it then

241
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:35,820
By definition. There's a good reason

242
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:44,310
There's an idea much later that John Milton develops in in

243
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,560
Paradise lost

244
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:49,080
Which is an amazing poem

245
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:57,440
And It's it's it's a it's it's  a profound enough poem so that it's almost been incorporated into the biblical structure  I would say so

246
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,150
the Corpus of Christianity

247
00:19:01,690 --> 00:19:03,690
Post Milton

248
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:06,100
was Saturated by

249
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:10,949
the Miltonic stories of Satan's Rebellion none of us in the in the in the

250
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:16,980
Biblical texts or it's only hinted at in very brief passages and Milton wrote his poem

251
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:24,749
To justify the word the ways of God to man, which is quite an ambition really!

252
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:27,600
It's an amazing profound ambition

253
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,600
To try to produce something

254
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,640
to produce a literary work

255
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:38,780
That justifies being to human beings, because that's what Milton was trying to do, so one of my readers here

256
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:41,660
Sent me a link the other day for viewers

257
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:46,770
To a work of philosophy by an australian Philosopher whose name I don't remember

258
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:50,100
Who basically wrote a book saying that:

259
00:19:51,070 --> 00:19:54,749
being as such, human experience, is so corrupt and so

260
00:19:55,450 --> 00:19:59,340
Permeated by suffering that it would be better if it had never existed at all

261
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:02,280
sort of the ultimate expression of Nihilism and

262
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:10,229
Goethe in in Faust his Mephistopheles who's a Satanic character obviously has that as a credo

263
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:13,229
That's that Satan's fundamental motivation is

264
00:20:14,890 --> 00:20:21,719
His objection to creation itself is that creation is so flawed and so rife with suffering that it would be better if it had never

265
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:24,839
existed at all and so that's his motivation for attempting to

266
00:20:25,810 --> 00:20:28,649
continue to Destroy it but in

267
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,320
Milton's Paradise lost

268
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:36,930
Satan is an intellectual figure, and you see that motif emerged very frequently by the way in

269
00:20:37,690 --> 00:20:45,389
popular culture, so for example in the lion king the figure of Skaar who's a Satanic figure is also hyper intellectual and

270
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:52,260
That's very common that you know it's the evil scientist motif or the or the evil advisor to the king the same motif it

271
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:56,520
Encapsulates something about rationality and it what it seems to encapsulate is the idea that

272
00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:05,280
Rationality like Satan is the highest angel in God's heavenly Kingdom. It's a psychological idea. You know that the most powerful

273
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:12,119
Sub element of the human psyche is the intellect and and it's the thing that shines out above all

274
00:21:12,820 --> 00:21:16,259
within the domain of humanity and maybe across the

275
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:21,450
Domain of life itself the human intellect there's something absolutely remarkable about it

276
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:24,119
but it has a flaw and the flaw is that it tends to

277
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:27,989
Fall in love with its own productions and to assume that their total

278
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:30,810
Solzhenitsyn when he was writing the Gulag Archipelago

279
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:34,229
had a warning about that with regards to

280
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:42,900
totalitarian Ideology, and he said that the price of selling your god-given soul to the entrapments of

281
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:48,080
human dogma was slavery and death essentially and

282
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,500
Satan

283
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,720
in Milton's Paradise Lost Satan

284
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:56,890
decides that

285
00:21:56,890 --> 00:22:01,320
He can do without the transcendent he can do without God and that's why he foments rebellion

286
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:09,240
It's something like that and the consequence of that the immediate consequence from Milton's perspective was that as soon as Satan

287
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:13,080
Decided that what he knew was sufficient

288
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:20,600
That he could do without the transcendent which he might think about as the domain outside of what you know something like that

289
00:22:21,090 --> 00:22:23,090
immediately he was in hell and

290
00:22:24,570 --> 00:22:29,419
When I read Paradise lost I was studying totalitarianism, and I thought you know the poet

291
00:22:30,450 --> 00:22:32,720
the true Poet like a prophet

292
00:22:33,390 --> 00:22:35,390
if someone who has

293
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,500
intimations of the future

294
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:43,460
and maybe that's because the poetic mind the philosophical or prophetic mind is a pattern detector and

295
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:48,769
And there are people who can detect the underlying it's like the malady of a nation

296
00:22:49,530 --> 00:22:54,889
Melody is in song the song of a nation and can see how it's going to develop across the centuries you see this you see

297
00:22:54,890 --> 00:23:01,249
That Nietzsche because Nietzsche for example in the mid you know in 1860 or so. I mean he prophesied

298
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:07,400
What was going to happen in the 20th century said that he said specifically that the spectre of Communism would kill

299
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:14,389
Millions of people in the 20th century, it's amazing prophecy. He said that in the notes that became will to power and

300
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:21,919
Dostoyevsky was of the same sort of mind someone who was in touch enough with the fundamental patterns of

301
00:23:23,010 --> 00:23:27,410
Human movement that they could extrapolate out into the future and see what was coming

302
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:32,749
and I mean some people are very good at detecting patterns you know and and uh

303
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:36,020
Milton, I think was of that, sort and

304
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:37,710
I

305
00:23:37,710 --> 00:23:44,869
think he had intimations of what was coming as human rationality became more and more powerful and technology became more and more powerful and the

306
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:48,830
Information was that we would produce systems that dispensed with God

307
00:23:49,710 --> 00:23:55,999
That were completely rational and completely total that would immediately turn everything they touched into something

308
00:23:57,990 --> 00:23:59,940
indistinguishable from Hell, and

309
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,940
then Milton's warning was

310
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,100
embodied in the poem is that

311
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:06,800
the rational mind that

312
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:12,800
Generates a production and then worships it as if it's absolute immediately occupies hell

313
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:17,420
So what does that have to do with the tower of babel?

314
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:23,239
we know it back into 2008 when the

315
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:26,450
When we had that economic collapse?

316
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:29,659
the strange idea emerged politically and that

317
00:24:30,179 --> 00:24:32,569
was the idea of too big to fail and

318
00:24:33,149 --> 00:24:35,689
I thought about that idea for a long time because I thought

319
00:24:36,659 --> 00:24:42,139
There's something deeply wrong with that is one of the things that made Marx wrong

320
00:24:43,649 --> 00:24:50,479
was Marx believed that capital would flow into the hands of fewer and fewer people and that the

321
00:24:51,659 --> 00:24:56,179
dissociation between the rich and the poor would become more extreme as capitalism developed and

322
00:24:58,919 --> 00:25:05,239
Like so many things that Marx said that's it's kind of true. It's kind of true in that

323
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:11,180
The distribution of wealth and in fact a distribution of anything, that's produced

324
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:12,920
Follows a Pareto

325
00:25:12,929 --> 00:25:18,260
Pattern and the Pareto Pattern basically is that a small proportion of people end up with the bulk of the goods

326
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:23,179
And it isn't just money it's it's anything that people produce creatively

327
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,270
ends up in that distribution and

328
00:25:26,789 --> 00:25:30,169
That's actually the economists call that the Matthieu principle

329
00:25:30,169 --> 00:25:32,159
And they take that from a statement in the new testament

330
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:38,148
and the statement is to those who have everything more will be given and from those who have nothing everything will be taken and

331
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:43,729
It's it's a map of the manner in which the world manifests itself where

332
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:49,279
Human creative production is involved and the map seems to indicate that as you start to produce and you're successful

333
00:25:49,529 --> 00:25:53,299
The probability that you will continue to be successful or accelerate

334
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:58,429
Increases as you're successful and as you fail the probability that you will fail starts to accelerate

335
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:03,169
So if your progress to life looks like this or like this

336
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:10,189
something like that and the reason that Marx was right was because he noted that as a

337
00:26:10,649 --> 00:26:17,539
Feature of the capitalist system the reason that he was wrong. Is that it's not a feature that's specific to a capitalist system

338
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:22,489
it's a feature that's general to all systems of creative production that are known and

339
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:30,140
so it's like a natural law and it's enough of a natural law by the way that the distribution of wealth can be modeled by

340
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:37,189
Physical models using the same equations that govern the distribution of gas molecules in a vacuum, so it's a really profound

341
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,500
It's a fundamentally

342
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:45,170
profound observation about the world way the world lays itself out, and it's problematic because if

343
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:49,429
resources accrue

344
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:53,180
unfairly to a small minority of people

345
00:26:53,280 --> 00:27:00,379
and there's a natural law like element to that that has to be dealt with from a social perspective because if the

346
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:07,309
Inequality becomes too extreme then the whole system will destabilize and so you can have an intelligent

347
00:27:07,890 --> 00:27:11,239
discussion about how to mitigate the effects of

348
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,760
the transfer of creative

349
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:17,059
production into the hands of a small number of people

350
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:23,510
Now the other reason however having said that the other reason that Marx was wrong. There's a number of them

351
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:26,299
One is that even though

352
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,400
creative products end

353
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:37,130
Up in the hands of a small number of people it's not the same people consistently across time

354
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:40,459
It's the same proportion of people, and that's not the same thing

355
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:45,500
you know like imagine that there's water going down a drain and you say well look at the

356
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:51,289
Spiral it's permanent, you think well the spiral is permanent, but the water Molecules aren't they're moving through it

357
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:54,380
And it's the same in some sense with the pareto distribution

358
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:59,329
is that there's a 1% and there's always a 1%, but it's not the same people it's

359
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:03,199
the stability of it differs from

360
00:28:04,410 --> 00:28:05,070
culture to culture

361
00:28:05,070 --> 00:28:11,570
but there's a lot of movement in the upper 1% a tremendous amount of movement and one of the reasons for that movement is that

362
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:16,760
things get large and then they get too large and then they collapse and

363
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,410
so in

364
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:22,160
2008 when the politicians said too big to fail

365
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:28,040
They got something truly backwards as far as I can tell and that was

366
00:28:30,870 --> 00:28:35,780
With a reverse the statement was reversed it should have been so big it had to fail

367
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:41,120
And that's what I think the story of the tower of babel is about it's it's a warning

368
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:44,010
against the

369
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:46,010
expansion of the system

370
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:50,720
Until it encompasses everything it's a warning against

371
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,840
Totalitarian presumption so what happens for example

372
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:59,059
When people set out to build the tower of babel as they want to build a structure that reaches to heaven

373
00:28:59,429 --> 00:29:01,230
right so the idea is that

374
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:06,289
It can it can it can replace it can replace the role of God

375
00:29:06,289 --> 00:29:09,829
it's something like that it can erase the distinction between

376
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:14,719
Earth and Heaven, and so there's a utopian kind of vision there as well as we can build a structure

377
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:18,319
That's so large and encompassing that that

378
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,840
That it can replace heaven itself

379
00:29:22,890 --> 00:29:24,480
That's an interesting

380
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:31,579
The fact that that doesn't work and that God objects to it is also extraordinarily interesting and it's an indication to me of the unbelievable

381
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:38,659
Profundity of these stories. It's like I think one thing we should have learned from the 20th century, but of course didn't was that

382
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:46,429
There's something extraordinary dangerous about totalitarian utopian visions. That's something dostoevsky wrote about by the way in his great book

383
00:29:47,010 --> 00:29:53,719
Notes from Underground because Dostoevsky figured out by the early 1900's that there was something very very

384
00:29:54,059 --> 00:30:01,459
Pathological about a utopian vision of perfection that it was profoundly anti-human and and notes in notes from underground

385
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:07,909
He demolishes the notion of utopia one of the things he says that I loved it's so Brilliant said imagine that you

386
00:30:08,309 --> 00:30:11,298
brought the Socialist utopia into being and

387
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:15,710
dostoyevsky says and that human beings had nothing to do except

388
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:19,220
eat

389
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:22,640
Drink and busy themselves with the continuation of the species

390
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,459
He said that the first thing that would happen under circumstances like that

391
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,090
Would be that

392
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:35,510
Human beings would go mad and break the system smash it just so that something unexpected

393
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:38,959
And crazy could happen because human beings don't want

394
00:30:39,809 --> 00:30:45,499
utopian comfort and certainty they want adventure and Chaos and uncertainty and

395
00:30:45,899 --> 00:30:50,389
so that the very notion of a utopia was anti-human because we're not built for

396
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:53,309
static utopia

397
00:30:53,309 --> 00:30:55,309
we're built for a

398
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:57,949
dynamic situation where there's

399
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:04,279
Demands placed on us and where there's the optimal amount of uncertainty

400
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:10,979
Well, we know what happened in the 20th century as a consequence of the widespread

401
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:13,830
promulgation of utopian schemes and

402
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:16,440
what happened was

403
00:31:16,570 --> 00:31:23,610
mayhem on a scale that had never been matched in the entire history of humanity, and that's really saying something because

404
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,890
There was plenty of Mayhem before the 20th century

405
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:34,619
I guess there wasn't as much industrial clout behind it and so so early you

406
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,640
see

407
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:40,289
so early in the biblical narrative you have a warning against Hubris and

408
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:42,820
and

409
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:44,820
some indication that

410
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:48,959
properly functioning systems have an appropriate scale I

411
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:53,880
read an article in the economist magazine this week about the

412
00:31:54,639 --> 00:31:58,949
rise of Nationalist Movements all over the world as a counterbalance to

413
00:32:00,279 --> 00:32:03,749
globalization maybe it's most marked with the European economic community

414
00:32:05,110 --> 00:32:08,339
And the economist writers were curious about why

415
00:32:08,980 --> 00:32:15,779
that counter movement has been developing, but it seems to me that it's also a tower of Babel phenomena is that

416
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:20,789
And maybe this is most evident in the European economic community

417
00:32:22,210 --> 00:32:26,010
to bring all of that multiplicity under the

418
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:31,769
What would you call it under the umbrella of a single unity is?

419
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:39,539
To simultaneously erect a system where the top is so far from the bottom that the bottom has no connection to the top

420
00:32:40,539 --> 00:32:46,559
You know your your your social systems have to be large enough, so they protect you, but small enough

421
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:51,449
So that you have a place in them, and it seems to me perhaps. That's what's happened in

422
00:32:52,179 --> 00:32:57,749
in places like the EEC is that the distance between the typical citizen and the

423
00:32:58,570 --> 00:33:02,340
Bureaucracy that runs the entire structure has got so great

424
00:33:03,010 --> 00:33:04,120
that

425
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:06,120
it's an element of

426
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:12,630
destabilization in and of itself and so people revert back to say nationalistic identities because

427
00:33:13,570 --> 00:33:15,570
It's something that they can

428
00:33:16,690 --> 00:33:18,580
relate to

429
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:22,629
If there's a there's a history there and a shared identity a genuine identity

430
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:30,460
An identity of language and tradition it's not an artificial imposition from the top an artificial abstract imposition

431
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:41,709
in in the egyptian creation myth

432
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:44,919
the version I'm most familiar with

433
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:47,900
in the previous

434
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,980
Creation myth the older one the Mesopotamian creation myth

435
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:53,960
Mostly what you see

436
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:59,230
Menacing humanity is Tiamat she's the dragon of Chaos and so that's nature. It's really

437
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:01,750
It's really mother nature

438
00:34:01,850 --> 00:34:03,850
red in tooth and claw

439
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:06,520
but by the time the egyptians come along

440
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:12,489
It isn't only nature that threatens humanity

441
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:15,400
it's the social structure itself and so the

442
00:34:15,890 --> 00:34:21,219
egyptians had two deities that represented the social structure and one was Osiris who was

443
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:27,429
Like the spirit of the father. He was a great hero who established egypt, but became old and and

444
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:30,429
Willfully blind and and and

445
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:32,630
and

446
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:35,769
senile and he had an evil brother named Seth and

447
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:40,000
Seth was always conspiring to overthrow him and

448
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:42,530
because

449
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:49,749
Osiris ignored him long enough Seth did overthrow chopped him into pieces and distributed all around the kingdom and

450
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:52,990
His son Horus had to come back and fight

451
00:34:53,929 --> 00:34:56,918
Osiris his son Horus had to come back and defeat

452
00:34:56,919 --> 00:34:59,859
Seth to take the Kingdom back. That's how that story ends

453
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:05,110
But the egyptians seem to have realized maybe because they had become bureaucratized to quite a substantial degree

454
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,380
That it wasn't only nature that threatened

455
00:35:09,020 --> 00:35:15,070
Humankind it was also the proclivity of human organizations to become too large too unwieldy

456
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:20,830
too deceitful and to willfully blind and therefore liable to collapse and

457
00:35:21,710 --> 00:35:24,580
Again, I see echoes of that in the story of the tower of babel

458
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,960
so

459
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,960
It's a calling for

460
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,390
A

461
00:35:32,390 --> 00:35:34,390
kind of humility of social engineering

462
00:35:36,319 --> 00:35:39,219
one of the other things I've learned as a social scientist and

463
00:35:41,569 --> 00:35:46,239
I've been warned about this by I would say great social scientists that

464
00:35:48,049 --> 00:35:50,049
You want to be very careful about

465
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:52,190
doing large-scale

466
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:57,220
experimentation with large scale systems because the probability that if you implement a

467
00:35:57,740 --> 00:36:02,919
Scheme in a large-scale social system that that scheme will have the result you intended is

468
00:36:03,799 --> 00:36:08,439
Negligible what will happen will be something that you don't intend and even worse

469
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:12,339
something that works at counter purposes to your original intent and

470
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,970
so and that makes sense because

471
00:36:16,579 --> 00:36:18,969
If you have a very very complex system

472
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:26,049
And you perturb it the probability that you can predict the consequence of the perturbation is extraordinary low obviously

473
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:34,839
If the system works though you think you understand it because it works and so you think it's simpler than it actually is and so

474
00:36:34,839 --> 00:36:37,449
Then you think that your model of it is correct

475
00:36:37,450 --> 00:36:41,769
and then you think that your manipulation of the model which produces

476
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:48,460
The outcome you model will be the outcome that's actually produced in the world that doesn't work at all

477
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:52,150
I Thought about that an awful lot

478
00:36:53,269 --> 00:36:57,189
thinking about how to remediate social systems because obviously they need

479
00:36:58,339 --> 00:37:02,589
Careful attention and adjustment, and it struck me that the proper

480
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:12,309
strategy for implementing social change is to stay within your domain of competence and that

481
00:37:13,670 --> 00:37:17,559
Requires humility which is a virtue that is never

482
00:37:20,809 --> 00:37:25,749
Promoted in Modern culture. I would say it's it's a virtue that you can hardly even talk about

483
00:37:26,569 --> 00:37:28,400
but humility means

484
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:34,119
You're probably not as smart as you think you are and you should be careful and so then the question might be well

485
00:37:34,369 --> 00:37:39,788
Ok you should be careful, but perhaps you still want to do good you want to make some positive changes?

486
00:37:39,789 --> 00:37:45,279
how can you be careful and do good and then I would say well you try not to step out the boundaries of your

487
00:37:45,440 --> 00:37:47,740
competence and you start small and you

488
00:37:48,170 --> 00:37:53,230
start with things that you actually could adjust that you actually do understand that you actually could fix I

489
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:56,589
Mentioned to you at one point that one of the things carl jung said was that

490
00:37:57,829 --> 00:38:03,219
Modern men don't see God because they don't look low enough. It's a very interesting Phrase and

491
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,980
one of the things that I've been

492
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:08,359
Promoting I suppose

493
00:38:08,359 --> 00:38:10,359
Online is the idea that

494
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:13,389
You should restrict your attempts to fix things

495
00:38:15,050 --> 00:38:17,050
to what's

496
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,390
at hand

497
00:38:20,390 --> 00:38:24,609
So there's probably things about you that you could fix right things that you know that aren't right?

498
00:38:25,250 --> 00:38:29,020
Not anyone else's opinion your own opinion that aren't right you can fix them

499
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:32,679
Maybe there's some things that you could adjust in your family that gets hard you

500
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:38,109
Have to have your act together a lot before you can start to adjust your family because things can kick back on you really hard

501
00:38:38,109 --> 00:38:42,609
And you think well it's hard to put yourself together. It's really hard to put your family together

502
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:44,800
Why the hell do you think you can put the world together?

503
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:51,909
right because obviously the world is more complicated than you and your family and so if you if you're stymied in your attempts

504
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:54,879
Even to set your own house in order which of course you are

505
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:59,169
Then you would think that what that would do would be to make you very very leery about

506
00:38:59,990 --> 00:39:03,250
announcing your broad-scale plans for social revolution

507
00:39:05,450 --> 00:39:12,700
Well, it's a peculiar thing because that isn't how it works because people are much more likely to announce their plans for Broad-scale social revolution

508
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:16,000
Than they are to try to set themselves straight or to set their family straight

509
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:21,939
And I think the reason for that is that as soon as they try to set themselves straight or their families the system immediately

510
00:39:22,310 --> 00:39:28,299
kicks back at them right instantly whereas if they announced their plans for large-scale social revolution

511
00:39:29,150 --> 00:39:31,150
the lag between the

512
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:36,129
announcement and the kickback is so long that. They don't recognize that

513
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:43,720
there's any error there and so you know you can get away with being wrong if if nothing falls on you for a while, and

514
00:39:44,510 --> 00:39:46,510
so and it's also

515
00:39:46,849 --> 00:39:54,009
An incitement to hubris because you can now see your your plans for large-scale social revolution and stand back

516
00:39:54,010 --> 00:39:56,290
And you don't get hit by lightning and you think well

517
00:39:56,290 --> 00:40:02,529
I might be right even though you're not you're seriously not right. I might be right and then you think well

518
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:10,389
How wonderful is that especially if you could do it without any real effort, and I really do think fundamentally I believe that

519
00:40:10,390 --> 00:40:17,170
That's what the universities teach students now. That's what they teach them to do. I really believe that and I think it's absolutely appalling

520
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:21,009
And I think it's horribly dangerous

521
00:40:22,610 --> 00:40:26,110
Because it's not that easy to fix things especially if you don't

522
00:40:27,830 --> 00:40:29,830
especially if you're not committed to it and

523
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:34,239
I think you know if you're committed because what you try to do is you try to straighten out your own life first

524
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:39,999
and that's enough like there's a I think it's a statement in the new testament that it's I think it's in the new testament that it's

525
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:42,610
More difficult to rule yourself than to rule the city

526
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:47,710
And that's not a metaphor. It's like all of you. Who've made

527
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,680
announcements to yourself about

528
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:57,009
Changing your diet and going to the gym every January know perfectly well how difficult it is to regulate your own

529
00:40:57,470 --> 00:41:01,509
impulses and to bring yourself under the control of some

530
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:05,170
What would you say?

531
00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:07,450
well-structured and

532
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:09,650
ethical

533
00:41:09,650 --> 00:41:11,390
attentive

534
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:13,370
structure of values

535
00:41:13,370 --> 00:41:20,559
it's extraordinarily difficult and so people don't do it and instead they wander off, and I think they create towers of Babel and

536
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:25,450
the story indicates well those things collapse under their own weight and

537
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:28,090
everyone goes their own Direction I

538
00:41:29,780 --> 00:41:31,780
Think I see that happening

539
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,240
with the LGBT community I

540
00:41:34,850 --> 00:41:42,460
think because one of the things I've noticed it's very interesting because the community is in some sense, it's not a community but

541
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:49,419
That's a technical error, but it's it's composed of outsiders. Let's say and

542
00:41:50,780 --> 00:41:55,390
what you notice across the decades is that the acronym list keeps growing and

543
00:41:56,180 --> 00:42:02,079
I think that's because there's an infinite number of ways to be an outsider and so once you open the door

544
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:06,129
to the construction of a group that's characterized by

545
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:12,819
Failing to fit into the group then you immediately create a category that's infinitely

546
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:21,160
expandable and so I don't know how long the acronym list is now it depends on which acronym list you consult but I've seen

547
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:26,649
lists of 10 or more acronyms and one of the things that's happening is that

548
00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:30,129
The Community is starting to fragment in

549
00:42:30,770 --> 00:42:34,360
Its in its interior because there is no unity

550
00:42:34,910 --> 00:42:38,830
once you put a sufficient plurality under the

551
00:42:39,410 --> 00:42:41,090
sheltering

552
00:42:41,090 --> 00:42:43,269
structure of a single umbrella say

553
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:48,940
the disunity starts to appear within and I think that's also uh

554
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:54,219
It's a manifestation of the same issue that this particular story is dealing with

555
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:05,620
So that ends. I would say the most archaic stories in the in the bible

556
00:43:07,370 --> 00:43:10,719
There's something about the flood story and and also the tower of babel

557
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:14,590
I think they outline the two fundamental dangers that beset Mankind one is

558
00:43:15,470 --> 00:43:17,470
the probability that

559
00:43:18,530 --> 00:43:22,090
Blindness and sin will produce a natural catastrophe or entice one

560
00:43:22,910 --> 00:43:30,730
That's something modern people are very aware of in principle right because we're all hyper concerned about environmental degradation and catastrophe and so

561
00:43:31,460 --> 00:43:33,460
That's the continual

562
00:43:34,280 --> 00:43:39,159
Reactivation of an archetypal idea in our in our unconscious minds that there's something about the way

563
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:42,580
we're living that's unsustainable and that will create a

564
00:43:43,310 --> 00:43:47,799
catastrophe it's so interesting because people believe that firmly and deeply and

565
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:53,530
But they don't see the relationship between that and the archetypal stories because it's the same story

566
00:43:55,910 --> 00:44:02,320
Overconsumption greed all of that is producing an unstable state and nature will rebel and take us down

567
00:44:02,930 --> 00:44:06,370
You hear that every day in every newspaper and every TV station?

568
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:14,530
It's broadcast to you constantly so that idea is presented in in Genesis in the story of Noah and then the other

569
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:19,870
Warning that exists in the stories one is Beware of Natural Catastrophe

570
00:44:19,870 --> 00:44:24,399
That's produced as a consequence of blindness and greed will say the other is

571
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:27,119
Beware of

572
00:44:28,099 --> 00:44:30,099
social structures that overreach

573
00:44:30,710 --> 00:44:36,339
Because they'll also produce fragmentation and disintegration, and so it's quite remarkable. I think that that

574
00:44:37,579 --> 00:44:40,778
With at the close of the story of the tower of babel?

575
00:44:41,539 --> 00:44:43,539
we've got both of

576
00:44:43,759 --> 00:44:46,629
the permanent existential dangers that

577
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:49,720
present themselves to humanity

578
00:44:50,059 --> 00:44:52,059
already identified

579
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:01,029
At the end of the story of Adam and eve. There's like a fall into history

580
00:45:01,700 --> 00:45:06,339
Right so in one way history begins with the fall, but there's like a second fall

581
00:45:06,339 --> 00:45:09,008
I think with the flood and the tower of Babel and

582
00:45:09,529 --> 00:45:15,639
history and even more real sense begins now it begins with this story of Abraham and and it's

583
00:45:16,220 --> 00:45:17,839
it's

584
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:23,078
We're no longer precisely in the realm of the purely mythical. That would be another way of thinking about it

585
00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:28,389
We have identifiable person who's part of an identifiable tribe is doing identifiable things

586
00:45:28,390 --> 00:45:33,099
We're in the realm of history and so history begins twice in the old testament I

587
00:45:34,009 --> 00:45:36,459
suppose it begins again after moses as well, but

588
00:45:37,940 --> 00:45:44,349
We've moved out of the domain of the purely mythical into the realm of history with with the emergence of the stories about abraham

589
00:45:45,619 --> 00:45:47,200
This is from aldous huxley

590
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,629
So the first thing that that I want to talk about in

591
00:45:49,789 --> 00:45:54,099
relationship to the abrahamic stories is this idea of the experience of God because

592
00:45:54,829 --> 00:45:59,469
Abraham although quite identifiable as an actual individual is

593
00:46:00,589 --> 00:46:07,449
Also, characterized by this peculiarity and the peculiarity is that God manifests himself to Abraham

594
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:11,259
Both as a voice and but also as a presence

595
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:18,818
The stories never describe exactly how god manifests himself except now and then he comes in the form of an angel

596
00:46:19,039 --> 00:46:20,749
That's fairly concrete

597
00:46:20,749 --> 00:46:25,209
But it's a funny thing that the author of or authors of the abrahamic story

598
00:46:25,999 --> 00:46:27,499
seems to take

599
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:30,400
The idea that God would make an appearance

600
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:34,520
more or less for granted and so

601
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:36,840
It's very

602
00:46:36,849 --> 00:46:42,129
I think the part of the reason that I've struggled so much with the abrahamic stories is because it's so hard to get a handle

603
00:46:42,130 --> 00:46:44,200
on that and to understand what that might mean and

604
00:46:44,599 --> 00:46:48,099
So I'm going to hit it from a bunch of different perspectives and let's see if we can

605
00:46:48,739 --> 00:46:50,739
Come up with some

606
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:57,430
Understanding of it the first thing I'll do is tell you a story about a female

607
00:46:58,700 --> 00:47:02,739
Neurologist whose name escapes me at the moment. She wrote a book called my stroke of insight

608
00:47:03,950 --> 00:47:06,039
Jill Bolte I think is her name and

609
00:47:07,130 --> 00:47:09,130
She was a harvard-trained

610
00:47:09,890 --> 00:47:11,890
She was she had she had

611
00:47:12,559 --> 00:47:17,199
medical training from Harvard in Neuropsychological function and knew a lot about hemispheric specialization

612
00:47:17,809 --> 00:47:21,819
we talked a little bit about hemispheric specialization before one of the

613
00:47:22,609 --> 00:47:26,588
Ways of conceptualizing the difference between the two hemispheres is that the left hemisphere?

614
00:47:26,839 --> 00:47:33,278
Operates in known territory and the right hemisphere operates in unknown territory. That's one way of thinking about or the left hemisphere operates

615
00:47:33,799 --> 00:47:40,119
in the orderly domain and the right hemisphere operates in the chaotic domain or the left hemisphere operates in the

616
00:47:40,430 --> 00:47:45,609
Domain of detail and the right hemisphere operates in the domain of the large picture

617
00:47:45,950 --> 00:47:50,289
It's something like that now people differ in their neurological wiring, so those are

618
00:47:51,140 --> 00:47:53,259
Over generalizations, but that's okay

619
00:47:53,259 --> 00:47:55,869
we live with that for the time being it's certainly not an

620
00:47:55,940 --> 00:48:02,499
overgeneralization to point out that you do in fact have two hemispheres and that their structures differ and if the connections between them are cut

621
00:48:02,499 --> 00:48:08,859
Which could happen for example if you had surgery for intractable epilepsy that each hemisphere would be capable of housing its own consciousness

622
00:48:09,650 --> 00:48:15,129
That's been well documented by a neural neural neurologist in Gazzaniga

623
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:20,410
Who did and Sperry who did split brain experiments must be 30 years ago now?

624
00:48:21,229 --> 00:48:22,460
so

625
00:48:22,460 --> 00:48:26,259
And we know that the right in the left hemisphere are specialized for different

626
00:48:26,390 --> 00:48:32,140
Functions the right hemisphere for example seems to be more involved in the generation of negative emotion and the left hemisphere more

627
00:48:32,719 --> 00:48:38,109
Involved in the generation of positive emotion an approach so the right hemisphere stops you and the left hemisphere moves you forward

628
00:48:38,779 --> 00:48:40,130
anyways

629
00:48:40,130 --> 00:48:41,539
Jill

630
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:43,880
Bolte I hope I've got that right

631
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:46,340
had a stroke

632
00:48:46,340 --> 00:48:47,310
and

633
00:48:47,310 --> 00:48:53,239
Maintained consciousness during the stroke and analyzed it while it was happening and she was able

634
00:48:53,880 --> 00:48:55,880
while it was happening to

635
00:48:56,340 --> 00:48:59,690
hypothesize about what part of her brain was being destroyed and

636
00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:05,779
what so she had a congenital blood vessel malformation and had an aneurysm and

637
00:49:06,330 --> 00:49:08,330
It just about killed her

638
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:11,150
but she said that

639
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:13,220
It affected her left hemisphere

640
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:20,480
And she said that she experienced a sense of divine unity as a consequence of the stroke

641
00:49:21,120 --> 00:49:27,229
because the left hemisphere function was disrupted and destroyed and so she became a right hemisphere dominant and

642
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:32,659
her experience of that was the dissolution of the specific ego into the

643
00:49:33,810 --> 00:49:40,789
Absolute consciousness something like that now that's only a case study, and you don't want to make too much of case studies

644
00:49:40,790 --> 00:49:43,790
But there is an overwhelming amount of evidence

645
00:49:44,580 --> 00:49:47,569
that those two kinds of consciousness exist

646
00:49:48,210 --> 00:49:49,710
one being

647
00:49:49,710 --> 00:49:51,710
your consciousness of you as a

648
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:56,090
localized and specified being and the other being

649
00:49:57,210 --> 00:49:58,380
this

650
00:49:58,380 --> 00:50:00,180
capacity to experience

651
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:04,639
oceanic dissolution and the sense of the cosmos being one

652
00:50:06,120 --> 00:50:10,549
Now why we have those capacities for different conscious

653
00:50:11,370 --> 00:50:12,450
experiences

654
00:50:12,450 --> 00:50:16,369
Is very difficult to understand. I mean part of me thinks that

655
00:50:16,950 --> 00:50:19,609
Maybe we have a generic human brain

656
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:23,300
it's the brain of the species and

657
00:50:23,850 --> 00:50:25,850
Allied with that we have a specific

658
00:50:25,860 --> 00:50:30,950
individual brain and one is the left hemisphere and the other is the right hemisphere the left hemisphere being the

659
00:50:31,050 --> 00:50:36,650
specific individual brain and usually it's on and working because you obviously have to take care of yourself as a

660
00:50:37,230 --> 00:50:39,740
specific entity and not as a generalized

661
00:50:40,290 --> 00:50:46,130
Cosmic phenomena, it's hard to dice celery when you're a generalized cosmic phenomena

662
00:50:46,380 --> 00:50:51,229
Right so you have to be more pointed than that but but look let's make no mistake about it

663
00:50:51,960 --> 00:50:55,730
The fact that those different states of consciousness exists is not

664
00:50:56,190 --> 00:51:01,709
Disputable they can be elicited in all sorts of ways and so

665
00:51:02,499 --> 00:51:08,579
I'm going to read you something that Aldous Huxley wrote about this back, I think, in 1956 this was after he

666
00:51:11,799 --> 00:51:13,918
Started his experimentation with mescaline

667
00:51:15,039 --> 00:51:21,389
The psychedelics were introduced into western culture in the 1950s in a whole bunch of different ways psilocybin mushrooms

668
00:51:21,759 --> 00:51:25,019
LsD. I was discovered right at the end of World War two

669
00:51:25,869 --> 00:51:27,869
Was discovered by accident actually?

670
00:51:28,390 --> 00:51:35,039
laboratory Sandoz labs the guy who discovered it Albert Hofmann had spilled some on his hands you can absorb it through your skin and

671
00:51:35,619 --> 00:51:42,778
He was biking home and had the world's first LSD trip which was somewhat of a shock to him and then to the entire world

672
00:51:44,499 --> 00:51:47,728
Huxley who was a great literary figure, a real genius

673
00:51:49,539 --> 00:51:51,569
experimented with mescaline in the late fifties and

674
00:51:52,390 --> 00:51:58,169
He wrote a book called the doors of perception which had a huge impact on the emerging psychedelic culture both on

675
00:51:58,419 --> 00:52:05,879
The East coast at Harvard and on the West coast with Ken Kesey and his merry pranksters the people who popularized LSD

676
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:09,900
That's all documented in a book called the electric Kool-Aid acid test; Which I would highly recommend

677
00:52:10,329 --> 00:52:14,609
It's Tom Wolfe it's a brilliant book on the east coast it was timothy leary

678
00:52:14,609 --> 00:52:20,788
I had timothy leary's old job at Harvard. So that was kind of cool. You know in a warped way

679
00:52:21,309 --> 00:52:23,728
So I met people there who knew him

680
00:52:24,489 --> 00:52:28,468
Who didn't think much of them also, but who did know him but

681
00:52:29,109 --> 00:52:33,028
Huxley had this mescaline experience, and it transported him to this

682
00:52:34,089 --> 00:52:35,369
alternative consciousness

683
00:52:35,369 --> 00:52:41,728
And he said that during his mescaline experience that the entire world glowed from within like if there was an inner light

684
00:52:41,890 --> 00:52:46,409
like a paradisal inner light and that everything was deeply meaningful and

685
00:52:47,140 --> 00:52:53,609
Symbolically suggestive and overwhelming and beautiful and timeless so he had an experience of divine

686
00:52:54,249 --> 00:52:59,579
Eternity I suppose is the most straightforward way to to put that and we know perfectly well that

687
00:53:00,009 --> 00:53:05,998
the psychedelic drugs that all share the same chemical structure they interact with the brain chemical called Serotonin

688
00:53:06,609 --> 00:53:08,529
Which is a very very fundamental?

689
00:53:08,529 --> 00:53:11,039
Neurotransmitter they all have approximately the same

690
00:53:12,249 --> 00:53:14,210
range of effects

691
00:53:14,210 --> 00:53:16,069
Although those effects are very

692
00:53:16,069 --> 00:53:20,979
There's a very large multitude of effects that sort of exist underneath that umbrella

693
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:25,180
Huxley was

694
00:53:27,079 --> 00:53:32,829
staggered by his mescaline experience he he didn't really know what to make of it, and I think that that's

695
00:53:33,470 --> 00:53:36,129
the common experience of people who have

696
00:53:36,950 --> 00:53:39,819
exceptionally profound psychedelic experiences and I'll

697
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:44,410
Tell you some documentation about that in a moment, but he spent quite a long time

698
00:53:45,050 --> 00:53:51,009
Trying to come to grips with what this might mean from an intellectual perspective and huxley had a great brain

699
00:53:51,010 --> 00:53:54,879
I mean someone was going to wrestle with the problem like that. He was a good candidate

700
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:57,790
He must have had a verbal IQ of 180. I mean he's

701
00:53:58,460 --> 00:54:05,349
his books are incredibly literate Incredible credible mastery of language and complexity of characterization and and

702
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:07,960
intellectual Discourse really remarkable

703
00:54:09,260 --> 00:54:14,199
So this is what Huxley had to say after his mescaline experience he talked about heaven and hell

704
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:18,369
and he talked about that in reference to bad trips essentially because

705
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:24,430
it was known by that point that a Psychedelic experience could transport you to an

706
00:54:24,770 --> 00:54:27,729
Ecstatic domain of Divine revelation

707
00:54:27,730 --> 00:54:34,689
but could take you to the worst imaginable place as well huxley was very interested in why you would even have the capacity for

708
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:39,520
Experiences like that and which I think is a very good question and it's completely unanswered question

709
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:44,079
I mean, we don't know much about consciousness and we know even less about psychedelics

710
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:49,298
I would say they are an absolute mystery. I don't think we understand them in the least

711
00:54:50,630 --> 00:54:56,109
Huxley did a good job of starting to at least map out the mysteries of the terrain he said like the earth of a hundred

712
00:54:56,109 --> 00:55:02,769
Years ago our mind still has its darkest Africa's its unmapped Borneo's and Amazonian basin in

713
00:55:03,170 --> 00:55:07,030
Relation to the Fauna of these regions. We are not yet zoologists

714
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:12,010
We are mere naturalist sand collectors of specimens the fact is unfortunate

715
00:55:12,010 --> 00:55:14,559
But we have to accept it we have to make the best of it

716
00:55:15,559 --> 00:55:23,379
However, lowly the work of the collector must be done before we can proceed to the higher scientific tasks of classification analysis experiment and theory

717
00:55:23,380 --> 00:55:29,320
Making like the giraffe and the duck-billed platypus the creatures inhabit these remoter regions of the mind

718
00:55:30,380 --> 00:55:32,240
Are exceedingly improbable.

719
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:34,959
Nevertheless they exist they're facts of observation

720
00:55:35,570 --> 00:55:40,630
And as such they cannot be ignored by anyone who is honestly trying to understand the world in which he lives

721
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:48,490
when psychiatrists started to study LSD that

722
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:53,649
was mostly in the late 50s and running forward from that they thought about

723
00:55:54,560 --> 00:56:02,409
The drug as a psychedelic which was a chemical substance that would induce psychosis, but that turned out to not be true

724
00:56:02,930 --> 00:56:05,560
not with the psychedelics because

725
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:08,680
schizophrenics were given LSD and

726
00:56:09,230 --> 00:56:11,230
The schizophrenics reported that

727
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:14,649
while the experience experience was certainly

728
00:56:15,350 --> 00:56:19,180
extraordinarily strange, it wasn't like being schizophrenic and

729
00:56:19,730 --> 00:56:26,709
then it was found later that if you gave schizophrenics amphetamines that made them worse in fact you can induce a

730
00:56:27,170 --> 00:56:31,270
Paranoid psychosis in a normal person by overdosing them with amphetamines

731
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:35,170
So whatever the hallucinogens are the psychedelics are doing

732
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:41,020
It's not the same thing as mania and it's not the same thing as schizophrenia not at all

733
00:56:43,490 --> 00:56:45,490
so

734
00:56:49,930 --> 00:56:57,659
So you can't just write the experience off as an induced psychosis, whatever it is

735
00:56:59,170 --> 00:57:03,029
Independent of its utility or lack thereof it's not that

736
00:57:04,510 --> 00:57:06,510
Now can be induced by drugs

737
00:57:07,450 --> 00:57:11,849
Can be induced by deprivation right? I mean there are accounts throughout history of people

738
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:14,640
putting themselves in Extreme

739
00:57:14,650 --> 00:57:21,389
Physiological situations in order to induce transformations of consciousness fasting is one of the routes to doing that

740
00:57:22,090 --> 00:57:24,090
Dancing is another route

741
00:57:24,190 --> 00:57:31,679
Isolation prolonged periods of isolation will also do it now you could say that exposing yourself to any of those in excess

742
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:34,780
produces a state that's

743
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:36,780
indistinguishable from illness and

744
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:43,679
That there's no reason to assume that the phenomena that are associated with illness have any

745
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:47,680
Utility Whatsoever although, it's interesting to me that

746
00:57:50,460 --> 00:57:56,480
A Disrupted consciousness can Produce coherent experiences. It's not exactly what you expect

747
00:57:56,489 --> 00:57:59,540
It was just an illness you know if you develop say a high fever

748
00:58:00,640 --> 00:58:02,470
your experience

749
00:58:02,470 --> 00:58:09,300
Isn't transcendent and coherent its fragmented and pathologized and and the difference

750
00:58:09,300 --> 00:58:11,430
I think is quite distinct although

751
00:58:11,430 --> 00:58:15,539
We don't only we don't have to only speculate about that because there's been enough experimental work done

752
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:18,660
Now with hallucinogens and psychedelics to indicate that

753
00:58:19,150 --> 00:58:24,269
The notion that what they produce is something that's only akin to Pathology is wrong

754
00:58:24,820 --> 00:58:26,050
because

755
00:58:26,050 --> 00:58:31,540
It's not a matter of opinion at this point in the sequence of scientific and historical

756
00:58:31,540 --> 00:58:33,920
Investigation in fact there was a large-scale study done

757
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:40,620
Ten Years ago? five years ago? of two hundred thousand people who had experimented with pSychedelics

758
00:58:40,620 --> 00:58:47,000
And they were mentally and physically healthier than people who hadn't on virtually every parameter they examined in

759
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:49,320
fact the rate of

760
00:58:49,380 --> 00:58:54,280
Flashbacks, you've heard of LSD flashbacks mostly a hypothetical phenomena

761
00:58:54,300 --> 00:59:00,460
But the rate of self-reported flashbacks was higher among the non psychedelic users than among the psychedelic users

762
00:59:01,400 --> 00:59:07,540
so that was very interesting was a huge study now it might be you could say that those who had experimented with

763
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:14,709
Psychedelics were prone to be healthier to begin with but he that still contradicts the Pathology argument

764
00:59:14,710 --> 00:59:18,520
So it doesn't matter either way the Pathology argument is contradicted

765
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:21,280
now,

766
00:59:24,110 --> 00:59:27,489
oh I did put that in it was Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor

767
00:59:28,430 --> 00:59:30,610
This is what she said about her stroke I

768
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:36,550
Remember that first day of the stroke with terrific bittersweetness in the absence of the normal functioning of my left

769
00:59:36,770 --> 00:59:44,380
Orientation association area my perception of my physical boundaries was no longer limited to where my skin met air. I felt like a genie

770
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:47,380
Liberated from its bottle it's good metaphor

771
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:52,959
The energy of my spirit seemed to flow like a great whale gliding through a sea of silent

772
00:59:53,210 --> 00:59:56,980
Euphoria the absence of Physical Boundary was one of glorious bliss

773
01:00:00,410 --> 01:00:04,899
Recently this Dr. Roland Griffith I

774
01:00:07,010 --> 01:00:13,060
met him once at a conference in San Francisco surprised surprised a

775
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:20,829
Conference on awe and this was just when he was embarking on his experiments with psilocybin which were the first experiments on

776
01:00:21,620 --> 01:00:23,620
hallucinogens that were permitted by the

777
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:30,640
National Institute of Mental Health in some three four decades he had to be very careful to

778
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:38,350
Lay out the scientific protocols so that the ethics committees would approve the experiments and so that the federal funding agencies would

779
01:00:38,570 --> 01:00:42,340
also allow the experiments to go through he started to experiment with

780
01:00:43,460 --> 01:00:45,440
psilocybin and

781
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:48,010
He's found a number of and published a number of very interesting

782
01:00:49,970 --> 01:00:56,260
Results one was that a single psilocybin trip

783
01:00:57,530 --> 01:00:59,090
and I

784
01:00:59,090 --> 01:01:01,090
specified trip because

785
01:01:01,100 --> 01:01:06,160
Sometimes when people take psilocybin out the doses that griffith uses. They don't have a psychedelic experience

786
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:14,140
Most people who take the dose do but not everyone those who take the dose and don't have the mystical experience don't

787
01:01:15,350 --> 01:01:20,259
Experience the consequences of taking the drug and the consequences can be quite profound

788
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:26,590
So one consequence is that if you have the mystical experience that's associated with psilocybin ingestion

789
01:01:27,410 --> 01:01:29,410
You're liable to

790
01:01:30,110 --> 01:01:35,410
Represent that to others and yourself as one of the two or three most experienced important experiences of your entire life

791
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:41,470
So that would be at the same level as the birth of your child or your marriage

792
01:01:41,540 --> 01:01:45,999
let's say assuming that those were transcendent experiences, but that's

793
01:01:47,360 --> 01:01:51,400
But that's how people describe them so that's that's very interesting in and of itself

794
01:01:53,720 --> 01:01:55,010
then

795
01:01:55,010 --> 01:02:00,850
the next thing that griffith another thing that griffith reported was that one year after a

796
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:06,100
Psilocybin dose a single psilocybin dose profound enough to induce a mystical experience

797
01:02:06,770 --> 01:02:08,210
the trait

798
01:02:08,210 --> 01:02:12,339
openness of the participants had increased one standard deviation

799
01:02:12,470 --> 01:02:19,809
Which is a tremendous amount and so it looked like one dose produced a permanent neurological and psychological transformation now

800
01:02:19,810 --> 01:02:22,299
You know I'm not saying that that's a good thing

801
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:26,739
I'm not saying that because I don't think that openness is a

802
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:35,229
Untroubled blessing, but it's certainly a testament to the unbelievable potency of the of the drugs

803
01:02:35,990 --> 01:02:41,260
There's about a 10% chance by the way with psilocybin ingestion of a trip to hell

804
01:02:41,260 --> 01:02:49,030
and so that's certainly something very much worth considering when you're thinking about the potential effects of this kind of

805
01:02:49,820 --> 01:02:51,820
experience

806
01:02:54,320 --> 01:03:01,660
so the the mystical experience produced by psilocybin is rated by people as the most profound among the most profound experience of their life as

807
01:03:01,910 --> 01:03:03,940
life-Changing it produces permanent personality

808
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:08,590
transformations eighty-five percent success in smoking cessation with a single dose

809
01:03:09,740 --> 01:03:17,290
Right that's another thing that griffiths demonstrated now that is mind boggling because there are chemical treatments for smoking cessation

810
01:03:19,340 --> 01:03:21,640
bupropion is one it

811
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:27,010
Reduces craving to some degree, but its success rate is

812
01:03:27,650 --> 01:03:29,650
Nowhere Near 85%

813
01:03:29,990 --> 01:03:32,500
certainly not with a single dose and

814
01:03:33,380 --> 01:03:34,910
so

815
01:03:34,910 --> 01:03:41,470
We don't understand how it can be that that occurs, but it's nicely documented by griffiths team in this

816
01:03:43,339 --> 01:03:46,899
Experiment he gave psilocybin to people who are dying of cancer

817
01:03:49,820 --> 01:03:54,099
cancer patients often develop Chronic clinically significant symptoms of depression and anxiety

818
01:03:54,710 --> 01:04:02,589
Previous studies suggest that psilocybin may decrease depression and anxiety in cancer patients aldous huxley took LSD on his deathbed by the way

819
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:06,489
so the idea that there was something about

820
01:04:07,790 --> 01:04:10,359
psychedelic substances that could

821
01:04:12,050 --> 01:04:19,599
Buffer people against the catastrophes of mortality is an idea. That's as old as experimentation with the drug itself

822
01:04:20,780 --> 01:04:28,419
the effects of psilocybin were studied in 51 cancer patients with life threatening diagnosis and symptoms of depression and/or anxiety

823
01:04:29,329 --> 01:04:31,329
unsurprisingly

824
01:04:34,880 --> 01:04:42,740
I don't really know if it's reasonable to describe the emotional state of people diagnosed with cancer of uncertain Prognosis or

825
01:04:43,340 --> 01:04:46,800
Mortal significance as depression precisely

826
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:51,939
You know you know what I mean is that if you go to the doctor and he tells you that you have intractable

827
01:04:52,490 --> 01:04:53,930
fatal cancer

828
01:04:53,930 --> 01:04:59,139
The normative response is to be rather upset and anxious about that and so it

829
01:04:59,630 --> 01:05:04,270
One of the things that bothers me about clinical psychiatry and clinical psychology is the automatic

830
01:05:04,700 --> 01:05:09,460
Presupposition that even overwhelming states of negative emotion are properly categorized as depression

831
01:05:09,460 --> 01:05:15,429
I don't think you're depressed when you get a cancer diagnosis. I don't think that's the right way to think about it

832
01:05:15,430 --> 01:05:17,200
I think that you have a big problem

833
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:23,560
And it's not surprising that you're overwhelmed by negative emotion and to think about that as a psychiatric malfunction is a major error

834
01:05:24,140 --> 01:05:25,819
but anyways

835
01:05:25,819 --> 01:05:28,179
It's a side issue with regards to this study

836
01:05:30,470 --> 01:05:35,890
the effects of psilocybin were studied in 51 cancer patients with life threatening diagnosis and symptoms of depression

837
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:40,929
And/or anxiety I cannot imagine how they got this through an ethics committee. It's just

838
01:05:41,570 --> 01:05:48,820
We're going to take people who have uncertain diagnosis of cancer that are potentially life-threatening, and we're going to give them psychedelics. It's like

839
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:54,670
But they did it they did it and I think it's a testament to griffiths stature as a researcher that

840
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:57,280
That that was allowable

841
01:05:57,770 --> 01:06:03,310
This is a randomized double-blind crossover trial very carefully designed clinical investigation

842
01:06:04,070 --> 01:06:10,120
people were assigned to the treatment group or the to the drug group or the non drug group randomly blindly and

843
01:06:12,890 --> 01:06:17,499
Investigated the effects of the drug also with different doses which is another hallmark of a well-designed

844
01:06:18,230 --> 01:06:25,330
Pharmacological study very low Placebo like dose 1 or 3 milligrams per 70 kilograms of body weight versus a high dose

845
01:06:25,730 --> 01:06:28,330
22 or 30 milligrams per 70 kilograms of

846
01:06:29,510 --> 01:06:30,710
psilocybin

847
01:06:30,710 --> 01:06:35,919
chemical psilocybin administered in counterbalance sequence with five weeks between sessions and a six-month follow-up

848
01:06:37,730 --> 01:06:45,189
instructions to participants and staff minimized the effects of expectancy participant staff and community observers rated

849
01:06:45,620 --> 01:06:48,939
Participant Moods attitudes and behaviors throughout the study, that's also

850
01:06:49,070 --> 01:06:56,380
The Hallmark of a well-designed study because they didn't rely on a single source of information for the outcome data right they got self reports

851
01:06:56,380 --> 01:06:57,950
That's fine, but they had

852
01:06:57,950 --> 01:07:01,419
Relatively objective observers also Gathered data at the same time

853
01:07:02,360 --> 01:07:08,319
High-dose psilocybin produced large decreases in Clinician and self related measures of depressed mood and anxiety

854
01:07:08,660 --> 01:07:12,519
along with increases in quality of Life life meaning and Optimism and

855
01:07:13,310 --> 01:07:15,310
decreases in death anxiety

856
01:07:15,410 --> 01:07:17,919
That's interesting. It's a subtle and

857
01:07:19,040 --> 01:07:21,669
Scientifically Sparse statement, but it's a very interesting one

858
01:07:23,540 --> 01:07:24,980
it was the in

859
01:07:24,980 --> 01:07:31,330
there's a there's an intimation of a causal relationship here increases in quality of Life life meaning and

860
01:07:31,820 --> 01:07:33,820
decreases in death anxiety

861
01:07:36,230 --> 01:07:41,199
I mean the intimation there is that one of the ways of decreasing your anxiety about death is to increase the

862
01:07:41,780 --> 01:07:44,629
felt meaning in your life and the psilocybin

863
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:51,559
Dosages potentiate that but it's a good thing to know in a general manner if it happens to be a generalizable truth

864
01:07:51,560 --> 01:07:53,560
right if you're terrified of mortality

865
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:55,860
terrified of vulnerability

866
01:07:55,860 --> 01:08:02,719
there's always the possibility that the life path that you're following isn't rich enough to buffer you against the

867
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:04,620
negative

868
01:08:04,620 --> 01:08:05,910
element of

869
01:08:05,910 --> 01:08:10,520
Existence. It's a reasonable hypothesis and an optimistic one

870
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:13,070
I think although a difficult one that six-month follow-up

871
01:08:13,070 --> 01:08:20,450
these changes were sustained with about 80% of participants continuing to show clinically significant decreases in depressed mood and

872
01:08:20,700 --> 01:08:22,700
anxiety

873
01:08:23,580 --> 01:08:25,310
Steven Ross commenting about this

874
01:08:25,310 --> 01:08:28,160
He was a co-investigator said it is simply unprecedented in

875
01:08:28,350 --> 01:08:32,569
Psychiatry that a single dose of a medicine produces these kinds of dramatic and enduring results

876
01:08:33,270 --> 01:08:35,839
Right which means we have no idea

877
01:08:36,660 --> 01:08:38,660
Why this happens

878
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:46,120
participants attributed improvements in attitudes about life/self mood relationships and

879
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:51,480
spirituality to the High-dose experience with more than 80% endorsing

880
01:08:52,020 --> 01:08:54,560
Moderately or greater increased well-being in life satisfaction

881
01:08:55,350 --> 01:08:57,680
Community Observers showed corresponding changes

882
01:08:58,799 --> 01:09:02,479
mystical types psilocybin experience on session day

883
01:09:03,120 --> 01:09:07,220
Mediated the effect of psilocybin dose on therapeutic outcomes. What that means is that

884
01:09:08,069 --> 01:09:09,450
well

885
01:09:09,450 --> 01:09:14,539
When researchers were trying to look at a causal relationship between drug ingestion and the positive outcome

886
01:09:15,569 --> 01:09:23,569
The causal relationship was drug ingestion mystical experience positive outcome it wasn't drug ingestion positive outcome there had to be the experience

887
01:09:23,790 --> 01:09:31,459
Produced by the pharmaceutical agent in order for the pharmaceutical agent to have had its effect now. We don't again

888
01:09:31,460 --> 01:09:32,730
We don't know why that is either?

889
01:09:32,730 --> 01:09:39,020
Maybe some people needed a higher dose who knows because people vary tremendously in their sensitivity to pharmaceutical substances

890
01:09:39,630 --> 01:09:45,980
Now why am I telling you all this well? I'm telling you for a variety of reasons one is the first is

891
01:09:46,740 --> 01:09:48,740
Make no mistake about it

892
01:09:49,020 --> 01:09:56,419
human beings have the capacity for forms of consciousness that are radically unlike our normative forms of consciousness and

893
01:09:57,210 --> 01:10:00,799
the evidence that those alternative forms of consciousness are

894
01:10:01,980 --> 01:10:03,090
purely

895
01:10:03,090 --> 01:10:10,370
Pathological which is the simplest explanation right?  You perturb the system it produces Pathology that's negative that is the simplest explanation

896
01:10:10,710 --> 01:10:12,600
the Evidence for that is

897
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:14,600
weak at Best

898
01:10:14,610 --> 01:10:17,480
Leaving out the bad trip issue which which is non-trivial

899
01:10:18,150 --> 01:10:24,949
the empirical evidence as it accrues in fact seems to suggest that the consequence of mystical

900
01:10:25,170 --> 01:10:29,089
positive mystical experiences associated with psychedelic intake is

901
01:10:29,670 --> 01:10:34,790
overwhelmingly positive even in extreme situations, and you really can't find a more extreme situation than

902
01:10:36,239 --> 01:10:38,239
uncertain Cancer diagnosis with

903
01:10:38,969 --> 01:10:43,099
Concomitant and depression and anxiety like I mean that's not as bad as it gets

904
01:10:43,100 --> 01:10:49,699
But it's kind of in the ballpark and so the fact that even under circumstances like that. There is the overwhelming

905
01:10:50,310 --> 01:10:54,350
Probability that the experience would be positive because that's another thing you wouldn't expect you know

906
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:59,690
Even from some of the earlier earliest discussions about psychedelic use that were put forth by people

907
01:11:00,330 --> 01:11:02,330
including Timothy Leary

908
01:11:02,699 --> 01:11:06,289
Describing the importance of set right so that the early experimenters

909
01:11:07,050 --> 01:11:08,489
noted that

910
01:11:08,489 --> 01:11:10,519
if you had a psychedelic experience

911
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:16,850
and you were in a bad state or in a bad place that that was one of the precursors to a bad trip that the

912
01:11:16,850 --> 01:11:19,249
negative emotion that you entered the

913
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:26,750
experience with could be magnified tremendously by the by the chemical substance and so that it was necessary to

914
01:11:27,239 --> 01:11:31,879
be somewhere safe to be around people that you trust to be in a familiar environment to get all the

915
01:11:32,670 --> 01:11:40,549
Variables that you couldn't control under control, but here is a situation where that isn't what's happening at all because people have this

916
01:11:41,670 --> 01:11:44,960
cancer diagnosis of cancer diagnosis of unspecified outcome

917
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:52,520
And they still the vast majority of them had a positive experience and the positive experience experience had long lasting positive consequences

918
01:11:53,070 --> 01:11:55,070
so

919
01:11:55,290 --> 01:11:57,290
so the case that

920
01:11:57,330 --> 01:12:00,319
the transcendent experience is not real

921
01:12:01,050 --> 01:12:03,000
That's wrong

922
01:12:03,000 --> 01:12:09,920
It's real. now, We don't know what that means because it actually challenges to some degree our concepts of what two dudes real

923
01:12:10,950 --> 01:12:14,210
But it's certainly well within the realm of normative human experience

924
01:12:14,730 --> 01:12:19,489
So it's part of the human capacity and you know there's been other neurological experiments too. There's

925
01:12:20,130 --> 01:12:25,370
there's a researcher Canadian researcher if I remember correctly who invented something he called the God helmet and

926
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:33,259
It used Electromagnetic stimulation brain stimulation to induce mystical experiences now

927
01:12:33,260 --> 01:12:38,210
I don't remember what part of the brain. He was shutting off or activating with that particular Gadget, but

928
01:12:39,690 --> 01:12:43,069
And you know there's also. There's all sorts of other

929
01:12:44,340 --> 01:12:47,569
indications of this sort of thing that have cropped up in other

930
01:12:49,110 --> 01:12:51,290
domains of the Neurological literature for example

931
01:12:52,170 --> 01:12:55,580
It's very common for people who are epileptic to have

932
01:12:56,400 --> 01:12:58,400
religious experiences as

933
01:12:58,410 --> 01:13:04,099
part of the prodrome to the actual seizure that was the case with dostoyevsky for example who had

934
01:13:05,160 --> 01:13:09,349
Incredibly intense religious experiences that would culminate an epileptic seizure

935
01:13:09,350 --> 01:13:15,109
and he said that they were of sufficient quality that he would give up his whole life to have had them and

936
01:13:15,570 --> 01:13:17,570
the funny thing too is that

937
01:13:17,610 --> 01:13:21,770
In my reading of dostoevsky at least is that I think that

938
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:26,270
epileptic seizures and the associated mystical experiences were part of what made him a

939
01:13:27,030 --> 01:13:28,340
Transcendently Brilliant author

940
01:13:28,340 --> 01:13:35,870
I don't think that he would have broken through into the domains of insight that he possessed without those strange neurological experiences

941
01:13:36,450 --> 01:13:41,300
And it was certainly not the case that his epilepsy or the experiences that were associated with it

942
01:13:42,360 --> 01:13:48,680
Produced what you might describe as an impairment in his cognitive functions quite the contrary at least that's how it looks to me

943
01:13:53,099 --> 01:13:55,099
here's another

944
01:13:55,349 --> 01:13:57,290
Here's another something worth considering

945
01:13:57,290 --> 01:14:01,639
And I don't know how important it is but it might be really important it depends on how important

946
01:14:01,639 --> 01:14:05,509
This is something that carl jung said so depends on how important jung is

947
01:14:06,179 --> 01:14:08,179
now freud

948
01:14:08,429 --> 01:14:12,019
Established the field of psychoanalysis and with it

949
01:14:12,690 --> 01:14:14,690
investigation I would say

950
01:14:15,210 --> 01:14:21,080
Rigorous investigation into the contents of the unconscious a modern psychologists and psychiatrists like to

951
01:14:22,530 --> 01:14:26,389
What would you say? denigrate freud, but I think there's a reason for that

952
01:14:26,389 --> 01:14:27,570
I think that freud's

953
01:14:27,570 --> 01:14:34,909
Fundamental insights were so profound and so valuable that they got immediately absorbed into our culture and now they seem self-evident and so that all

954
01:14:34,909 --> 01:14:36,909
That's left of freud is his errors

955
01:14:37,110 --> 01:14:41,150
You know because we believed everything else. We believe all the profound things he discovered

956
01:14:41,190 --> 01:14:46,159
We just take them for granted and so we don't believe the things that he said that weren't quite on the money

957
01:14:46,159 --> 01:14:49,009
And that's all we credit with him with now

958
01:14:49,050 --> 01:14:55,369
But he was certainly the first person who brought up the idea of the unconscious in a in a rigorous manner

959
01:14:55,369 --> 01:15:01,639
And he was the first person to do a rigorous examination of dreams the interpretation of dreams is a great book

960
01:15:01,639 --> 01:15:07,609
it's well worth reading and he was the first person to note that people were in some sense inhabited by

961
01:15:08,340 --> 01:15:12,830
subpersonalities that had a certain degree of autonomy and and and independent life

962
01:15:13,170 --> 01:15:16,580
Brilliant observation the cognitive psychologists haven't caught up with that at all yet

963
01:15:20,460 --> 01:15:27,859
Jung was profoundly affected by freud jung was profoundly affected by Nietzsche and by freud those were his two main intellectual

964
01:15:29,280 --> 01:15:32,090
Influences, I don't think one more than the other

965
01:15:34,830 --> 01:15:36,949
He split with freud on the religious issue

966
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:40,219
That was what caused the disruption in their relationship

967
01:15:40,219 --> 01:15:45,919
And I think it's an extremely interesting historical occurrence and it might be of profound significance

968
01:15:47,099 --> 01:15:53,599
freud believed that the fundamental myths of the human being was the Oedipal myth, and the Eda pole myths

969
01:15:54,420 --> 01:16:00,770
From a broader perspective is a failed hero story, so the Oedipal myth is the myth of a man who?

970
01:16:01,409 --> 01:16:03,769
Develops who grows up, but then

971
01:16:04,469 --> 01:16:05,830
accidentally

972
01:16:05,830 --> 01:16:13,419
becomes too close to his mother sleeps with her. He doesn't know who she is and as a consequence blinds himself and there's a

973
01:16:14,120 --> 01:16:18,939
There's a there's a warning about human development gone wrong in that story

974
01:16:18,940 --> 01:16:23,080
and I think that freud put his finger on it extraordinarily well because

975
01:16:23,540 --> 01:16:30,100
human beings have a very long period Of dependency and one of the things that you do see in clinical practice is that

976
01:16:30,350 --> 01:16:32,859
many People's problems are

977
01:16:34,010 --> 01:16:41,139
Associated with their inability to break free of their family like they're consumed by the family drama right they can't get Beyond

978
01:16:41,140 --> 01:16:43,269
What happened to them in their family?

979
01:16:43,270 --> 01:16:45,910
They're stuck in the past. It's and that's

980
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:51,850
That's equivalent symbolically speaking you might say to the idea of being too close to your mother of

981
01:16:52,370 --> 01:16:54,370
the Boundaries being

982
01:16:54,590 --> 01:16:58,630
Improperly specified and that happens far more often than anyone would like to think

983
01:16:59,900 --> 01:17:02,050
As I said freud thought it was a universal

984
01:17:03,770 --> 01:17:05,210
but Jung

985
01:17:05,210 --> 01:17:11,439
See he had a different idea and his idea was that it wasn't the failed hero story. That was the universal human myth

986
01:17:11,480 --> 01:17:19,089
it was the successful hero story, and that's a big difference like it's seriously a big difference because

987
01:17:20,090 --> 01:17:22,120
the successful Hero's story is

988
01:17:22,670 --> 01:17:26,290
Remembering sleeping beauty you may remember this in the disney movie

989
01:17:26,630 --> 01:17:31,930
The Evil queen traps the prince in a dungeon, and she's not going to let him out till he's old right

990
01:17:31,930 --> 01:17:37,570
And so there's this comical scene where she's down in the dungeon. He's all in chains, and she's laughing at him

991
01:17:38,090 --> 01:17:41,170
telling him what his future is going to be like it's quite evil and

992
01:17:42,230 --> 01:17:43,400
you know she

993
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:49,420
Paints this wonderful picture of him being freed in like 80 years and hobbling out of the castle on his his horse

994
01:17:49,420 --> 01:17:56,020
That's old it can barely stand up in him with Grey hair and you know she and she recites this story of his eventual

995
01:17:56,540 --> 01:18:03,729
Triumphant departure from the castle as a old and decrepit man and she has a great laugh about it, and it's nice

996
01:18:03,730 --> 01:18:08,439
You know it's a real punchy story. It's really something wonderful for children. That's story and

997
01:18:10,730 --> 01:18:12,730
he gets free of the of

998
01:18:13,340 --> 01:18:15,050
the

999
01:18:15,050 --> 01:18:18,729
Shackles and the things that free em are three little female fairies?

1000
01:18:18,730 --> 01:18:26,020
It's the positive aspect of the feminine that frees him from the dungeon, so it's very interesting and very accurate from a psychological perspective

1001
01:18:26,020 --> 01:18:32,379
it's the negative element of the feminine that encapsulates him in the dungeon and suppose development of the feminine would freeze him and

1002
01:18:32,750 --> 01:18:37,119
and then he has a the queen the evil queen is not very happy when he

1003
01:18:37,430 --> 01:18:44,139
Escapes, you may remember that she stands on top of her castle tower and starts to spin off Cosmic Sparks

1004
01:18:44,230 --> 01:18:45,980
I mean, she's quite the creature

1005
01:18:45,980 --> 01:18:52,689
enveloped in flame, and then she turns into a dragon and she then the prince has to fight with her in order to

1006
01:18:53,930 --> 01:18:57,849
Make contact with sleeping beauty and and awaken her from her

1007
01:18:58,520 --> 01:19:02,409
comatose existence as her unconscious existence and

1008
01:19:05,510 --> 01:19:11,409
That's a brilliant, It's a brilliant representation of a successful hero myth. He

1009
01:19:12,710 --> 01:19:14,710
He doesn't end up

1010
01:19:15,140 --> 01:19:21,520
staying in an unholy relationship with his mother let's say he escapes and

1011
01:19:22,250 --> 01:19:26,319
then conquers the worst thing that can be imagined and

1012
01:19:27,050 --> 01:19:34,420
Is Noble by that and not as a consequence, He's able to wake the slumbering feminine from its coma and

1013
01:19:35,420 --> 01:19:36,880
That's a Jungian story

1014
01:19:36,880 --> 01:19:42,520
And that's the story that he juxtaposed against freud see freud thought of religious phenomena

1015
01:19:42,890 --> 01:19:48,550
As part of an occult tide that would be they would drown rational rationality

1016
01:19:48,620 --> 01:19:51,880
that's why freud was so dominant Lee anti-religious and

1017
01:19:52,490 --> 01:19:54,490
Jung thought no

1018
01:19:54,890 --> 01:20:00,039
It's not the case you're throwing the baby out with the bathwater. There's something profound and

1019
01:20:00,890 --> 01:20:05,289
Central to the Hero myth and Jungian Clinical work

1020
01:20:05,930 --> 01:20:09,700
is essentially the awakening of the hero myth in the

1021
01:20:11,090 --> 01:20:14,469
analysand in the in the client or in the patient to

1022
01:20:14,720 --> 01:20:21,010
conceptualize yourself as that which can confront Chaos and triumph and that that's associated with an

1023
01:20:21,290 --> 01:20:25,030
ennobling of the of consciousness and the establishment of

1024
01:20:25,940 --> 01:20:29,199
proper positive relationships between male and female and

1025
01:20:30,890 --> 01:20:32,890
You know I'm a skeptical person

1026
01:20:33,310 --> 01:20:35,830
I'm a very very skeptical person and I've

1027
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:40,089
Tried with every trick. I have to put a

1028
01:20:40,640 --> 01:20:46,780
Lever underneath Jung story and lift it up and and disrupt it and I I can't do it I

1029
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:50,920
Think he was right and that freud was wrong. I mean I have great respect for freud

1030
01:20:50,920 --> 01:20:56,440
I think he got the program problem diagnosed very very nicely and in my clinical work I

1031
01:20:56,720 --> 01:21:03,220
See the phenomena that freud described emerged continually constantly that the best if you're interested in that

1032
01:21:03,530 --> 01:21:06,069
There's a documentary you should watch. I may have mentioned it before

1033
01:21:06,070 --> 01:21:09,220
I think it's the best documentary ever made certainly the best one

1034
01:21:09,220 --> 01:21:11,220
I've ever seen it's called crumb

1035
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:18,790
And it's about an underground cartoonist Robert crumb who who is part of a hippie movement and although he hated hippies

1036
01:21:19,430 --> 01:21:24,399
He was part of the hippie movement in the 60s in San Francisco and started the entire underground comic

1037
01:21:25,700 --> 01:21:29,109
What? culture that manifested itself eventually in in

1038
01:21:29,780 --> 01:21:31,780
graphic novels, there's quite a

1039
01:21:32,120 --> 01:21:33,530
significant figure

1040
01:21:33,530 --> 01:21:38,079
from the perspective of popular art and a very very intelligent man and

1041
01:21:38,300 --> 01:21:42,909
Also, I would say a hero although a very bent and depraved and warped one

1042
01:21:43,670 --> 01:21:51,370
Someone very acutely aware of his own shadow and the documentary outlines his attempts to escape from his

1043
01:21:52,010 --> 01:21:54,010
absolutely dreadful mother and

1044
01:21:54,590 --> 01:21:57,520
The failure of his two brothers to do the same thing

1045
01:21:57,620 --> 01:21:58,520
one of whom

1046
01:21:58,520 --> 01:22:04,479
Ended up as a street beggar in San Francisco the other who drank furniture polish and died six months after the documentary was produced

1047
01:22:04,730 --> 01:22:06,730
It's an unbelievably shocking

1048
01:22:07,250 --> 01:22:09,250
documentary it's the only piece of

1049
01:22:10,340 --> 01:22:13,630
Film that I've ever seen that captures

1050
01:22:14,300 --> 01:22:19,509
Freudian Pathology I've never seen anything because you can't see it. Generally unless you're in a clinical

1051
01:22:20,120 --> 01:22:25,809
Situation unless you know the details of someone's lives the personal intimate details you cannot communicate it

1052
01:22:26,000 --> 01:22:27,590
but the

1053
01:22:27,590 --> 01:22:29,000
documentarist who made the film

1054
01:22:29,000 --> 01:22:35,169
Who's Robert zwigoff if I remember correctly was a friend of the crumbs and so he got access in a way that no one else?

1055
01:22:35,170 --> 01:22:39,609
Would have and they were also very forthright and forthcoming about their situation in general

1056
01:22:39,610 --> 01:22:45,460
I would highly recommend that it's it's a real punch if you want to know how a rapist thinks

1057
01:22:46,040 --> 01:22:51,309
Like if actually want to know because maybe you don't want to know in fact you probably don't want to know

1058
01:22:52,190 --> 01:22:54,190
Right because do you really want to know that?

1059
01:22:54,590 --> 01:23:00,849
Because the understand that means to put yourself in that position and to understand it if you really want to know how a serial sexual

1060
01:23:01,070 --> 01:23:05,289
Predator thinks and why if you watch crumb and you pay attention?

1061
01:23:06,020 --> 01:23:07,820
you'll know and

1062
01:23:07,820 --> 01:23:12,309
That's only a tiny bit of what the film has to offer. It's really quite remarkable

1063
01:23:14,599 --> 01:23:16,599
anyways

1064
01:23:18,949 --> 01:23:22,029
Jung split with freud on the issue of

1065
01:23:23,539 --> 01:23:29,709
Beautiful story as the fundamental myth of humankind and on the issue of the validity

1066
01:23:30,559 --> 01:23:32,679
of the religious Viewpoint and

1067
01:23:33,170 --> 01:23:39,849
Jung came down heavily on the side of the validity of the religious Viewpoint and he established that in a book called symbols of

1068
01:23:40,159 --> 01:23:45,339
Transformation which was written in 1914 and that's the book that broke that produced the break

1069
01:23:45,559 --> 01:23:48,339
permanent split with freud and that book I

1070
01:23:49,070 --> 01:23:52,000
Would say that books actually been written three times

1071
01:23:53,179 --> 01:23:56,979
it was written as symbols of four times written in symbols of transformation which jung

1072
01:23:57,200 --> 01:24:04,260
extensively revised when he was all and then it was rewritten in his innocence by a student of Jung's called

1073
01:24:04,260 --> 01:24:10,560
Erich Neumann who is also something someone I would really recommend Erich Neumann I think is Jung's greatest student and

1074
01:24:12,100 --> 01:24:15,560
He wrote two books. He wrote one called the origins and history of consciousness

1075
01:24:15,650 --> 01:24:19,719
Which is a description of the development of consciousness out of unconsciousness

1076
01:24:20,630 --> 01:24:24,849
Using the hero myth as a...

1077
01:24:24,849 --> 01:24:31,209
what would you say? as a as an interpretive Skeleton, so Neumann viewed the hero myth as

1078
01:24:31,760 --> 01:24:36,520
The dramatized story of the emergence of human consciousness out of the surrounding

1079
01:24:36,949 --> 01:24:43,719
Unconsciousness in which it was embedded the struggle for consciousness the struggle of consciousness upward towards the light like a lotus flower

1080
01:24:44,030 --> 01:24:49,210
Struggles up through the muck and and the water to to lay itself on the surface of the

1081
01:24:49,309 --> 01:24:55,268
Water and bloom and reveal the Buddha which is of course what the lotus flower does from the symbolic perspective?

1082
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,889
for Neumann

1083
01:24:57,889 --> 01:25:03,039
The Hero's story was the story of the development success development of consciousness and the origins of consciousness

1084
01:25:03,710 --> 01:25:06,129
The origins and history of consciousness is a great book

1085
01:25:07,130 --> 01:25:08,630
interestingly

1086
01:25:08,630 --> 01:25:10,750
Camille Paglia wrote read

1087
01:25:11,719 --> 01:25:14,439
The origins and history of consciousness. She's one of the few

1088
01:25:15,469 --> 01:25:22,689
Mainstream intellectuals that I've ever encountered who read that and commented on it and she believed that it would be sufficient

1089
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:30,580
antidote to postmodern denigration of literature, she thought it was that powerful of work and I

1090
01:25:32,119 --> 01:25:34,329
Believe that I I think it's a remarkable

1091
01:25:34,969 --> 01:25:40,899
Book carl jung wrote the foreword to that book and he said in the foreword that it was the book that he wished he would

1092
01:25:40,900 --> 01:25:44,679
Have written so sort of like Jung he. Wrote I don't remember how many volumes

1093
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:50,949
dozens of very thick difficult volumes was like Neumann was able to

1094
01:25:53,270 --> 01:25:56,020
What? Distill those into a single

1095
01:25:56,449 --> 01:25:57,670
volume statement

1096
01:25:57,670 --> 01:26:02,859
And so I would also say if you're interested in Jung the best book to read is the origins and history of consciousness

1097
01:26:02,860 --> 01:26:07,659
It's the best intro into into the Jungian world seems very difficult to

1098
01:26:08,869 --> 01:26:15,069
very difficult to understand it requires a real shift of perspective in order to understand what he's talking about and

1099
01:26:16,219 --> 01:26:18,219
Neumann wrote another book called the great mother

1100
01:26:18,860 --> 01:26:22,029
Which is a little bit more specialized in some sense

1101
01:26:22,030 --> 01:26:26,920
but it's also extremely interesting because it flashes out the archetype of Chaos and

1102
01:26:27,530 --> 01:26:31,389
It's representation as feminine. It's a brilliant book as well, and

1103
01:26:32,210 --> 01:26:34,569
highly worth Highly worth reading both those books

1104
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:38,320
anyways

1105
01:26:38,750 --> 01:26:42,100
Young was a very strange person and a visionary and and

1106
01:26:42,679 --> 01:26:44,799
So he that's kept him outside of

1107
01:26:45,320 --> 01:26:51,580
The academic realm almost entirely I mean I was constantly warned as an undergraduate, and then a graduate student and then a professor

1108
01:26:52,460 --> 01:26:56,679
against ever talking about jung in any way whatsoever

1109
01:26:57,350 --> 01:27:01,449
When I went on the job market when I was at McGill when I had graduated from McGill

1110
01:27:01,610 --> 01:27:06,520
I'd done my scientific research in alcoholism, and I had a fairly Lengthy publication record

1111
01:27:06,520 --> 01:27:09,969
That was pure empirical research and really neural

1112
01:27:10,670 --> 01:27:12,560
physiological research

1113
01:27:12,560 --> 01:27:15,680
into the pharmacology of alcoholism and I

1114
01:27:16,350 --> 01:27:18,800
established a reasonably solid

1115
01:27:19,920 --> 01:27:21,200
dossier of publications

1116
01:27:21,200 --> 01:27:27,110
but at the same time I was writing this book that became maps of meaning and sorry split my time and graduate student school between

1117
01:27:27,110 --> 01:27:29,299
these two endeavors one very

1118
01:27:30,120 --> 01:27:35,660
Specifically neurological and pharmacological and really biologically based on the other very

1119
01:27:36,450 --> 01:27:39,200
Abstract religious symbolic psychoanalytic

1120
01:27:39,900 --> 01:27:42,679
The complete opposite, but I could see that the two things

1121
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:45,440
overlapped really nicely and there was a number of

1122
01:27:46,080 --> 01:27:48,620
Scientists at the time that were also drawing the same

1123
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:50,940
conclusions the same

1124
01:27:50,940 --> 01:27:58,730
Relationship between the biology and the psychoanalysis jacques panksepp who wrote a book called effective neuroscience which is a great classic is

1125
01:27:59,220 --> 01:28:01,369
one of those people who who saw the

1126
01:28:02,100 --> 01:28:06,950
relationship between the Neurobiology of emotion and motivation and the psychoanalytic insights

1127
01:28:07,890 --> 01:28:10,760
Never became a mainstream view but I think it's too complex

1128
01:28:10,760 --> 01:28:17,300
I think that bridging the gap between the biology and and the symbolic is too much for people generally speaking

1129
01:28:17,300 --> 01:28:22,790
You know it was certainly virtually too much for me because I got quite ill when I was a graduate student I think

1130
01:28:22,980 --> 01:28:24,260
for a variety of reasons

1131
01:28:24,260 --> 01:28:28,429
I also like with glug party three nights a week, and so that probably had something to do with it, but

1132
01:28:30,600 --> 01:28:35,270
But working on those two things simultaneously was also rather exhausting now

1133
01:28:36,000 --> 01:28:37,110
Jung

1134
01:28:37,110 --> 01:28:39,799
Was a tremendously insightful clinician

1135
01:28:39,800 --> 01:28:42,020
And he was a strange person introverted visionary

1136
01:28:42,480 --> 01:28:50,449
High in introversion very very very very very high in openness like off-the-charts and also God only knows what his IQ was I mean

1137
01:28:50,610 --> 01:28:52,670
Every time I read you it's like reading Nietzsche

1138
01:28:52,670 --> 01:28:57,319
It's terrifying because you know he's so damn smart that he can think up

1139
01:28:57,480 --> 01:29:03,980
Answers to questions that you don't even it's not like you don't understand the answers they never conceptualized the damn questions

1140
01:29:03,980 --> 01:29:07,520
It's really something to read someone like that right who says well

1141
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:13,969
Here's the mystery and you think wow I never thought of that as a mystery and here's the solution. It's like okay. That's that's

1142
01:29:15,040 --> 01:29:18,060
That's something you know and he could read Greek and he could read

1143
01:29:19,510 --> 01:29:26,369
He read all the ancient... He read a very large variety of ancient languages and was very familiar with the entire corpus of

1144
01:29:27,730 --> 01:29:30,930
astrological thought and of alchemical thought and of

1145
01:29:32,050 --> 01:29:39,839
classic literature and biblical stories, and I mean educated in a way that no one is educated now and

1146
01:29:40,540 --> 01:29:47,519
So he's very daunting person to encounter and terrifying absolutely terrifying his book ion

1147
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:49,520
which is the second volume of

1148
01:29:50,260 --> 01:29:55,320
it's the second volume of Volume 9 which is the archetypes of the collective unconscious that damn book is just

1149
01:29:55,540 --> 01:29:59,189
Absolutely terrifying because jung is one of these visionaries who can see?

1150
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:05,370
Way underneath the social structures and look at patterns that are developing across for in Jung's case across

1151
01:30:05,560 --> 01:30:13,050
Thousands of years and lays them out and so that's a really that's really something to to encounter ion is a terrifying book

1152
01:30:15,130 --> 01:30:17,020
anyways one

1153
01:30:17,020 --> 01:30:21,600
Question might be well because I read Jung and I think how the hell did he know these things how could he figure these things?

1154
01:30:21,600 --> 01:30:24,990
Out I can't understand how he could possibly know these things

1155
01:30:26,020 --> 01:30:28,020
Well, here's a partial answer

1156
01:30:29,380 --> 01:30:31,060
Jung

1157
01:30:31,060 --> 01:30:38,310
Was a visionary and so what that means as far as I can tell and like we could do a little quick survey here

1158
01:30:38,310 --> 01:30:40,310
How many of you think you think in words?

1159
01:30:41,350 --> 01:30:43,350
Put up your hands. Do you think in words?

1160
01:30:44,980 --> 01:30:48,240
Ok so it looks like what about pictures. How many of you think in pictures?

1161
01:30:49,960 --> 01:30:54,990
Ok so that's interesting how many of you think that's about half and half by the way probably a few err on the word side

1162
01:30:54,990 --> 01:30:56,990
How many of you think in pictures and words?

1163
01:30:58,300 --> 01:31:02,039
Ok and so alright, so it was Roughly 1/3 in each category

1164
01:31:02,040 --> 01:31:06,570
But that's also something that I really haven't encountered any research on

1165
01:31:07,270 --> 01:31:09,720
from the neuropsychological perspective, it's like

1166
01:31:10,390 --> 01:31:15,149
Well, do you think in pictures or do you think in words and and is that actually a reliable distinction?

1167
01:31:15,150 --> 01:31:17,150
I think I think in words

1168
01:31:17,530 --> 01:31:22,649
Most of the time, but I can think in pictures like if I'm trying to build something I can think in pictures very

1169
01:31:23,200 --> 01:31:26,399
Almost instantaneously, but it isn't my natural mode of thinking

1170
01:31:26,500 --> 01:31:30,700
I'm hyper verbal and so my natural mode of thinking is to think everything through in words

1171
01:31:31,070 --> 01:31:36,999
But I know my wife isn't like that. She thinks and images and then has to translate them into words and so

1172
01:31:37,910 --> 01:31:41,170
Anyways, you was very literate, and he could really think in words

1173
01:31:41,170 --> 01:31:46,929
but he could really think in images also talking to my wife quite extensively like her the

1174
01:31:47,570 --> 01:31:50,979
intensity of her visualization vastly exceeds mine

1175
01:31:51,050 --> 01:31:54,849
So for example if I close my eyes and then try to imagine the crowd in front of me

1176
01:31:54,850 --> 01:32:02,170
it's pretty low resolution and vague and not brilliantly colored and vivid you know it's it's it's

1177
01:32:02,390 --> 01:32:05,140
Like I'm seeing through a glass darkly. Let's say

1178
01:32:05,140 --> 01:32:08,559
I can't bring images to mind with that with spectacular clarity

1179
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:12,100
but my wife is very good at that and you seem to be absolutely a

1180
01:32:13,880 --> 01:32:18,519
Genius at that kind of thinking and he had a lot of visionaries in his family history as well

1181
01:32:18,520 --> 01:32:21,910
So I don't know to what degree there's a hereditary component of that

1182
01:32:21,910 --> 01:32:27,550
And I don't know to what degree that's actually like a neurological specialization. I presume it would be associated with

1183
01:32:28,940 --> 01:32:30,940
the trait Openness

1184
01:32:31,310 --> 01:32:35,530
Distinguishes itself differentiates itself into interesting ideas and interest in aesthetics

1185
01:32:35,530 --> 01:32:41,800
And my suspicion are is that the people who are more interested in aesthetics are the visionary types the ones that think in images.

1186
01:32:41,990 --> 01:32:45,099
Anyways Jung could really think in images and he could imagine

1187
01:32:45,890 --> 01:32:51,309
beings and I had a client once who was a lucid dreamer and

1188
01:32:51,950 --> 01:32:56,110
How many of you had lucid dream? So you know you're dreaming? Well you well you're okay many

1189
01:32:56,510 --> 01:33:03,760
That's that phenomena wasn't really even even identified as a phenomena until the end of the 19th century

1190
01:33:03,760 --> 01:33:05,300
There was a book written about it that

1191
01:33:05,300 --> 01:33:10,719
freud tried to get his hands on but couldn't because it was a very rare book and then there was a

1192
01:33:11,180 --> 01:33:14,019
researcher about 30 years ago who started to study lucid dreams

1193
01:33:14,030 --> 01:33:18,940
But anyways, I had a client who was a lucid dreamer and one of the things she could do was

1194
01:33:19,580 --> 01:33:22,180
Ask her dream characters what

1195
01:33:22,850 --> 01:33:26,289
Information they were trying to convey and they would tell her.

1196
01:33:26,870 --> 01:33:34,360
So that was very interesting; and one of the consequences of that was I don't have this story completely right in my memory

1197
01:33:34,360 --> 01:33:35,990
But it's close enough

1198
01:33:35,990 --> 01:33:42,019
She was afraid of a very large number of things and in her dream. I think it was a gypsy

1199
01:33:42,630 --> 01:33:49,279
Standing by a wagon told her that if she was going to be successful in university

1200
01:33:49,710 --> 01:33:53,029
that she would have to visit the slaughterhouse and

1201
01:33:53,730 --> 01:33:58,520
That was something that was way beyond her capacity of tolerate she was a vegetarian

1202
01:33:58,560 --> 01:34:01,939
she couldn't stand the sight of raw meat even and so and

1203
01:34:02,369 --> 01:34:09,709
She was very oppressed and depressed and anxious because of the slaughterhouse nature of existence and so her dream

1204
01:34:09,900 --> 01:34:11,900
focused on that and

1205
01:34:12,210 --> 01:34:17,689
One of the consequences of that because the slaughterhouse was out of the question as a clinical intervention

1206
01:34:18,300 --> 01:34:19,380
I

1207
01:34:19,380 --> 01:34:21,380
Took her to an embalming

1208
01:34:22,440 --> 01:34:25,339
Right because because I asked her I asked her what what?

1209
01:34:26,219 --> 01:34:33,709
What might be equivalent to that and so she suggested that and you know exposure therapy is a hallmark of Clinical psychology?

1210
01:34:33,710 --> 01:34:38,779
right one of the things you do with people as a clinician is you find out what they're afraid of and

1211
01:34:39,239 --> 01:34:45,709
You gradually and voluntarily expose them to that and that cures them and that's associated with the hero myth, right?

1212
01:34:45,710 --> 01:34:48,290
It's exactly the same thing. It's like. There's a dragon

1213
01:34:48,690 --> 01:34:53,179
It's stopping you because there's lots of dragons most of them aren't stopping you. You can ignore them

1214
01:34:53,179 --> 01:34:56,899
You don't have to just go you know slash away it randomly

1215
01:34:57,060 --> 01:35:01,249
You're not supposed to be fighting dragons that aren't in your way, but if they are in your way

1216
01:35:01,250 --> 01:35:04,129
You can't ignore them and then you decompose them into sub dragons

1217
01:35:04,130 --> 01:35:08,210
And you have people you know take them on and as they take them on

1218
01:35:08,550 --> 01:35:12,320
They dispense with the dragon and they gain the power of the drag. It's like a video game

1219
01:35:13,199 --> 01:35:17,839
Actually a video game is like that. That's why people like the video games. Well, that's right, right?

1220
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:23,810
There's a reason that you absorb power when you overcome things when you play a video game. It's not like that's

1221
01:35:24,360 --> 01:35:27,349
Intrinsic to the video game structure, that's an archetypal idea

1222
01:35:27,960 --> 01:35:30,739
Anyways, we went and saw an embalmbng which was a very interesting

1223
01:35:32,489 --> 01:35:34,489
experience and

1224
01:35:34,860 --> 01:35:35,909
and

1225
01:35:35,909 --> 01:35:42,078
quite quite useful for her because she knew what she could tolerate after that and it was a hell of a lot more than she

1226
01:35:42,079 --> 01:35:44,869
Thought she could tolerate and so that's very useful to know

1227
01:35:46,619 --> 01:35:48,469
Back to Jung

1228
01:35:48,469 --> 01:35:56,198
He's a visionary thinker now my client. I said she could lucid dream, and she could ask her dream

1229
01:35:57,050 --> 01:35:58,340
characters

1230
01:35:58,340 --> 01:36:02,679
What they wanted and what they were trying to communicate to her so that was pretty interesting

1231
01:36:02,960 --> 01:36:05,349
That happens spontaneously had nothing to do with me

1232
01:36:05,530 --> 01:36:09,280
I mean, I'm interested in dreams and many of my clients are great dreamers

1233
01:36:09,280 --> 01:36:14,500
Especially the creative ones because I think it's a hallmark of creativity to have vivid dreams and to be able to remember them

1234
01:36:14,989 --> 01:36:19,178
But that was a faculty that was natural to her

1235
01:36:20,929 --> 01:36:22,820
Jung

1236
01:36:22,820 --> 01:36:25,119
Had this other client at One time at one point

1237
01:36:25,849 --> 01:36:28,449
And she had a variety of fears and she had this dream that

1238
01:36:29,150 --> 01:36:31,480
She told me and she was walking down a beach

1239
01:36:32,270 --> 01:36:35,559
And on the side of the beach up a dune a small dune

1240
01:36:35,869 --> 01:36:40,419
there was this old man with a snake a big python, and there's a crowd around him and

1241
01:36:41,780 --> 01:36:43,780
she was walking by the

1242
01:36:43,969 --> 01:36:47,828
Snake handler and the snake in the crowd and she didn't want to have anything to do with them

1243
01:36:47,829 --> 01:36:49,829
he was sort of showing people the snake and

1244
01:36:50,389 --> 01:36:54,519
She told me that dream, and I thought well. You know you probably need to go see that snake

1245
01:36:55,489 --> 01:36:57,139
and so I

1246
01:36:57,139 --> 01:37:00,759
Relaxed hers quasi hypnotic technique, and it's very straightforward

1247
01:37:01,940 --> 01:37:03,940
Hypnosis is generally nothing but

1248
01:37:04,250 --> 01:37:09,489
pronounced relaxation well you have to be susceptible to hypnosis to actually fall into a hypnotic trance as a

1249
01:37:09,590 --> 01:37:12,159
Consequence of being relaxed I just relaxed her

1250
01:37:12,159 --> 01:37:17,049
I had her breathe deeply and pay attention to different parts of her body and just relax her muscles

1251
01:37:17,329 --> 01:37:22,808
One by one essentially so that she could concentrate and then I told her we play with the dream a little bit

1252
01:37:23,570 --> 01:37:29,860
It's a Jungian technique said well, so call the dream image to mind which she could do quite well said okay

1253
01:37:29,860 --> 01:37:33,549
So let's let's explore it. It's like pretend. It's like pretend play

1254
01:37:34,099 --> 01:37:41,078
You know if you're a kid in your pretend playing you don't exactly direct the game right you you play the game?

1255
01:37:41,389 --> 01:37:45,098
So it's partly your direction obviously because you're the player

1256
01:37:45,099 --> 01:37:47,059
But the thing also happens spontaneously

1257
01:37:47,059 --> 01:37:53,288
Out of its own accord and you can think about that as a dialogue between the conscious mind in the unconscious mind in some sense

1258
01:37:53,289 --> 01:37:58,509
It's a developmental dialogue. It's not a fun game. If you just direct it. It's only a fun game if

1259
01:37:59,030 --> 01:38:03,780
you're inviting and something is well as a consequence the same thing that happens when you're

1260
01:38:04,420 --> 01:38:09,119
You're engaged in some kind of artistic or literary production if it's all top down

1261
01:38:09,489 --> 01:38:12,598
You know if you're forcing it then it's Propaganda

1262
01:38:12,599 --> 01:38:17,699
It's empty what you want to sort of put yourself in a receptive state of mind in an imaginative state of mind

1263
01:38:17,699 --> 01:38:19,859
And it's sort of half you in half

1264
01:38:20,980 --> 01:38:22,570
Nature itself

1265
01:38:22,570 --> 01:38:29,219
Manifesting itself in your creative imagination, and that was the sort of state that we were striving for, and she, I

1266
01:38:30,520 --> 01:38:35,069
Asked her when she was in relaxed. I said well, what do you think about the snake handler and she said well?

1267
01:38:35,070 --> 01:38:40,049
He's probably a Charlatan and he's just their turn to impress the crowd and to show off and she was afraid to go up there

1268
01:38:40,050 --> 01:38:43,320
Because she thought people would push her towards the snake and she'd have to touch it

1269
01:38:43,320 --> 01:38:48,719
And so there was a fear of the crowd issue going on there too, and I said well, just look go up there

1270
01:38:49,750 --> 01:38:53,699
About do it under these conditions. Is that you know if people get pushy

1271
01:38:53,699 --> 01:38:56,729
What are you going to tell them and so we figured out something said look?

1272
01:38:57,340 --> 01:38:59,080
Just tell them that

1273
01:38:59,080 --> 01:39:00,250
You know you want to

1274
01:39:00,250 --> 01:39:05,790
look at the snake at your own pace and that you don't need any encouragement or help and it would be good if you

1275
01:39:05,980 --> 01:39:08,759
Were just left alone so that enabled her to defend yourself

1276
01:39:08,820 --> 01:39:11,909
so she was afraid that the crowd would push her to do something that

1277
01:39:12,010 --> 01:39:14,880
She didn't want to do that was part of the theme of the dream

1278
01:39:15,040 --> 01:39:15,810
So anyway

1279
01:39:15,810 --> 01:39:16,239
she

1280
01:39:16,239 --> 01:39:18,159
Eventually climbed the dune in her imagination

1281
01:39:18,159 --> 01:39:22,529
And went into the crowd and the crowd turned out to be quite welcoming and not hostile and not pushy

1282
01:39:22,690 --> 01:39:27,029
Which isn't what you'd expect right because the you'd think the crowd would have,

1283
01:39:27,730 --> 01:39:34,139
Reacted in accordance with her fears since it was her fantasy, but that's the thing about fantasies. They have this autonomous quality

1284
01:39:34,389 --> 01:39:39,449
But the crowd was welcoming and not hostile and it turned out that the snake handler wasn't a Charlatan

1285
01:39:39,820 --> 01:39:42,659
He was just an old guy who had this snake and he was out there

1286
01:39:42,880 --> 01:39:46,589
just showing it to people because he thought it was a cool thing and and

1287
01:39:46,929 --> 01:39:52,469
And that maybe it was good for people to come and look at a snake and so she got close enough to the snake to

1288
01:39:52,469 --> 01:39:54,219
touch it and so

1289
01:39:54,219 --> 01:39:59,279
So I'm telling you that because I want you to understand a bit more about what jung was trying to do and so

1290
01:39:59,590 --> 01:40:01,590
He wrote these books

1291
01:40:02,739 --> 01:40:07,859
notebooks that haven't been published yet called the black books and the black books are the

1292
01:40:08,349 --> 01:40:10,769
documentation of his experiments with his imagination

1293
01:40:11,320 --> 01:40:12,670
and

1294
01:40:12,670 --> 01:40:18,840
What he would do is he dream like a child daydreams. He regained that faculty although

1295
01:40:18,840 --> 01:40:21,569
I think with Jung it was a faculty that had never really disappeared and

1296
01:40:22,900 --> 01:40:28,139
he had figures of imagination that came to him that he could speak with and

1297
01:40:28,420 --> 01:40:35,819
He spoke with these figures of imagination and documented that over a very long period of time, and that was originally that was

1298
01:40:36,340 --> 01:40:38,340
eventually

1299
01:40:39,550 --> 01:40:44,489
Distilled into a book called the red book which was published about three or four years ago

1300
01:40:44,490 --> 01:40:47,760
and it was a book that jung regarded as the

1301
01:40:49,660 --> 01:40:52,740
Central source from which all his inspiration

1302
01:40:53,710 --> 01:40:55,390
emerged

1303
01:40:55,390 --> 01:40:58,320
it was sort of the way it looks to me is that

1304
01:40:59,410 --> 01:41:04,860
we embody a lot of information in our action right and our action has

1305
01:41:05,500 --> 01:41:11,070
Developed as a consequence of imitating other people and not only the people the people around us

1306
01:41:11,070 --> 01:41:16,650
But of course the people around us imitated the people who came before them and those people imitated the people who came before them

1307
01:41:16,650 --> 01:41:24,239
And so on so far back that it's as far back as you can go and so you embody these patterns of behavior that are

1308
01:41:24,430 --> 01:41:31,139
Extremely informative that you don't understand that are a consequence of collective imitation across the centuries and so then those

1309
01:41:31,240 --> 01:41:37,349
patterns can become manifest as figures of the imagination and those figures of

1310
01:41:37,780 --> 01:41:41,280
imagination are the distillation of patterns of behavior and

1311
01:41:42,220 --> 01:41:43,540
so as

1312
01:41:43,540 --> 01:41:51,240
The distillation of patterns of behavior they have content and it's not you that content. It's you could even think about it as content

1313
01:41:51,240 --> 01:41:52,380
That's evolves although

1314
01:41:52,380 --> 01:41:54,100
It's culturally transmitted this

1315
01:41:54,100 --> 01:42:00,809
content that's evolved and so these figures of the imagination can reveal the structure of reality to you and

1316
01:42:01,330 --> 01:42:06,120
That's what happened with jung, and that's what he described in the red book, and that was what permeated his

1317
01:42:06,970 --> 01:42:08,650
psychology, A

1318
01:42:08,650 --> 01:42:10,650
Psychology that was based on the presupposition

1319
01:42:11,050 --> 01:42:16,769
That the fundamental archetypal structures of religious belief were not

1320
01:42:17,380 --> 01:42:19,859
pathological not deceitful not

1321
01:42:20,680 --> 01:42:27,420
Protective in some delusional sense against the fear of death, but quite the contrary the very stories that in

1322
01:42:27,930 --> 01:42:30,479
enabled us to move forward as

1323
01:42:31,210 --> 01:42:34,770
confident human beings in the face of Chaos itself

1324
01:42:35,950 --> 01:42:39,539
And it's conceivable. I think perhaps probable

1325
01:42:40,810 --> 01:42:42,810
That nothing more important

1326
01:42:43,420 --> 01:42:47,219
Conceptually happened in the 20th century than that

1327
01:42:48,190 --> 01:42:50,190
Because it was the first time

1328
01:42:50,440 --> 01:42:52,300
post enlightenment

1329
01:42:52,300 --> 01:42:54,300
that a rapprochement between

1330
01:42:54,640 --> 01:42:56,640
the intellect and the underlying

1331
01:42:57,430 --> 01:42:59,430
religious archetypal sub structure

1332
01:42:59,890 --> 01:43:06,390
Occurred you have in the capacious intellect of young the same thing happened to some degree with Piaget

1333
01:43:07,030 --> 01:43:10,949
the religious domain and the factual domain were brought back together and

1334
01:43:12,460 --> 01:43:15,060
the fact of Jung's enduring and

1335
01:43:15,790 --> 01:43:20,729
Increasing popularity and influence, I would say is a direct consequence of that now

1336
01:43:23,980 --> 01:43:26,880
some of his work was spun off into the new age and

1337
01:43:27,550 --> 01:43:31,380
And the new age is a very optimistic and naive movement

1338
01:43:31,510 --> 01:43:36,780
It's predicated on the idea that you can do nothing say, but follow your bliss and that will take you

1339
01:43:37,450 --> 01:43:41,970
Ever higher to enlightenment, and that's not the Jungian idea at all

1340
01:43:43,180 --> 01:43:45,180
the Jungian idea is that

1341
01:43:46,000 --> 01:43:49,320
What you most need will be found where you least want to look

1342
01:43:50,470 --> 01:43:52,410
So there's this story king arthur

1343
01:43:52,410 --> 01:43:58,079
There's this story of king arthur that they're all in a round table right king arthur and his knights. They're all equals. They're all

1344
01:43:58,630 --> 01:44:02,189
superordinate, but they're all equals and they go off to look for the holy Grail and

1345
01:44:02,740 --> 01:44:08,610
The holy Grail is the container of the redemptive substance whatever that is

1346
01:44:09,460 --> 01:44:13,650
It might be the cup that christ used at the last supper might be

1347
01:44:14,320 --> 01:44:20,429
Chalice that was used to capture his blood on the cross right when he was pierced by a sword the stories differ

1348
01:44:20,500 --> 01:44:22,950
But that's the holy grail and the holy grail is lost

1349
01:44:22,950 --> 01:44:28,320
that's the redemptive substance and the knights of king arthur go off to search for the holy Grail and

1350
01:44:28,420 --> 01:44:30,220
But they don't know where to look

1351
01:44:30,220 --> 01:44:34,260
So where do you look when you don't know where to look for something you need?

1352
01:44:35,260 --> 01:44:36,760
desperately

1353
01:44:36,760 --> 01:44:38,530
But have lost

1354
01:44:38,530 --> 01:44:42,749
well each of the knights goes into the forest at the point of the Darkest to him and

1355
01:44:43,870 --> 01:44:46,289
That's Jungian psychoanalysis in a nutshell

1356
01:44:47,140 --> 01:44:54,269
It's like that which you fear and avoid that's what you hold in contempt that which disgusts you and that you avoid

1357
01:44:54,880 --> 01:44:57,269
That's the Gateway to what you need to know

1358
01:44:58,330 --> 01:45:01,229
There's nothing new age about that. That's for sure

1359
01:45:03,010 --> 01:45:10,079
Now Jung when he started this endeavor, He started with this this is part of the notebooks from the black book he said

1360
01:45:12,100 --> 01:45:14,100
He wrote my soul

1361
01:45:14,140 --> 01:45:19,829
For my soul. Where are you? Do you hear me? I speak I call you are you there?

1362
01:45:20,680 --> 01:45:22,680
I've returned I'm

1363
01:45:22,780 --> 01:45:29,189
Here again, I've Shaken the dust of all the lands from my feet, and I've come to you. I am with you

1364
01:45:29,920 --> 01:45:32,549
After long years of long wandering I have come to you again

1365
01:45:35,890 --> 01:45:37,890
for the Jungians the

1366
01:45:37,930 --> 01:45:41,760
Hero's journey is a journey within and and I think that that's probably

1367
01:45:42,850 --> 01:45:44,020
the

1368
01:45:44,020 --> 01:45:49,170
Bias of introverts to believe that the Hero's journey isn't only an inward Journey

1369
01:45:49,170 --> 01:45:55,799
I think that it can be an outward journey too because I don't think it matters where you confront the unknown whether it's within or

1370
01:45:56,800 --> 01:46:01,679
Without what matters is whether or not you confront the unknown. That's what matters

1371
01:46:07,300 --> 01:46:09,479
But he found that what he had ignored

1372
01:46:10,810 --> 01:46:15,720
Was an undiscovered part of himself so that might be something that was equivalent to huxley's

1373
01:46:16,660 --> 01:46:19,160
Notion that there were tremendous

1374
01:46:19,440 --> 01:46:25,340
Tremendous Potential breath in the realm of human Conscious experience and Huxley was influenced to some degree by Jung

1375
01:46:26,160 --> 01:46:32,960
now Jung knew of Huxley's experiments and had commented on psychedelic use and he said something like

1376
01:46:33,580 --> 01:46:35,880
Beware of wisdom you did not earn and

1377
01:46:37,210 --> 01:46:44,010
Jung was very good at stating things very profoundly very simply and that's a very intelligent piece of advice Beware of

1378
01:46:44,560 --> 01:46:46,560
Wisdom you did not earn he wrote a paper

1379
01:46:47,170 --> 01:46:53,729
If you're interested in this sort of thing he wrote a paper be called the relations between the ego and the unconscious

1380
01:46:53,890 --> 01:46:59,639
Which is an absolute masterwork, but completely incomprehensible unless you know what it unless you know what it's about

1381
01:46:59,639 --> 01:47:04,439
And what it's about is the danger of what he called ego inflation

1382
01:47:04,440 --> 01:47:08,429
And so one of the things that can happen as a consequence of a revelatory experience is

1383
01:47:09,159 --> 01:47:11,159
that the

1384
01:47:11,170 --> 01:47:16,349
Division between the individual ego and and and what would you call it?

1385
01:47:16,989 --> 01:47:18,989
So hard to come up with a word that isn't

1386
01:47:19,659 --> 01:47:21,659
somehow naive or

1387
01:47:21,790 --> 01:47:23,790
or cliched

1388
01:47:24,610 --> 01:47:31,290
To erase the relationship the boundary between the specific consciousness of the ego and the more generalized

1389
01:47:32,139 --> 01:47:33,340
consciousness

1390
01:47:33,340 --> 01:47:36,480
And more generalized consciousness as such is

1391
01:47:37,119 --> 01:47:44,339
A dangerous thing to do because you can start to equate yourself your specific self with that more generalized

1392
01:47:45,010 --> 01:47:51,030
consciousness as such and Jung thought about that is it something akin to a psychotic inflation and

1393
01:47:51,820 --> 01:47:59,579
the paper relations between the ego and the unconscious is a document that tells you how to avoid that if you're

1394
01:48:02,650 --> 01:48:04,650
playing in this kind of realm and

1395
01:48:05,770 --> 01:48:07,360
one of the

1396
01:48:07,360 --> 01:48:09,659
Injunctions is to keep your feet on the ground

1397
01:48:10,840 --> 01:48:16,079
He thought that was what partly what happened to Nietzsche was that Nietzsche wasn't grounded enough in life

1398
01:48:16,079 --> 01:48:22,649
He wasn't grounded enough in Day-To-day rituals and routines and the mundane now you could debate whether or not

1399
01:48:22,650 --> 01:48:27,389
That's the case whether or not that's a reasonable argument, but that was still what Jung believed

1400
01:48:28,869 --> 01:48:30,869
Okay, so why am I telling you all this?

1401
01:48:33,219 --> 01:48:38,129
I'll finish with this from December 1913 onward jung carried on in the same procedure

1402
01:48:38,829 --> 01:48:41,249
Deliberately evoke a fantasy in a waking state

1403
01:48:41,250 --> 01:48:47,790
And then entering into it as a drama these fantasies may be understood as a type of dramatized thinking in pictorial form in

1404
01:48:48,460 --> 01:48:53,669
Retrospect he recalled that his scientific question was to see what took place when he switched off consciousness

1405
01:48:54,579 --> 01:48:56,579
the example of dreams indicated the

1406
01:48:56,650 --> 01:48:58,320
existence of background activity

1407
01:48:58,320 --> 01:49:05,219
And he wanted to give this a possibility of emerging just as one does when taking mescaline. These journals are jung's contemporary?

1408
01:49:05,590 --> 01:49:13,410
Contemporaneous clinical ledger to his most difficult experiment or what later describes as a voyage of discovery to the other pole of the world?

1409
01:49:14,140 --> 01:49:16,169
You'll believe that we were dreaming all the time

1410
01:49:16,960 --> 01:49:22,800
but that during waking life the pressure of external images was such that the

1411
01:49:23,830 --> 01:49:30,570
Unconscious fantasy imagery was or that the fantasy imagery was of insufficient magnitude to be conscious

1412
01:49:30,570 --> 01:49:34,199
But that we were always situated in a dream in relationship to the world

1413
01:49:35,020 --> 01:49:37,020
so

1414
01:49:44,140 --> 01:49:46,140
When we started talking about

1415
01:49:47,650 --> 01:49:55,469
The creation of the universe at the beginning of the genesis stories, I spent quite a long time setting the stage for the stories because

1416
01:49:56,650 --> 01:50:01,139
There's no point in having a conversation about the God who gives rise to being

1417
01:50:01,690 --> 01:50:07,380
Unless you have some sense of what that might conceivably mean to the modern mind, and I felt the same way about

1418
01:50:08,590 --> 01:50:11,849
the Abrahamic stories is I couldn't get a handle on them

1419
01:50:12,670 --> 01:50:15,780
Until I could understand and articulate more clearly

1420
01:50:16,480 --> 01:50:18,370
What it might mean?

1421
01:50:18,370 --> 01:50:21,390
how a modern person might understand a

1422
01:50:23,380 --> 01:50:26,369
direct experience of God in the first question would be

1423
01:50:27,130 --> 01:50:30,839
is such a thing possible and the answer to that seems to be a

1424
01:50:31,780 --> 01:50:35,729
Qualified yes, first of all it's a universal human experience. That's a very strange thing

1425
01:50:36,130 --> 01:50:43,589
It's not something that people have made up as freud might have it as a defense against death. It's not a tenable hypothesis

1426
01:50:43,590 --> 01:50:49,709
it's a realm of potential experience now that experience doesn't necessarily have to have the

1427
01:50:50,230 --> 01:50:53,669
Judeo-Christian content that we've been discussing quite the contrary there are

1428
01:50:54,460 --> 01:51:00,360
Manifestations of this these alternative forms of consciousness all over the world that take on their own peculiar forms although

1429
01:51:00,360 --> 01:51:01,620
They're patterned to some degree

1430
01:51:01,620 --> 01:51:07,169
that's like the hero myth for example of myth of the fight against the dragon seems to be unbelievably widespread and

1431
01:51:07,420 --> 01:51:09,420
So it's not as if it's random

1432
01:51:13,120 --> 01:51:15,180
Sorry, I should just see what time it is here

1433
01:51:21,750 --> 01:51:26,149
But there's not much point in having a discussion about what happens to abraham

1434
01:51:26,820 --> 01:51:32,779
Unless you can conceptualize it in terms that are amenable to modern skeptical consciousness

1435
01:51:32,880 --> 01:51:34,880
So we can establish the proposition that

1436
01:51:35,429 --> 01:51:37,340
Mystical experience is not only possible It's quite common

1437
01:51:38,160 --> 01:51:45,760
and It's inducible in a variety of ways and the manner in which it's inducible is reliable and there's no evidence as well that it's pathological

1438
01:51:45,989 --> 01:51:51,829
In fact there's a fair bit of evidence that the patterns of behavior that are associated with the mystical experience are

1439
01:51:52,080 --> 01:51:55,069
core elements of proper Human adaptation in the world

1440
01:52:19,239 --> 01:52:26,158
The abrahamic stories open up with a manifest God now I'm going to read you some things from Friedman who wrote the disappearance of God

1441
01:52:28,059 --> 01:52:33,059
He was trying to look at the underlying structure of the stories now. You know Friedman noted that

1442
01:52:33,909 --> 01:52:36,689
The books in the old testament were written by a lot of different people

1443
01:52:37,389 --> 01:52:44,969
At very different times and then they were sequenced by other people for reasons that we don't exactly understand

1444
01:52:46,270 --> 01:52:48,929
But there's still an underlying narrative

1445
01:52:48,929 --> 01:52:56,069
There's multiple underlying narrative unities despite the fact of that rather arbitrary sequencing, and that's a strange thing

1446
01:52:56,710 --> 01:52:58,710
You know I guess you could say

1447
01:52:58,809 --> 01:53:03,659
If you had a collection of ancient books and you were trying to put them together you'd try to put them together in some way

1448
01:53:03,659 --> 01:53:05,349
that made sense

1449
01:53:05,349 --> 01:53:11,609
right and it wouldn't make sense unless you stumbled across some kind of underlying narrative that allowed you to order them and

1450
01:53:11,920 --> 01:53:17,040
So it's not entirely surprising that that they're ordered in a manner that's comprehensible, but

1451
01:53:17,739 --> 01:53:20,549
Friedman's comments on the Underlying narrative structure

1452
01:53:22,030 --> 01:53:23,710
part of it was

1453
01:53:23,710 --> 01:53:29,790
well, we'll go through this the books of the old testament were composed by a great many authors according to both traditional religious views in

1454
01:53:29,790 --> 01:53:35,459
Modern Critical scholarship the phenomenon of the diminishing apparent presence of God across so many stories

1455
01:53:35,710 --> 01:53:39,779
Through so many books by so many authors spread over so many centuries is

1456
01:53:40,270 --> 01:53:43,859
Consistent enough to be striking impressive and ultimately mysterious

1457
01:53:45,760 --> 01:53:48,510
But the hiding of the divine face is only half the story

1458
01:53:48,550 --> 01:53:53,279
There's another development also extending across the course of the entire narrative of the Hebrew Bible

1459
01:53:53,679 --> 01:53:57,598
which we must see before we can appreciate the full force of this phenomena and

1460
01:53:58,000 --> 01:54:02,399
before we can pose a solution to the mystery of this of how this happened gradually from

1461
01:54:02,530 --> 01:54:08,190
Genesis to Ezra and Esther there is a transition from Divine to human responsibility for life on Earth

1462
01:54:09,639 --> 01:54:13,409
the story begins in Genesis with God in complete control of the creation

1463
01:54:13,409 --> 01:54:19,589
But by the end humans have arrived at a stage at which in all apparent ways they have responsibility for the fate of the world

1464
01:54:20,650 --> 01:54:22,650
the first two human beings

1465
01:54:24,099 --> 01:54:31,259
Adam and Eve. Take little responsibility themselves they do not design or build anything when they're embarrassed over there nudity

1466
01:54:31,260 --> 01:54:36,690
They do not make clothes they cover themselves with leaves. It's God who makes their first clothing for them

1467
01:54:38,260 --> 01:54:39,430
Noah

1468
01:54:39,430 --> 01:54:44,039
By no means a fully developed personality Noah is not an everyman either broadly speaking

1469
01:54:44,080 --> 01:54:47,309
He reflects a step Beyond Adam and eve in human character and responsibility

1470
01:54:49,420 --> 01:54:50,620
Abraham

1471
01:54:50,620 --> 01:54:57,030
Beyond the counts of Divine commands that abraham does carry out the narrative also includes a variety of stories in Which abraham

1472
01:54:57,310 --> 01:55:00,930
Acts on his own initiative he divides land with his nephew lot

1473
01:55:00,930 --> 01:55:05,639
He battles kings he takes concubines he argues with his wife Sarah on two occasions

1474
01:55:05,640 --> 01:55:10,470
he tells kings that Sarah is his sister out of fear that they will kill him to get his wife and

1475
01:55:10,630 --> 01:55:15,059
He arranges in son's marriage in the place of the single story of Noah's drunkenness

1476
01:55:15,060 --> 01:55:17,640
There are in the case of Abraham the stories of man's life

1477
01:55:18,520 --> 01:55:22,620
The Abraham section thus develops the personality and character of a man a man

1478
01:55:22,780 --> 01:55:29,340
To a new degree in biblical narrative while picturing in him a new degree of responsibility it is not just that Abraham is kind lured

1479
01:55:29,410 --> 01:55:34,170
Kinder gentler More Intrepid more ethical or a better debater than his ancestor, Noah?

1480
01:55:34,540 --> 01:55:41,460
Rather both the Noah and the Abraham stories are pieces of a development of an increasingly stronger stance of humans relative to the deity

1481
01:55:41,710 --> 01:55:46,379
Before the story is over humans will become a great deal stronger and bolder than abraham

1482
01:55:55,170 --> 01:55:57,170
I don't know what that means you know

1483
01:55:59,050 --> 01:56:01,050
see

1484
01:56:01,060 --> 01:56:03,810
It isn't it is certainly the case that

1485
01:56:04,360 --> 01:56:08,460
the individual exists in the Modern world the differentiated

1486
01:56:08,830 --> 01:56:14,759
Self-Aware self conscious individual and it's certainly the case that that wasn't the case at some point in the past and

1487
01:56:14,920 --> 01:56:16,920
So it's the case that there's been a development

1488
01:56:17,020 --> 01:56:19,350
I don't know if you could call it a progression

1489
01:56:19,350 --> 01:56:25,410
But a development of the autonomous individual over some span of historical time now

1490
01:56:25,410 --> 01:56:29,780
We don't know how long that's been but my suspicions are it hasn't been that long

1491
01:56:30,420 --> 01:56:32,420
I mean,

1492
01:56:33,940 --> 01:56:35,940
I read once

1493
01:56:36,429 --> 01:56:44,219
about a neolithic ceremony that involved the particular placement of a bear skull in a cave, and then I read that and

1494
01:56:45,100 --> 01:56:50,069
They had found these placements in caves that were at least 25,000 years old

1495
01:56:50,070 --> 01:56:50,570
And then I read that they found caves in Japan among the Ainu

1496
01:56:50,570 --> 01:56:54,090
who were

1497
01:56:54,219 --> 01:56:59,129
the indigenous inhabitants of Japanese territory and Rather Archaic people who

1498
01:56:59,230 --> 01:57:04,049
Had the same ceremony with the bear and that put the skull in the same orientation

1499
01:57:04,330 --> 01:57:09,899
And place in caves and that that tradition remained unbroken for about 25,000 years

1500
01:57:09,900 --> 01:57:11,190
And you think:

1501
01:57:11,190 --> 01:57:15,060
Well is it possible for an oral or ritual tradition to remain unbroken for?

1502
01:57:15,310 --> 01:57:20,609
Spans of tens of thousands of years and the answer to that is not only is it possible. It's actually the norm

1503
01:57:21,370 --> 01:57:22,900
because like

1504
01:57:22,900 --> 01:57:27,779
One Chimpanzee is like the next chimpanzee right in the in the progression in the biological

1505
01:57:28,060 --> 01:57:33,719
Progression if you took a chimpanzee troop now, and he went back 25,000 years and you looked at a chimpanzee troop

1506
01:57:33,719 --> 01:57:35,879
It'd be the same thing. There's no historical progression

1507
01:57:36,550 --> 01:57:38,940
That's how you can tell the chimps really don't have culture

1508
01:57:39,400 --> 01:57:45,779
Because it's bigger it could even accrete one one thousandth of a percent of culture transmissible culture per generation

1509
01:57:46,270 --> 01:57:48,989
It wouldn't take more than about a million years before

1510
01:57:48,989 --> 01:57:49,989
They'd have a whole civilization

1511
01:57:49,989 --> 01:57:57,839
And they don't they're the same as they were and so the continuity the stability and unchanging nature of the species

1512
01:57:59,350 --> 01:58:03,179
Essentially speaking is the rule that the variant is us

1513
01:58:03,880 --> 01:58:06,390
It's like what the hell happened after the last ice age

1514
01:58:07,030 --> 01:58:09,030
fifteen thousand years ago

1515
01:58:09,030 --> 01:58:11,030
We went from Tribal

1516
01:58:11,320 --> 01:58:16,650
Uniform stable to whatever the hell. We are now it's this transition from

1517
01:58:18,370 --> 01:58:23,400
Generic to specific, it's something like that, and I can't help but think that that's reflective in this text

1518
01:58:23,400 --> 01:58:27,239
and it has something to do with this transition of consciousness from

1519
01:58:28,540 --> 01:58:34,830
From what from possession by the Generic divine to dominance by the specific individual?

1520
01:58:34,840 --> 01:58:37,949
It's something like that. Is that a neurological transformation?

1521
01:58:37,950 --> 01:58:43,829
is that what this is a record of being that we don't know one of the things young said about God because

1522
01:58:44,290 --> 01:58:49,320
Humans relationship with God as an object of belief is very complex

1523
01:58:51,400 --> 01:58:53,040
He in his technical writing

1524
01:58:53,040 --> 01:58:57,000
He always talks about the image of God he never talks about God he talks about the image of God

1525
01:58:57,280 --> 01:59:04,949
He said that the image of God dwells within that's not the same thing as God dwelling within right we could mean all of these

1526
01:59:05,860 --> 01:59:11,819
Capacities that we have for transcended consciousness could be a byproduct of biological evolution they could have no reflection

1527
01:59:11,820 --> 01:59:16,590
They could have no relationship whatsoever to an actual transcendent reality

1528
01:59:16,660 --> 01:59:22,079
There's no way of telling the transcendent reality seems to manifest itself as an element of experience

1529
01:59:22,080 --> 01:59:24,870
But that doesn't mean that it has in reality outside of the subjective

1530
01:59:25,270 --> 01:59:29,219
even if it's even if it exists as it is it clearly does but

1531
01:59:41,080 --> 01:59:47,910
Friedman suggests that what's happening in the biblical narrative is the sequential emergence of the individual as a redemptive?

1532
01:59:48,670 --> 01:59:50,170
Force and

1533
01:59:50,170 --> 01:59:52,409
that the old testament documents that

1534
01:59:53,260 --> 01:59:56,520
implicitly unconsciously as a consequence of

1535
01:59:57,430 --> 02:00:00,750
Descriptive fantasy and that that's what's going on in the book and that

1536
02:00:02,440 --> 02:00:05,250
so the cosmos is under the control of

1537
02:00:06,670 --> 02:00:11,849
Generic Deity to begin with something like that and then that control shifts to

1538
02:00:13,480 --> 02:00:15,480
localized identifiable

1539
02:00:15,880 --> 02:00:18,569
increasingly personal and detailed individuals

1540
02:00:19,630 --> 02:00:24,019
you see that in Noah, and then you see the neighbor ham and then you Moses and

1541
02:00:24,630 --> 02:00:31,730
Then there's this working out of what it would mean to be a fully developed individual, and that's what these stories. They're...

1542
02:00:32,400 --> 02:00:35,660
They're like prototype, they're attempts to...

1543
02:00:36,060 --> 02:00:42,950
To bring about the proper mode of being right and so Abraham is a is a manifestation about because he enters into a covenant with

1544
02:00:42,950 --> 02:00:48,019
God he's selected by God or enters into a partnership with God. It's not exactly obvious. God

1545
02:00:49,110 --> 02:00:52,640
provides him with forward motion and intuition and

1546
02:00:53,640 --> 02:01:00,439
Leads them towards a successful mode of being and it's complex successful mode of being cuz Abraham is a very complex life

1547
02:01:00,440 --> 02:01:03,050
There's plenty of ups and downs right it's it's not

1548
02:01:03,780 --> 02:01:05,780
unbroken

1549
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:07,560
purity of being

1550
02:01:07,560 --> 02:01:14,300
Towards a divine and abraham lies and cheats and deceives and does all sorts of things that that a real person would do and

1551
02:01:14,670 --> 02:01:20,300
And moses for example kills someone and so these people that the biblical people are very

1552
02:01:20,820 --> 02:01:26,479
Genuine individuals, but they're given with all their faults right with all their sins with all their deceit

1553
02:01:26,480 --> 02:01:31,730
They're still put forth as potential modes of proper models of potential

1554
02:01:32,130 --> 02:01:35,150
proper being in the world and the entire corpus of the

1555
02:01:35,850 --> 02:01:40,910
Bible seems to be nothing but an attempt to keep throwing up variants of the

1556
02:01:41,250 --> 02:01:47,209
Personality trying to experiment to find out what personality works in the world

1557
02:01:48,330 --> 02:01:53,840
of course from a Christian perspective that culminates in the figure of christ as the redemptive word and that's

1558
02:01:54,120 --> 02:02:01,999
associated as we've already talked about with the force that brought order out of Chaos at the beginning of time and

1559
02:02:02,970 --> 02:02:04,970
so

1560
02:02:05,640 --> 02:02:07,640
well, that's my attempt to

1561
02:02:08,220 --> 02:02:13,010
provide proper context for the understanding of the abrahamic stories

1562
02:02:13,010 --> 02:02:18,050
And so hopefully with that context we can move forward

1563
02:02:18,750 --> 02:02:20,250
being able to

1564
02:02:20,250 --> 02:02:26,419
swallow the camel so to speak of the initial presence of God in the stories and

1565
02:02:27,210 --> 02:02:30,470
So we'll return to all of that next week

1566
02:02:48,530 --> 02:02:51,429
Let's wait one second. Okay till people

1567
02:02:52,250 --> 02:02:53,560
Have an opportunity to leave

1568
02:02:53,560 --> 02:02:57,100
I would very much like to ask the people who are asking the questions

1569
02:02:57,320 --> 02:03:02,620
To take a few seconds before they ask the question and make sure that the mic is positioned properly

1570
02:03:02,989 --> 02:03:09,279
So that everyone can hear you because people keep writing and complaining that while they're very happy with the questions

1571
02:03:09,280 --> 02:03:14,530
And I would say the questions have been a very high caliber so far, but they're not very happy that they can't hear them

1572
02:03:14,570 --> 02:03:19,929
So I know that you know you're obviously nervous and in a hurry when you want to ask you a question

1573
02:03:19,929 --> 02:03:21,860
but take a second or two to

1574
02:03:21,860 --> 02:03:25,420
Set the mic up properly and make sure that everyone can hear you and so

1575
02:03:26,440 --> 02:03:27,480
Have a way at it.

1576
02:03:27,660 --> 02:03:28,520
"Hello Dr. Peterson"

1577
02:03:28,700 --> 02:03:30,100
Hey, there we go

1578
02:03:30,100 --> 02:03:36,640
"Tonight, I'd like to ask you about two different psychological disorders the first being Borderline personality disorder

1579
02:03:37,060 --> 02:03:39,060
so two lectures ago

1580
02:03:39,710 --> 02:03:43,480
Somebody asks you about it, and you gave a very sparse answer

1581
02:03:43,480 --> 02:03:47,799
I can't remember exactly what you said, but it seemed like it was uh

1582
02:03:48,800 --> 02:03:54,850
It would there was too much complexity to just answer it right there and then and then somebody else also acts

1583
02:03:54,949 --> 02:03:56,949
Asked you about the same disorder in

1584
02:03:57,409 --> 02:04:04,989
your patreon livestream recently and when they when they asked you that you kind of you kind of Stopped for a moment and

1585
02:04:05,510 --> 02:04:08,409
Something I don't know something kind of flicked on in your head

1586
02:04:08,510 --> 02:04:12,159
It seemed like and you and you thought for a couple seconds

1587
02:04:12,159 --> 02:04:14,159
And then you said you know what I don't think

1588
02:04:14,239 --> 02:04:21,369
That I can answer that right now because just - it's just too bloody complex, and I was wondering just like

1589
02:04:22,489 --> 02:04:29,889
Many young men have gravitated towards your lectures. Do you think that there's something about this particular disorder that

1590
02:04:31,670 --> 02:04:37,089
There's something about people with this particular disorder that might gravitate to your insights and your lectures"

1591
02:04:37,730 --> 02:04:44,919
Okay, okay, so now I would say probably no to the second one, but I could comment more about Borderline personality disorder

1592
02:04:44,920 --> 02:04:48,009
I think I have enough mental energy to do that tonight, so

1593
02:04:49,310 --> 02:04:50,900
technically speaking

1594
02:04:50,900 --> 02:04:55,420
It's often considered the female variant of antisocial personality disorder

1595
02:04:56,510 --> 02:04:58,840
So it's it's it's it's classified

1596
02:04:58,880 --> 02:05:05,179
or it's classified in the domain of externalizing disorders acting out disorders and

1597
02:05:05,790 --> 02:05:07,790
I think what happens,

1598
02:05:08,099 --> 02:05:12,709
We don't understand Borderline personality disorder very well, and it's characterized by

1599
02:05:13,800 --> 02:05:15,800
Tremendous impulsivity

1600
02:05:18,810 --> 02:05:20,810
Radical confusion of identity

1601
02:05:21,540 --> 02:05:24,919
and then this pattern of idealization of

1602
02:05:25,739 --> 02:05:27,739
people with whom the

1603
02:05:28,679 --> 02:05:30,679
person afflicted with the disorder is

1604
02:05:31,679 --> 02:05:36,199
Associating with radical idealization of those people and then radical devaluation of them

1605
02:05:36,199 --> 02:05:39,829
and then there's another theme that sort of weaves along with it, which is

1606
02:05:40,380 --> 02:05:42,380
the proclivity of

1607
02:05:42,810 --> 02:05:47,449
people with Borderline personality disorder to presume that they will be abandoned and

1608
02:05:48,060 --> 02:05:52,279
then to act in a manner that makes such abandonment virtually certain and

1609
02:05:53,429 --> 02:05:55,429
So it's a very complicated

1610
02:05:56,400 --> 02:05:58,400
disorder, but that I

1611
02:05:58,800 --> 02:06:00,800
Think gets at the Crux of it

1612
02:06:01,590 --> 02:06:07,310
One of the things that's interesting about people with Borderline personality disorder in my experience. Is that they're often

1613
02:06:08,190 --> 02:06:10,190
quite intelligent and

1614
02:06:11,070 --> 02:06:13,820
You you see in the person with Borderline personality

1615
02:06:14,460 --> 02:06:18,889
Disorder something like the waste or the squandering of tremendous potential

1616
02:06:20,040 --> 02:06:22,040
they seem capable of

1617
02:06:22,590 --> 02:06:24,949
thinking through the Nature of their problems and

1618
02:06:25,530 --> 02:06:30,679
analyzing it and discussing it but not capable whatsoever of implementing any solutions and

1619
02:06:41,530 --> 02:06:45,090
Technically, there's no relationship between IQ and conscientiousness

1620
02:06:46,270 --> 02:06:48,220
It's very weird

1621
02:06:48,220 --> 02:06:51,599
because if you read the neuropsychological literature and you

1622
02:06:52,510 --> 02:06:57,239
Read about the functions of the prefrontal Cortex. They're usually conceptualized in intellectual terms and

1623
02:06:57,940 --> 02:07:01,560
they're associated with planning and strategizing and so forth and

1624
02:07:04,690 --> 02:07:08,819
That's what conscientiousness is is planning and strategizing and implementation?

1625
02:07:08,820 --> 02:07:16,260
But the correlation between IQ and conscientiousness is zero and so as the correlation between working memory and conscientiousness

1626
02:07:16,690 --> 02:07:18,250
zero and Zero

1627
02:07:18,250 --> 02:07:24,899
Is a very low correlation right? I mean really it's hard to find things in psychology that are correlated at zero

1628
02:07:25,900 --> 02:07:28,950
Things tend to be correlated to some degree. They tend to be interrelated

1629
02:07:30,520 --> 02:07:38,069
the Borderline seems to be able to strategize and to abstract but not to be able to implement and

1630
02:07:39,070 --> 02:07:44,130
And so this the intellect per se seems to be functional

1631
02:07:44,130 --> 02:07:47,160
But it's not embodied in action

1632
02:07:48,220 --> 02:07:50,220
It's very so it can be

1633
02:07:50,440 --> 02:07:54,210
frustrating to be associated with someone who has borderline personality disorder because

1634
02:07:54,490 --> 02:08:00,479
They can tell you what the problem is and even tell you what the solution might be but there's no implementation

1635
02:08:03,100 --> 02:08:05,789
So maybe something went wrong developmentally

1636
02:08:05,800 --> 02:08:12,390
We don't know exactly how these sorts of things come about the other thing that seems to be characteristic of Borderline people with Borderline personality

1637
02:08:12,820 --> 02:08:17,640
disorder is that they they remind me very much of people who are 2 years old and

1638
02:08:18,190 --> 02:08:20,190
in some Manner like

1639
02:08:20,680 --> 02:08:22,120
people with Borderline personality

1640
02:08:22,120 --> 02:08:27,629
Disorder can have temper tantrums in fact they often do and we know now and then you see a temper tantrum

1641
02:08:27,629 --> 02:08:33,260
And they're usually thrown by two-year-olds right most people go out of temper tantrums by the time they're about three

1642
02:08:33,360 --> 02:08:39,580
They're very rare at four it. Which is a good thing because if they're still there at four that is not a good diagnostic predictor

1643
02:08:40,200 --> 02:08:44,920
that's a actually good diagnostic predictor, but it's not the kind that you want and

1644
02:08:45,700 --> 02:08:52,259
You know it's funny the way that we respond to two-year-old temper tantrums because the two-Year-old will throw themselves on the ground

1645
02:08:52,710 --> 02:08:57,570
beat their hands and their legs on the floor and scream and yell and turn red or even blue

1646
02:08:57,570 --> 02:09:02,279
I saw a child once who was capable of holding his breath during a temper tantrum until he turned blue

1647
02:09:02,560 --> 02:09:08,519
Which was really an impressive feat you should try that right? It's really hard is you really have to work at it and

1648
02:09:09,430 --> 02:09:15,090
You see that in adult borderlines. They'll have temper tantrums, and the funny thing is when a two-year-old does it it's like

1649
02:09:15,090 --> 02:09:17,020
It's you know, it's little

1650
02:09:17,020 --> 02:09:18,040
off-putting

1651
02:09:18,040 --> 02:09:20,280
but when an adult does it it's

1652
02:09:20,770 --> 02:09:27,450
Completely bloody terrifying and it happens very frequently with borderlines, and so I would also say to some degree

1653
02:09:27,970 --> 02:09:32,880
they didn't get properly socialized between that critical period Of development between two and four and you

1654
02:09:33,190 --> 02:09:36,240
See the same thing with adult males who grow up to the anti-social

1655
02:09:36,610 --> 02:09:43,049
Because a large proportion of adult males who grow up to be antisocial are aggressive as children as two-year-Olds

1656
02:09:43,660 --> 02:09:46,200
So there's a small proportion of two-Year-olds who are quite aggressive

1657
02:09:46,200 --> 02:09:52,019
They'll kick and hit and bite and steal if you put them with other two-year-olds it's about five percent of the of the Male's

1658
02:09:52,270 --> 02:09:56,610
Smaller fraction of the females, but most of them are socialized by the time, they're four

1659
02:09:56,740 --> 02:10:02,880
but there's a small percentage who aren't and they tend to stay antisocial and they tend to turn into long term offenders and

1660
02:10:03,160 --> 02:10:09,510
then attend the devel the critical period for socialization development seems to be between two and four and it seems to be mediated by

1661
02:10:10,180 --> 02:10:15,240
pretend play and Rough-and-Tumble play and those sorts of mechanisms, and if it isn't instantiated by the age of four

1662
02:10:15,970 --> 02:10:21,150
It doesn't happen, and it doesn't look like it's addressable now there are

1663
02:10:22,480 --> 02:10:29,610
dialectic behavioural therapies that have been developed for people with borderline personality disorder, and they're purported to be successful, but

1664
02:10:31,510 --> 02:10:34,380
"Okay, thank you. If I may so the second

1665
02:10:35,140 --> 02:10:37,740
Psychological disorder I want to ask you about is psychopathy

1666
02:10:38,260 --> 02:10:40,260
So you've mentioned that

1667
02:10:40,450 --> 02:10:47,400
Psychopaths tend to switch from dominance Hierarchy to dominance Hierarchy because people get tired of their shenanigans. They have to move on to fresh people

1668
02:10:48,400 --> 02:10:49,630
and

1669
02:10:49,630 --> 02:10:55,650
Psychopaths also tend to be very low in conscientiousness, and you said that when you see some of these protesters

1670
02:10:56,200 --> 02:10:58,030
at your speeches

1671
02:10:58,030 --> 02:11:00,030
some of the men in particular,

1672
02:11:00,220 --> 02:11:01,810
your

1673
02:11:01,810 --> 02:11:09,149
Clinical intuition tells you that there's something seriously pathological about them and I was wondering if you would suspect

1674
02:11:09,489 --> 02:11:11,489
That some of these men might be

1675
02:11:11,619 --> 02:11:16,589
Psychopathic as..." well some of them likely are but I don't know if a higher proportion of the ones who show up at

1676
02:11:16,690 --> 02:11:18,389
Protests and sort of creep me out

1677
02:11:18,389 --> 02:11:23,549
Or I don't know if there's a higher proportion of people like that at the protests or not

1678
02:11:23,550 --> 02:11:24,239
I mean

1679
02:11:24,239 --> 02:11:31,678
I suspect in general that regardless of the protest the proportion of people who have personality disorders among

1680
02:11:31,960 --> 02:11:36,029
Protesters is higher than the proportion of people who have personality disorders in the general

1681
02:11:36,159 --> 02:11:42,239
Population because you just expect that you just expect that kind of acting out behavior. I'm not believe me

1682
02:11:42,239 --> 02:11:46,138
I'm not saying that all protest is associated with personality disorder. I'm not saying that at all

1683
02:11:46,210 --> 02:11:48,070
There's plenty of reason for protest

1684
02:11:48,070 --> 02:11:50,369
But some of the reason for protests are

1685
02:11:50,829 --> 02:11:56,159
Credible reasons and some of them aren't credible reasons that -- "I was just thinking that like the social justice

1686
02:11:56,320 --> 02:11:59,880
Hierarchy so to speak would be one of the last that these

1687
02:12:00,429 --> 02:12:03,719
Confusing--", that's that's that's a different issue. You know there are

1688
02:12:04,869 --> 02:12:09,149
There are analysis of the dangers of agreeableness, so agreeable

1689
02:12:09,150 --> 02:12:12,119
This is a personality trait that underlies the radical

1690
02:12:12,550 --> 02:12:17,460
Egalitarian ethos because agreeable people want everything to be shared equally and it's a good

1691
02:12:17,460 --> 02:12:24,210
I think it's a good ethos for a small group for a family because family is kind of a communist system in some sense

1692
02:12:24,210 --> 02:12:27,719
Right it's like you want the food to be divided up equally among the children

1693
02:12:28,179 --> 02:12:30,989
clearly and you want all the children sort of regardless of their

1694
02:12:31,329 --> 02:12:35,789
Inherent abilities to have the same opportunities and perhaps even the same outcomes

1695
02:12:35,860 --> 02:12:39,869
So I think agreeableness which is associated at least in part with maternal

1696
02:12:40,389 --> 02:12:45,299
Maternal the Maternal Instinct let's say maternal patterns of Behavior. I think it's

1697
02:12:46,059 --> 02:12:48,059
It's a good

1698
02:12:48,250 --> 02:12:49,630
first Pass

1699
02:12:49,630 --> 02:12:55,859
Motivational approximation to a localized familial ethic I think it's a catastrophe at larger scales

1700
02:12:55,860 --> 02:13:00,569
I don't think it scales at all. I actually think that's why we evolved conscientiousness

1701
02:13:01,210 --> 02:13:07,619
Because conscientiousness is the principle that allows larger scale organizations to exist agreeableness won't do it

1702
02:13:08,260 --> 02:13:09,489
now

1703
02:13:09,489 --> 02:13:13,019
Conscientiousness is a mystery right we don't have a neurological model

1704
02:13:13,719 --> 02:13:15,719
We don't have a conceptual model

1705
02:13:15,760 --> 02:13:22,230
We don't have an animal model. We don't have a pharmacological model, and we really only have one way of assessing it which is

1706
02:13:22,960 --> 02:13:25,589
self and other reports of personality proclivity

1707
02:13:26,679 --> 02:13:28,329
so

1708
02:13:28,329 --> 02:13:29,769
anyways

1709
02:13:29,769 --> 02:13:34,739
The problem with agreeableness. This has been modeled a game theorist is that a

1710
02:13:35,679 --> 02:13:40,709
Population of cooperative people can be dominated by a single shark

1711
02:13:42,969 --> 02:13:47,819
So agreeable this is insufficient as a principle because it opens itself up to

1712
02:13:51,840 --> 02:13:53,980
you call that manipulation and

1713
02:13:54,580 --> 02:13:55,620
"infiltration?"

1714
02:13:57,260 --> 02:13:59,260
"I thought that was part of.. [unintelligible]"

1715
02:14:02,040 --> 02:14:08,060
Manipulation let's let's leave it at that to manipulation and and and and exploitation. That's the other thing

1716
02:14:09,070 --> 02:14:10,239
exploitation

1717
02:14:10,240 --> 02:14:12,240
so

1718
02:14:12,820 --> 02:14:14,820
"Thank you"

1719
02:14:18,880 --> 02:14:24,660
"Hi, Dr. Peterson. I had one quick comment and a question so my comment was about your idea of but

1720
02:14:25,269 --> 02:14:31,289
Subpersonalities as one-eyed monsters now. There's the idea of multiple personality or split personality disorder

1721
02:14:31,289 --> 02:14:34,169
It's controversial as to whether or not it exists

1722
02:14:34,170 --> 02:14:40,559
But there's some research recent research that suggests that you may actually have multiple personalities

1723
02:14:41,019 --> 02:14:45,748
That use different parts of the brain so they have differential access to the hippocampus. They have their own memories

1724
02:14:46,840 --> 02:14:48,369
They can

1725
02:14:48,369 --> 02:14:54,779
they use the brain differently, but that seems to be an exaggeration of sub personalities

1726
02:14:55,179 --> 02:14:57,179
Which is quite interesting.

1727
02:14:57,429 --> 02:14:59,429
The question I had was about

1728
02:14:59,800 --> 02:15:01,920
So you talked about Jung and how

1729
02:15:03,699 --> 02:15:07,768
You should confront that which you don't want to confront the most

1730
02:15:07,769 --> 02:15:14,279
so you're most afraid or disgusted by that you've the most resistance to arm, so but we were talking about psychedelics and

1731
02:15:14,590 --> 02:15:16,590
in the experience of hell, so

1732
02:15:17,079 --> 02:15:21,058
at least some of the people I've talked to they describe negative trips as

1733
02:15:21,789 --> 02:15:23,819
an experience of a

1734
02:15:25,360 --> 02:15:27,659
constant fear prolonged fear and

1735
02:15:28,389 --> 02:15:30,099
some of the most

1736
02:15:30,099 --> 02:15:35,819
Dramatic and personalized fear that they've ever experienced; so shouldn't negative on

1737
02:15:36,489 --> 02:15:38,489
psychedelic trips

1738
02:15:38,619 --> 02:15:43,679
Elicit the kind of concentration that Jung thought you should engage them?" Could be.

1739
02:15:44,739 --> 02:15:47,098
Could could well be you know it

1740
02:15:49,090 --> 02:15:51,090
It's conceivable that...

1741
02:15:55,630 --> 02:15:57,630
I read this strange book once that

1742
02:15:58,119 --> 02:16:03,719
made the claim that what was in the ark of the covenant was a mixture that was made from

1743
02:16:04,539 --> 02:16:06,539
Amanita Muscaria mushrooms

1744
02:16:07,400 --> 02:16:09,460
And that's not as far-fetched as you might think

1745
02:16:10,000 --> 02:16:14,460
Because there's a mycologist an amateur mycologist named Gordon Wasson

1746
02:16:15,120 --> 02:16:16,520
who

1747
02:16:16,539 --> 02:16:20,909
Established, credibly, the notion that it was Amanita Muscaria

1748
02:16:21,519 --> 02:16:25,559
potions that was the soma of the Rig veda and

1749
02:16:26,439 --> 02:16:29,159
so it's a strange idea but

1750
02:16:30,550 --> 02:16:35,099
it's not an idea that's completely outside of the realm of possibility and

1751
02:16:37,630 --> 02:16:39,159
the Amanita

1752
02:16:39,159 --> 02:16:46,709
Muscaria is the fly agaric in the red mushroom with white dots, and it's used in shamanic rituals in Cross Asia

1753
02:16:47,260 --> 02:16:48,429
and

1754
02:16:48,429 --> 02:16:52,738
It's apparently not toxic in its dried form although that is not a recommendation

1755
02:16:54,189 --> 02:16:56,908
You know this is serious serious and dangerous

1756
02:16:59,229 --> 02:17:01,229
speculation and material

1757
02:17:01,929 --> 02:17:05,009
One of the things that the priests had to do

1758
02:17:07,029 --> 02:17:12,179
before they commune with what was ever in the ark of the covenant was purify themselves and

1759
02:17:13,239 --> 02:17:15,599
So one possibility is that?

1760
02:17:16,269 --> 02:17:18,040
the bad

1761
02:17:18,040 --> 02:17:20,040
psychedelic experience is a

1762
02:17:21,189 --> 02:17:22,779
Involuntary

1763
02:17:22,779 --> 02:17:25,049
Confrontation with what you would describe as the shadow

1764
02:17:25,719 --> 02:17:27,580
It's like so

1765
02:17:27,580 --> 02:17:29,229
Beware of

1766
02:17:29,229 --> 02:17:31,229
experimenting with

1767
02:17:33,010 --> 02:17:37,559
substances that produce divine revelations if you're in a serious state of disorder

1768
02:17:37,559 --> 02:17:42,539
And I do think that is what happens to people is that they encounter?

1769
02:17:43,960 --> 02:17:46,500
Everything about them that's chaotic and out of place.

1770
02:17:46,500 --> 02:17:52,400
And some people get trapped in that and they can't get beyond it and that's because there's so much of it

1771
02:17:53,040 --> 02:17:55,040
and so

1772
02:17:55,179 --> 02:17:57,179
But we don't know enough to know

1773
02:17:58,689 --> 02:18:00,689
so

1774
02:18:12,790 --> 02:18:16,259
"Citizen Peterson, you son of a bitch

1775
02:18:17,920 --> 02:18:21,750
How are you?" I'm not too bad you got a question?

1776
02:18:24,580 --> 02:18:29,219
"That's the question. No I've got a real question. I got a great question you're going to like this one, okay?

1777
02:18:29,219 --> 02:18:34,829
It's about inspiration because you talk about inspiration quite a bit in this lecture series and also I wanted to point out

1778
02:18:34,960 --> 02:18:36,960
you have a I guess a

1779
02:18:37,300 --> 02:18:43,520
45-minute Armchair discussion, which you have a video of one paragraph of Nietzsche's Beyond good and evil

1780
02:18:43,520 --> 02:18:50,520
You posted and it seems like you're awestruck at the structure and the choices and I guess

1781
02:18:51,220 --> 02:18:55,080
the ideas contained in various layers of this paragraph

1782
02:18:55,080 --> 02:19:00,620
And you're inspired and that inspires you to I guess do your work that you do..?

1783
02:19:01,240 --> 02:19:03,240
I encountered, I guess a similar

1784
02:19:04,360 --> 02:19:10,360
Phenomenon here with one sentence written by the great Joseph Cardinal ratzinger and

1785
02:19:10,960 --> 02:19:18,359
I mean this one sentence answers the question why do people search for God and if you could read it out and then

1786
02:19:18,660 --> 02:19:20,660
Deconstruct it. It's on sentence

1787
02:19:20,700 --> 02:19:23,020
I've copied the original pages

1788
02:19:25,260 --> 02:19:31,400
It's at the end of page 105 if you want to read it from the book or I just--" that's 'the question that

1789
02:19:32,280 --> 02:19:34,640
human existence not only poses

1790
02:19:34,660 --> 02:19:42,539
but itself is the in conclusiveness inherent in it the bounds it comes up against and that yet yearn for the

1791
02:19:42,760 --> 02:19:47,700
Unbounded more or less in the sense of Nietzsche's assertion that all pleasures yearns for eternity

1792
02:19:47,700 --> 02:19:49,740
It experiences itself as a moment

1793
02:19:50,021 --> 02:19:57,360
This simultaneity of being limited and of yearning for the unbounded and open has always prevented man from resting in himself

1794
02:19:57,760 --> 02:19:59,760
Made him sense that he is not

1795
02:20:00,240 --> 02:20:06,920
Self-sufficient, but only comes to himself by going outside himself and moving toward the entirely other and infinitely greater'

1796
02:20:08,320 --> 02:20:10,320
Well, it's a hell of a sentence

1797
02:20:10,840 --> 02:20:16,540
"Like when I read that sentence. I decided I wanted to write like Joseph Cardinal ratzinger

1798
02:20:16,600 --> 02:20:19,860
I had a very similar experience when I watched the Joe Rogan podcast

1799
02:20:20,980 --> 02:20:24,200
877 I said I want to speak like Jordan Peterson

1800
02:20:25,140 --> 02:20:29,060
That's what I wanted to do" so I had this...

1801
02:20:29,060 --> 02:20:33,600
I had this discussion with a patreon supporter this week a young guy

1802
02:20:34,360 --> 02:20:36,360
from Australia and

1803
02:20:36,460 --> 02:20:43,169
He said something very interesting that's related to this and it's a bit. It's something that's very profound. I said I think

1804
02:20:45,610 --> 02:20:53,039
There's this idea in Christianity that we've discussed briefly that the judge and the redeemer are the same figure now

1805
02:20:53,040 --> 02:20:55,709
You know in the book of revelation you may know this and you may not

1806
02:20:56,351 --> 02:20:58,351
Christ comes back as a

1807
02:20:59,230 --> 02:21:04,799
Judge he has a sword coming out.. it's a revelatory vision. Not that that book it's a very strange

1808
02:21:05,891 --> 02:21:11,490
It's the last thing you'd expect conservative Christians to believe and believe me and such a visionary

1809
02:21:12,130 --> 02:21:13,650
hallucination the book of revelation

1810
02:21:13,650 --> 02:21:18,179
but christ comes back with a sword coming out of his mouth and he comes back as a judge and he

1811
02:21:19,090 --> 02:21:23,190
Divides the damned from the redeemed and most are damned and some are redeemed

1812
02:21:23,190 --> 02:21:29,249
It's very very harsh Jung believed that the figure of christ in the gospels was too agreeable

1813
02:21:29,680 --> 02:21:34,470
To merciful to tilted towards mercy and that that called out for a counter

1814
02:21:34,630 --> 02:21:39,089
position and that the counter position of judgment very interesting hypothesis

1815
02:21:39,399 --> 02:21:45,028
But then but then there's this this melding of the two ideas that the judge and the redeemer are the same thing

1816
02:21:46,000 --> 02:21:47,229
Okay

1817
02:21:47,229 --> 02:21:48,520
now

1818
02:21:48,520 --> 02:21:51,720
This young man told me that his life lacked

1819
02:21:52,359 --> 02:21:59,818
Purpose and direction and meaning and that he was nihilistic until he started he read "zen in the art of motorcycle maintenance"

1820
02:22:00,729 --> 02:22:02,490
Which is a book I actually like quite a bit

1821
02:22:02,490 --> 02:22:07,649
I've read it three times at different decades of my life and one of the things that's very interesting about that book is that it's

1822
02:22:07,649 --> 02:22:11,759
an examination of the idea of quality of the idea that there are

1823
02:22:12,160 --> 02:22:19,589
Qualitative distinctions between things and that we have an instinct to make qualitative distinctions and so a qualitative distinction is

1824
02:22:20,300 --> 02:22:23,880
Simply this is better than that which is a judgment

1825
02:22:24,480 --> 02:22:26,480
Okay, now what ratzinger is

1826
02:22:27,960 --> 02:22:29,960
hypothesizing is that

1827
02:22:30,160 --> 02:22:34,919
The person in enough you know how you the idea of the modern idea is you're supposed to accept yourself

1828
02:22:35,040 --> 02:22:42,179
I think that's an insane idea by the way really I think I can't think of a more nihilistic idea than that you're already ok

1829
02:22:42,430 --> 02:22:43,290
It's like no

1830
02:22:43,290 --> 02:22:45,980
You're not and the reason you're not is could you could be way more?

1831
02:22:46,060 --> 02:22:50,560
Than you are so what do you want to be you want to be ok as you are or do you want to strive

1832
02:22:50,860 --> 02:22:52,860
towards what's better? and

1833
02:22:53,229 --> 02:22:55,050
This young man this australian

1834
02:22:55,050 --> 02:22:58,740
he said that the reason that 'zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance' had such a

1835
02:22:59,109 --> 02:23:04,259
Impact on him was because he wasn't happy with his current mode of being right he didn't

1836
02:23:04,779 --> 02:23:07,499
Consider the Manner in which he conducted himself

1837
02:23:08,109 --> 02:23:10,109
sufficient and the fact that

1838
02:23:11,140 --> 02:23:17,100
The author of Zen and, it was Persik laid out the notion that you could make qualitative distinctions,

1839
02:23:17,100 --> 02:23:22,720
And there really was a difference between good things and bad things or great things and evil things, it gives you direction

1840
02:23:23,580 --> 02:23:27,700
it gives you gives you the possibility of moving upward and

1841
02:23:28,540 --> 02:23:31,169
Ratzinger is pointing out at least to some degree that

1842
02:23:31,510 --> 02:23:36,630
Human beings are insufficient in and of themselves and need the movement upward and so they need to

1843
02:23:36,850 --> 02:23:40,979
conceptualize something like the highest good and then to strive for that and

1844
02:23:41,800 --> 02:23:44,490
The thing is is that there isn't any difference

1845
02:23:45,069 --> 02:23:48,599
between conceptualizing the good and being judged

1846
02:23:49,021 --> 02:23:50,160
because if you're going to

1847
02:23:50,160 --> 02:23:56,180
conceptualize the good and move towards it what you have to do is separate from yourself all those things that aren't good and

1848
02:23:56,400 --> 02:24:00,829
leave them behind and that's where the redeemer and the judge are the same thing and

1849
02:24:01,440 --> 02:24:03,260
One of the things that's really appalling

1850
02:24:03,260 --> 02:24:08,690
I think about our modern world is that we're rejecting the notion of qualitative distinctions

1851
02:24:08,690 --> 02:24:15,020
You say well, we don't want to hurt anybody's feelings by saying that one thing is better than another it's like okay fair enough

1852
02:24:15,020 --> 02:24:20,140
It's not fun to be cast off with the damned. That's for sure

1853
02:24:20,320 --> 02:24:25,120
But if people are in fact insufficient in their present condition

1854
02:24:25,820 --> 02:24:29,280
Which seems to be the case; I mean try finding someone who isn't?

1855
02:24:29,640 --> 02:24:36,700
Then if you deny the possibility of qualitative distinction because you want to promote a radical

1856
02:24:37,050 --> 02:24:43,940
egalitarianism then you remove the possibility of redemption because there's no movement towards the good and it seems to me that it's a

1857
02:24:44,160 --> 02:24:46,789
Catastrophe to sacrifice the good for

1858
02:24:48,391 --> 02:24:55,250
Well, it's a catastrophe to sacrifice the good for the equal; because for us to be equal would be mean as far as I can

1859
02:24:55,250 --> 02:24:58,910
tell that we would all be equally unredeemed and miserable and

1860
02:24:59,460 --> 02:25:01,460
so

1861
02:25:05,280 --> 02:25:08,209
"He also mentioned in the previous paragraph

1862
02:25:08,311 --> 02:25:14,450
I believe that even in the case when you experience the human life at its fullest that it's most

1863
02:25:14,670 --> 02:25:18,350
Beautiful as its most meaningful you have a deep I guess

1864
02:25:19,141 --> 02:25:23,600
Understanding that you have something to be thankful for you need to thank somebody for that

1865
02:25:23,601 --> 02:25:25,851
It's not based entirely on your own merit and that

1866
02:25:26,490 --> 02:25:31,249
Points you towards something else and also, and-" I don't think that you can have a profoundly positive

1867
02:25:32,220 --> 02:25:33,630
experience

1868
02:25:33,630 --> 02:25:36,530
You know in the best sense without that accompanying it

1869
02:25:37,050 --> 02:25:42,080
That's a feeling of being blessed. It's something like that. Yeah. That's a good oh

1870
02:25:43,710 --> 02:25:45,740
Wait hold it. I'm going to stop you

1871
02:25:45,740 --> 02:25:52,159
Okay, because I'm going to ask this person, but I would like to say that those were remarkably good questions

1872
02:25:52,740 --> 02:25:54,740
so

1873
02:26:00,200 --> 02:26:03,009
"Dr. Peterson, thank you for the wonderful lecture

1874
02:26:04,280 --> 02:26:06,339
given your working definition of truth and

1875
02:26:07,250 --> 02:26:13,660
And let's say within the abrahamic religious tradition would you say that the more perhaps

1876
02:26:14,200 --> 02:26:16,200
mystical sects and denominations

1877
02:26:16,600 --> 02:26:19,100
which place more emphasis on the

1878
02:26:20,280 --> 02:26:23,240
transcendental experience of God also on this experience

1879
02:26:24,320 --> 02:26:27,669
as opposed to the more fundamentalist, Orthodox

1880
02:26:28,460 --> 02:26:30,460
literalist which perhaps

1881
02:26:30,620 --> 02:26:32,700
Emphasize that what I've noticed

1882
02:26:35,360 --> 02:26:41,800
Moral policing of behaviors" yeah? "would you say that the former is more true than the latter?" no. "and--"

1883
02:26:42,520 --> 02:26:50,280
no. and and okay, sorry continue. "And B: could the former in some ways serve as an antidote to

1884
02:26:50,500 --> 02:26:52,600
extremists literalism, Jihadism

1885
02:26:53,900 --> 02:26:59,020
Fundamentalism?" okay, so yes to the second part, but the first part it's a great question

1886
02:26:59,271 --> 02:27:03,400
We did some research on this a while back because we're looking at

1887
02:27:04,070 --> 02:27:07,179
the different religious proclivities of liberals and conservatives and

1888
02:27:08,180 --> 02:27:13,180
Liberals like if you're liberal it means you're high in openness and low in conscientiousness, and if you're conservative

1889
02:27:13,180 --> 02:27:19,480
Then you're high and conscientiousness and low and openness and that the liberals are spiritual and the conservatives are dogmatic

1890
02:27:20,210 --> 02:27:22,210
but it's best to think of those as

1891
02:27:23,030 --> 02:27:25,600
partners, right? because the

1892
02:27:26,391 --> 02:27:33,641
spiritual mystical end is where the revelations Emerge and the renewal, but that's where there's Chaos and and

1893
02:27:34,340 --> 02:27:37,810
Discord as well, because what's new disrupts what's stable

1894
02:27:37,811 --> 02:27:39,110
and so

1895
02:27:39,110 --> 02:27:40,880
What's new has to be turned into...

1896
02:27:40,880 --> 02:27:43,210
It has to be integrated into what's stable

1897
02:27:43,210 --> 02:27:47,620
And so you need both those poles and of course if the dogmatists get the upper-hand then everything

1898
02:27:47,840 --> 02:27:54,580
turns into a Tyranny of stone that that's egypt in the old testament, but if the if the if the

1899
02:27:55,340 --> 02:27:59,170
Mystics get the upper hand then everything floats off the earth into some

1900
02:27:59,780 --> 02:28:03,699
impractical ether that is equally counterproductive, and so there has to be a

1901
02:28:04,311 --> 02:28:06,040
dialogue between those different poles

1902
02:28:06,040 --> 02:28:09,339
And I think you see that in the distribution of human temperament

1903
02:28:09,460 --> 02:28:15,790
You know the conscientious types there they tend to be orderly the orderly types tend to tend towards kind of a right-wing

1904
02:28:16,430 --> 02:28:23,260
Totalitarianism that's their proclivity when they when they when things get out of hand especially if they're low in openness, that's a danger

1905
02:28:24,350 --> 02:28:25,910
but

1906
02:28:25,910 --> 02:28:29,499
You see the same thing with the people who are too open and not conscientious at all

1907
02:28:29,540 --> 02:28:35,800
They're dreaming all the time, but they never do anything. There's never anything implemented and that that's bad. That's a bad thing

1908
02:28:36,700 --> 02:28:43,680
So I don't think that you can say that like- the dogmatic structure is necessary because that perpetuates the system and the revelatory

1909
02:28:43,900 --> 02:28:49,700
Element is necessary because that renews it when renewal is necessary and there has to be a continual dialogue between those elements

1910
02:28:50,000 --> 02:28:56,950
So that neither of them fall prey to their own particular form of Pathology that's one of the problems with the current political

1911
02:28:58,250 --> 02:29:00,250
What would you call it?

1912
02:29:00,560 --> 02:29:05,319
Polarization that's occurring across the west is that the right and the left and are talking to each other anymore.

1913
02:29:05,540 --> 02:29:07,749
That's a very bad thing because the left will

1914
02:29:08,390 --> 02:29:11,050
wander into a pit and fail without

1915
02:29:12,439 --> 02:29:18,879
boundaries and the right will enclose itself in smaller and smaller spaces until it can't move without the left and

1916
02:29:19,069 --> 02:29:25,959
One of the reasons that democracy works is because it makes people talk; or allows them to talk you can have it either way

1917
02:29:26,600 --> 02:29:28,600
but it's in its bits because

1918
02:29:29,540 --> 02:29:31,540
Every virtue has its vice

1919
02:29:32,120 --> 02:29:38,679
right and so a meta virtue is something like the amalgamation of singular virtues into something that's a

1920
02:29:39,020 --> 02:29:43,960
Transcendent structure that has more to do with the harmony of virtues rather than with any given virtue

1921
02:29:44,479 --> 02:29:51,969
even though I think that freedom of speech is the clearest manifestation of that harmony of virtues, so and

1922
02:29:52,609 --> 02:29:58,568
"So all could be a lubricant for the beginning of this discussion. Do you think between the liberals and conservatives?"

1923
02:30:04,000 --> 02:30:06,000
I don't know how to answer that

1924
02:30:08,980 --> 02:30:15,660
It doesn't follow immediately from your from your initial presupposition, so the awe experience is a different issue

1925
02:30:15,660 --> 02:30:17,600
"[Unintelligible]"

1926
02:30:17,600 --> 02:30:19,600
Yeah, we'll be able

1927
02:30:20,060 --> 02:30:27,820
Yes, "at least exposing conservatives to some form of that experience could it be if we requisite for a more productive dialogue?"

1928
02:30:31,060 --> 02:30:36,540
See I mean in it in in in the church in church ceremony let's say a classical church ceremony

1929
02:30:36,800 --> 02:30:42,280
There's some intermingling of both right you mean you think about a church ceremony that takes place in the Gothic cathedral

1930
02:30:42,500 --> 02:30:47,500
We've certainly got the dogma and they're under and the relatively rigid rule structure

1931
02:30:47,630 --> 02:30:50,769
but at the same time that's aligned with intense beauty and

1932
02:30:51,170 --> 02:30:55,719
In the architectural forms in the in the light that's streaming in through the stained-glass

1933
02:30:55,970 --> 02:31:03,940
windows and the music and I mean the Gothic cathedrals are forests right it's a stone forest with sunlight streaming in through the Trees and

1934
02:31:04,670 --> 02:31:07,450
It's a balance between structure light there are absolutely

1935
02:31:07,940 --> 02:31:08,980
unbelievable structures

1936
02:31:08,980 --> 02:31:14,379
And they speak of the transcendent but but inside that there's a structure and so it

1937
02:31:14,660 --> 02:31:19,690
Seems that in order for the religious impulse to be balanced properly there has to be a reasonable

1938
02:31:20,930 --> 02:31:28,059
dialogue even in practice between the mystical awe-inspiring transcendent and the dogmatic yeah either of those can

1939
02:31:28,400 --> 02:31:33,159
Can go as either those goes astray without the other if you're too dogmatic. Do you need aw?

1940
02:31:35,090 --> 02:31:41,530
likely yes, because that would show you that there's something beyond your own presuppositions, so

1941
02:31:43,130 --> 02:31:48,370
So awe, I should tell you something interesting about awe as a as a physiological phenomena

1942
02:31:48,370 --> 02:31:50,620
You know how you're listening to music and you get chills?

1943
02:31:51,680 --> 02:31:56,620
Some people experience that more than others open people experience that more or music is a pretty

1944
02:31:58,010 --> 02:32:00,010
reliable

1945
02:32:00,380 --> 02:32:02,240
elicitor of

1946
02:32:02,240 --> 02:32:10,179
Chills, that's piloerection. That's your hair standing on end. You see a cat when it sees a dog puffs up. That's awe

1947
02:32:11,200 --> 02:32:14,980
It's the same thing like that that chill is your hair standing on end

1948
02:32:14,980 --> 02:32:20,900
And that's this that's sensation you get in the presence of a meta predator

1949
02:32:20,908 --> 02:32:23,400
It's something like that and so the awe

1950
02:32:24,010 --> 02:32:25,750
experience is a

1951
02:32:25,750 --> 02:32:31,199
I mean obviously it's become very cognitively and emotionally complex in human beings, but it's fundamental

1952
02:32:31,869 --> 02:32:33,760
evolutionary underpinning is

1953
02:32:33,760 --> 02:32:34,840
the Instantaneous

1954
02:32:34,840 --> 02:32:41,099
piloerection that you see in prey animals when they're confronted by a predator and of course that would be if you are a rabbit

1955
02:32:41,100 --> 02:32:45,420
You can bloody well believe that you see a wolf and it would inspire. Awe that's for sure

1956
02:32:45,420 --> 02:32:51,449
I mean if a wolf that was 20 feet high came bounding in here, man, you'd feel awe so

1957
02:32:52,180 --> 02:32:55,769
Yeah, that will convince you that there's something that you still need to know

1958
02:32:59,170 --> 02:33:00,310
last

1959
02:33:00,310 --> 02:33:02,109
last question

1960
02:33:02,109 --> 02:33:04,379
"Perfect timing. Hi, Dr. Peterson

1961
02:33:04,380 --> 02:33:09,420
My name is Gary, and I'm a clinical and counseling master student right now and so one of the key ideas

1962
02:33:09,540 --> 02:33:11,660
That's been surfacing time and time again in your

1963
02:33:12,300 --> 02:33:14,300
Lectures is the idea that

1964
02:33:14,350 --> 02:33:16,619
Phenomenology is structured and flows

1965
02:33:17,350 --> 02:33:19,350
mythologically and

1966
02:33:20,109 --> 02:33:22,679
the way that plays out is I'm

1967
02:33:23,920 --> 02:33:28,259
supposing effectively just pay attention to what comes up kind of

1968
02:33:28,869 --> 02:33:32,489
naturally and you can locate the chaotic elements in your experience and

1969
02:33:32,920 --> 02:33:37,170
Prod at them with whatever degree of Necessity you think so

1970
02:33:37,930 --> 02:33:39,960
trying to situate this within the clinical

1971
02:33:40,720 --> 02:33:42,720
context

1972
02:33:43,000 --> 02:33:45,000
We can conceptualize

1973
02:33:46,119 --> 02:33:50,459
Psychotherapy as a kind of guided journey just as you touched on in this lecture

1974
02:33:51,460 --> 02:33:56,399
Where it's more of a meta journey in a sense a meta heroic journey if I don't know how you want to think about it

1975
02:33:56,439 --> 02:33:57,790
but

1976
02:33:57,790 --> 02:34:03,359
Just for those of us who are interested in kind of grounding and implementing these ideas within?

1977
02:34:04,060 --> 02:34:05,470
psychotherapeutic practice

1978
02:34:05,470 --> 02:34:08,550
What should we watch out for in the process itself?

1979
02:34:09,159 --> 02:34:15,659
What comes up? What should we be afraid of or fearful of or cautious about or what should we tend towards that's my question"

1980
02:34:17,529 --> 02:34:19,948
Well, I think one of it

1981
02:34:21,369 --> 02:34:24,509
One of the people who I've read that's had the biggest

1982
02:34:25,810 --> 02:34:28,529
Impact on me as a Clinician was carl Rogers

1983
02:34:30,230 --> 02:34:34,760
And the reason for that is that carl Rogers put tremendous emphasis on listening.

1984
02:34:35,400 --> 02:34:42,470
Like it's almost impossible to overestimate how useful it is to listen to your clients like you need a meta

1985
02:34:42,750 --> 02:34:44,750
Scheme in some sense and

1986
02:34:45,000 --> 02:34:50,150
The meta Scheme, I think is laid out in the sermon on the mount. It's something like

1987
02:34:51,330 --> 02:34:53,450
orient yourself and your client

1988
02:34:54,511 --> 02:34:56,511
Towards the good

1989
02:34:56,580 --> 02:35:00,770
The client has to conceptualize what that might be you can serve as a guide

1990
02:35:00,771 --> 02:35:06,650
But it has to come from that person because one of the things that you want to find out from your client is okay

1991
02:35:06,660 --> 02:35:08,370
What's wrong?

1992
02:35:08,370 --> 02:35:10,370
they have to tell you and

1993
02:35:10,771 --> 02:35:18,021
What would not having something wrong look like like what is it if you could have what you wanted and that and that...

1994
02:35:18,330 --> 02:35:23,900
That would be good. What would that look like okay? So that establishes your star, right? It's like Geppetto

1995
02:35:24,511 --> 02:35:28,400
Establishing the relationship with the star at the beginning of pinocchio. Here's what we're aiming at

1996
02:35:28,950 --> 02:35:30,710
Okay, so now you've got that schema

1997
02:35:30,710 --> 02:35:31,771
Here's what we're aiming at

1998
02:35:31,771 --> 02:35:37,700
now you might say you might think well now that what happens to the client is they meet their dragons along the way and

1999
02:35:37,980 --> 02:35:40,159
The dragons would be well now

2000
02:35:40,160 --> 02:35:40,910
You know what you want,

2001
02:35:40,910 --> 02:35:47,209
And there are things in your way and some of those things might many of those things are going to be intensely practical

2002
02:35:47,210 --> 02:35:49,170
But they're practical/

2003
02:35:49,170 --> 02:35:54,140
Psychological so like so maybe someone is has a job and they would like to move forward in the job

2004
02:35:54,141 --> 02:35:56,141
But they're terrified of speaking in public

2005
02:35:56,280 --> 02:35:59,270
Well, you know is that a psychological problem or a practical problem?

2006
02:35:59,880 --> 02:36:00,620
It's both

2007
02:36:00,620 --> 02:36:04,579
It's also a real problem in many positions unless you can speak fluently

2008
02:36:04,860 --> 02:36:09,409
Publicly you're you're going to hit a ceiling and you're not going to go anywhere and so

2009
02:36:10,021 --> 02:36:13,551
For the person to move towards that goal

2010
02:36:14,820 --> 02:36:18,560
Then they have to confront the obstacles that manifest themselves

2011
02:36:18,960 --> 02:36:23,160
Within that framework and part of your job as a clinician is to identify the obstacles

2012
02:36:23,250 --> 02:36:28,459
And to discriminate them from things they don't have to worry about right part of it is

2013
02:36:28,891 --> 02:36:31,341
you know you can't just run around and try to

2014
02:36:31,891 --> 02:36:37,761
Combat all the Chaos in the world some of it is your Chaos and a bunch of it isn't and the Chaos

2015
02:36:37,761 --> 02:36:41,300
That's yours is the Chaos that emerges as you move towards a necessary goal

2016
02:36:41,460 --> 02:36:46,740
And so partly what you're doing by listening to your client is to help them cut their dragons down to size

2017
02:36:46,940 --> 02:36:51,940
You know because what will happen if you start to talk to somebody about public speaking and you really talk to them

2018
02:36:51,940 --> 02:36:57,780
Is that you decompose the problem into a set of maybe 20 subproblems like well

2019
02:36:57,800 --> 02:37:01,250
Do you know exactly how to give a speech? What's your theory of

2020
02:37:02,250 --> 02:37:07,700
Public speaking? Do you know how to look at people when you're talking? Do you know how to speak loudly enough?

2021
02:37:07,700 --> 02:37:10,939
so that people can hear you? do you have a philosophy of

2022
02:37:11,790 --> 02:37:17,660
Public speaking? you know all those things are necessary in order to do it properly you need to decompose that with the client and then to

2023
02:37:17,850 --> 02:37:23,899
Make those problems you have to decompose them to the point where they can be met by a practical solution

2024
02:37:23,910 --> 02:37:28,249
and then you have to guide the person through the implementation of the practical solution and

2025
02:37:30,029 --> 02:37:32,209
Mostly you do that by by listening

2026
02:37:32,520 --> 02:37:36,200
It's like the what you need to be is the person who helps the person

2027
02:37:36,510 --> 02:37:39,380
That you're working with orient themselves towards a better future

2028
02:37:39,590 --> 02:37:44,719
That's the compact you and I are in this space at this time to make things better

2029
02:37:45,840 --> 02:37:48,529
first of all we have to decide what better would look like and

2030
02:37:49,080 --> 02:37:51,439
Second we need a strategy and third

2031
02:37:51,439 --> 02:37:52,200
we need to

2032
02:37:52,200 --> 02:37:55,549
Once we have that we're going to see the obstacles and some of those are going to be

2033
02:37:55,680 --> 02:37:59,180
Psychological and some of them are going to be practical and we're going to engage in joint

2034
02:37:59,790 --> 02:38:02,899
problem-solving of whatever, sort is necessary in order to

2035
02:38:04,529 --> 02:38:10,669
Minimize the impact of those problems or to gain from the problems and dream analysis can be extremely useful for that by the way

2036
02:38:11,010 --> 02:38:17,540
It's even more useful for helping the person identify what the goal is because that's often difficult for people. It's like well

2037
02:38:17,540 --> 02:38:18,529
I know that something's wrong

2038
02:38:18,529 --> 02:38:24,289
But I don't know what I want. sometimes people get so stuck there that they just can't get they just can't get out of it

2039
02:38:25,080 --> 02:38:27,379
So and then what would you watch out for?

2040
02:38:29,279 --> 02:38:33,229
"Phenomenologically. The way it shows up, The way, It's experienced"

2041
02:38:34,560 --> 02:38:38,450
Well, I would say the clinician one of the things that you should watch out for is resentment

2042
02:38:39,300 --> 02:38:43,040
So there's a there's a couple of rules of thumb that I think are useful

2043
02:38:43,200 --> 02:38:47,450
Don't do anything for your clients that they can do for themselves and don't do them any favors?

2044
02:38:48,720 --> 02:38:50,899
Now I think you can step

2045
02:38:51,810 --> 02:38:54,319
Beyond the confines of your role

2046
02:38:55,410 --> 02:38:57,410
carefully now and then

2047
02:38:59,350 --> 02:39:01,180
to show that

2048
02:39:01,180 --> 02:39:07,859
There's there's there's a more human connection than the merely contractual. I think that's very useful but

2049
02:39:09,069 --> 02:39:12,929
Their problems are not your problems you do not have any right to their problems

2050
02:39:12,930 --> 02:39:17,250
And so you have to maintain that detachment because otherwise you can steal their destiny

2051
02:39:17,380 --> 02:39:22,229
You don't want to be the person that solves their problems because you steal their destiny when you do that

2052
02:39:22,359 --> 02:39:26,189
You want to be someone with whom they can figure things out for themselves?

2053
02:39:26,260 --> 02:39:32,550
And so there can be hubris in being a clinician because you can be the problem solver and that elevates you to a position

2054
02:39:32,979 --> 02:39:35,818
You elevate yourself to that position. You'll fall flat on your face

2055
02:39:35,890 --> 02:39:40,920
You'll hurt your clients and things will kick back on you very very hard because what the hell. Do you know?

2056
02:39:41,560 --> 02:39:42,580

2057
02:39:42,580 --> 02:39:49,769

02:39:49,960 --> 02:39:51,960

02:40:16,260 --> 02:40:22,800
