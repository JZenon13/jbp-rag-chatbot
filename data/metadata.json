    "text": "[Music] thank you thank you so I've been thinking about things that I'm happy about and what I'm most happy about so far is that I haven't spilled my my bubbly water into my computer so far while I've been doing these lectures that's always I'll probably do it tonight now that I'm bragging about having avoided it so thank you all for coming this is the last lecture in this 12 part series I did mention that I have made arrangements with the theatre at least to do this once a month for the next four months and we'll see we'll play it by ear past end I want to continue and I'll find another venue and perhaps to do it every two weeks but certainly once a month and maybe I can even get deeper into the material if it's only once a month so that would be then and then we'll really slow down to a snail's crawl yeah so this is a tough one tonight you know it's something a story that everyone with any sense should approach with a substantial degree of trepidation I've been working on my book this week on Chapter 7 which is called do what is meaningful not what's expedient and it's really it's been a very difficult chapter because I'm coming to I'm trying to to extend my understanding of sacrifice which is of course what we're going to talk about tonight in great detail and and I've been wrestling with exactly how to do that and I'm going to read you some of that I think today don't generally read when I do my lectures but this is so complicated that I'm not confident of my ability to just spin it off you know sort of what would you call it spontaneously that's the word and so and it'll also give me a chance to test out whether what I've written which I've been struggling with has the kind of poetic flow that I'd like to have if you're writing it's really good to read things aloud you know because you can tell if you've got the rhythmic cadence right then so so anyways thank you all for coming many of you have I believe attended all 12 lectures and that's really remarkable it's amazing that you know this place has been full every single lecture it's completely unbelievable that would be the case and you know about more than two million views of this is being watched more than two million views it's not 2 million people because it would be the same people I would suspect many times but that's also crazy but it's a crazy world and it seems to keep me getting crazier so hopefully this is some addition to stabilizing it and making it slightly more sane that's the hope anyways so we've got a couple of stories to deal with tonight complex complex stories not really easy to comprehend in any sense of the in sense of the word I mean with the story of Isaac God calls on his his chosen individual Abraham the person who's made this contract with to sacrifice his son and it's how in the world are you supposed to make sensible any sort of sensible sense out of that it's exactly that sort of story that makes modern people who are convinced that the faster we put the biblical stories behind us the better it's it's grist for their mill you know because it seems like such a incomprehensible and even barbaric act on the part of God and so you know I hesitate to even approach it because well because there's so many ways that the an interpretation of that sort can go wrong but we'll see how it goes and so let's walk through it and see what happens so we start with the story of Sarah and Isaac and the Lord visited Sarah as he had said you remember when Abraham was in the midst of his appropriate sacrificial routines which we've characterized as his return to the contract he made with the idea of the good the contract with God he was informed by God that he would get what he most wanted which was an error and it despite his advanced old age and of course Sarah was very skeptical about that as she had every reason to be but this story opens with with the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham and the Lord visited Sarah as he had said and the Lord did unto Sarah as he had spoken for Sarah conceived and bore Abraham a son in his old age at the set time of which God had spoken to him and Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto Him whom Sarah bear to him Isaac and Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old as God commanded him had commanded him and Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born unto him and Sarah said goth had made God had God have made me to laugh so that all that here will laugh with me and she said who would have said unto Abraham that Sarah should have given children suck for I've borne him a son in his old age and the child grew and was weaned and Abraham made a great feast the same day that Isaac was weaned I suppose one of the one of the purposes let's say perhaps the literary purposes of this story is to exaggerate for dramatic purposes the importance of a child you know when people are young and I think this is particularly true in the modern world they seem to often regard the possibility of having a child as an impediment to their lifestyle you know and of course in some ways I suppose that's true although you have to have quite a lifestyle before a child actually constitutes an impediment because having a child in your life is actually something that's remarkable almost beyond belief you know you can have a relationship with a child that is better than any relationship you've ever had with anyone in your life if you're careful and if you're fortunate fortunate being fortunate helps you know I've seen many people delay having children and for understandable reasons it's no simple decision to have a child and of course now we can make the decision to have a child which of course people couldn't in in past ages really but sometimes you see people delay and they delay too long and then they don't get to have a child and then they're desperate and you know they spend a decade doing fertility treatments or that sort of thing and immersing themselves in one disappointment after another and it's just at that point you see exactly how catastrophic it is it can be how catastrophic it can be for people not to have one of the not to be able to undergo one of the great adventures of life let's say and one of the things this story does by by delaying the arrival of Isaac and delaying the arrival of Isaac continually is to exaggerate the the important significance of the child because it is until you're deprived of something it's truly not until you're deprived of something that you have any sense of what its value is and Isaac was waiting or Abraham was waiting a very long time a hundred years a very long time and the same with Sarah and so they're unbelievably excited and of course this also heightens the drama that's inherent in the entire sacrificial story because it's not only that eventually that Abraham is called upon to sacrifice Isaac which would be bad enough under any other any circumstances whatsoever self-evidently but the fact that he's been waiting a century for the arrival of this child desperately and made all the proper sacrifices and lived in the appropriate manner to allow this to occur dramatically heightens the literary tension now you remember Hagar this is the next part of the story Hagar was is was Sarah's handmaid and when Sarah was unable to bear abraham a child she sent him Hagar and Hagar immediately got pregnant and and gave birth to Ishmael and the story picks up from that point here and if this is quite interesting I mentioned the other week when I was talking to you guys a couple of weeks in a row just how interesting it has been to scour the internet for the for the paintings that are associated with these stories there's just a there's an amazing wealth of great paintings that illustrate every single bit of the of every single biblical story and it's it's it's a it's really been enlightening to me to find out just exactly how poorly educated I am you know like I I'm a what would you say I'm I'm a great admirer of artistic talent and of artistic endeavor but there's so much I don't know about the history of art that it's just absolutely beyond belief and to see this treasure trove of images that I really had no idea that existed of course they're spread all over the world and it's only been in recent years that you could have access to them and in this way just it's just it's a it's a it's a constant revelation of the depth to which these stories have absolutely permeated our culture and the loss that it would be if we didn't know them properly and and take them with a degree of seriousness that they deserve so anyways this is one of those great images and Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian which she had born unto Abraham mocking wherefore she said unto Abraham cast out this bondwoman and her son for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with my son even with Isaac and the thing was very Grievous in Abraham's sight because of his son was being quite a bit of tension between Abraham or between Sarah and Hagar as you could imagine there might be why wouldn't there be I mean first of all Hagar had the first child and and that elevated her status and she was Sarah's made handmaiden so that's obviously going to be quite awkward and then she she lorded it over Sarah because of the fact that she got pregnant so easily and now we see this situation where Ishmael is doing the same thing with regards to Isaac and that causes a substantial amount of trouble the family is a familial division occurring here God said unto Abraham let it not be Grievous in thy sight because of the lad and because of the bondwoman in all that Sarah hath said unto thee hearken unto her voice for in Isaac shall thy seed be called and but also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation because he is thy seed that's so that's it that's an interesting outcome to you know we we pointed out before we discussed before the fact that because Abraham has made has lived his life properly and has kept the contract with God there's every evidence in the story that no matter what the vicissitudes of Abraham's life you know how the Great Serpent that he sits on in some sense weaves back and forth there's always the promise that things will work out positively and you know you could read that as naive optimism but I think it has a lot more to do with the actual power of keeping the contractual agreement because I really do believe and I've spent a tremendous amount of time thinking about this over the last couple of weeks in addition to the decades before that is that it and all that's happened since I've been doing these biblical lectures is that my conviction in this is being strengthened which is quite interesting is that if you if you do what it is that you're called upon to do which is to lift your eyes up above the mundane daily selfish impulsive issues that might be set you an attempt to enter into a contractual relationship with that which you might hold in the highest regard whatever that might be to aim high and to and to and to make that important above all else in your life that that fortifies you against the vicissitudes of existence like nothing else can and I truly believe that that's the most practical advice that you can possibly that you could possibly receive you know I received I was answering questions last night I did this Q&A which I do about once a month for for the people who are supporting me on patreon which I also release on YouTube and somebody asked you know they were struggling with their religious faith and they asked what they could do about that and I'd also been thinking about the the difference between Nietzsche and Dostoevsky which I'll discuss in a minute and I was trying to answer this question with regards to religious faith because this person was shaky in his faith in life let's say which is a better way of thinking about it and and it seems to me that the way that you fortify your faith in being and in life and your own existence isn't to try to convince yourself of the existence of a transcendent power that you could believe in the same way that you believe in a set of empirical fact I don't I don't think that's the right approach I think it's a weak approach actually I don't think that the cognitive technology that I don't think that's the right cognitive technology for that set of problems you know that's more technology that you'd use if you're trying to solve a scientific problem it's more like it's more something that needs to be embedded in action rather than in stainable belief and the way that you fortify your faith in life is to assume the best something like that and then to act courageously in relationship to that and and that's that's tantamount to expressing your faith in the highest possible good it's tantamount to expressing your faith in God and it's not a matter of stating well I believe in the existence of a transcendent deity because in some sense who care who cares what you believe I mean you might and all that but but that's not the issue it's not the issue the issue it seems to me is how you act and I was thinking about this intensely when I was thinking about Nietzsche and Dostoyevsky because of course you know that Nietzsche was the philosopher who announced the death of God right and who was a great great critic of Christianity at vicious critic of institutional Christianity in the best sense you know and he announced the death of God and he said that we'd never find enough water to wash away the blood it wasn't a triumphant proclamation even though it's often read that way and don't choose conclusion from that from the death of God the fact that our ethical systems were going to collapse when the foundation was pulled out from underneath them he believed that human beings would have to find their own values to create their own values and there's a problem with that because it doesn't seem that this is something Carl Jung was very thorough in investigating it doesn't really look like people are capable of creating their own values because you're not really capable of molding yourself just any old way you want to be like you have a nature that you have to contend with and so it isn't a matter of creating our own values because we don't have that capacity it might be a matter of rediscovering those values which is what human was attempting to do now and and and so I think Nietzsche was actually profoundly wrong in that in that recommendation I think he was psychologically wrong now you know Dostoevsky wrote in many ways in parallel to Nietzsche was a great influence on Nietzsche their lives parallel each other to a degree that's somewhat miraculous in some sense it's it's quite uncanny Dorothea Eskie was obviously a literary figure whereas nature was a philosopher a literary philosopher but still a philosopher and Dostoyevsky wrestled with exactly the same problems that that Nietzsche wrestled with and but he did it in a different way he didn't literary matter and he has this great book and The Brothers Karamazov and in that book there's a hero of the book is really a lyosha who's a monastic novitiate a very good guy kind of not an intellect not an intellect but a person of great character you know and but he has a brother Ivan who's his older brother who's a great intellect and and a very handsome so a brave man and like Dostoyevsky's villains Ivan isn't exactly a villain but that's close enough Ivan our Dostoevsky makes his villains extraordinarily powerful so if dusty esti is trying to work out an argument he he closed the argument in the in the flesh of one of his characters and if it's an argument he doesn't agree with and he makes that character as strong as he possibly can as strong and as attractive and intelligent as he possibly can and then he lets him just have at her and so Ivan is constantly attacking Elly OSHA and from every direction trying to knock him off his perch of faith let's say and and elosha Alyosha can't address a single one of Ivan's criticisms and and he doesn't have the intellect for it and and and Ivan has a devastating intellect it's devastating to him himself as well what happens in the brothers karamazov essentially is that Alyosha continues to act out his commitment to the good let's say and in that manner he's triumphant it doesn't matter that he loses the arguments because the arguments aren't exactly the point the arguments in some sense are a side issue because the issue is and this is the existential issue the issue is not what you believe as if it's a set of facts but how you conduct yourself in the world and so Dostoyevsky he grasped that and it's one of the things that makes him such a amazing amazing literary figure an amazing genius because he was smart enough to to formulate the arguments in a manner that no one else really could with the possible exception of Nietzsche and that's quite an exception and yet he could still using his dramatic embodiment he could still lay out solutions to the problems that he was describing that are extremely compelling and both crime and punishment which is an amazing thrilling engrossing book and The Brothers Karamazov all of dusty-ass Keys great books really circulate around around those profound moral issues and so I've learned a tremendous amount from reading him so and God said unto Abraham let it not be Grievous in thy sight because of the lad and because of thy bondwoman and all that Sarah hath said unto thee hearken unto her voice for in Isaac for in Isaiah Excel shall thy seed be called and also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation because it as I seed alright so I commented that Abraham is being blessed in multiple directions even when things are going wrong and this is pretty bad because his family in some sense is breaking up the there's this emphasis in the text that because he's kept this contractual relationship with God that that he's in an arc we could say at that we could put it that way and that the that he'll he'll triumph through the vicissitudes of life which is the best you can hope for and it's quite interesting again one of the things that's so powerful about the Abrahamic stories is that it's not like Abraham even though he's chosen by God it's not like he has an easy time of it he has a rough life I mean it's a successful life and all that but it's not it's not it's not it's not without its troubles that's for sure it's got every sort of trouble you could possibly imagine pretty much and and that's one of the things that makes the story so realistic as far as I'm concerned and Abraham rose up early in the morning and took bread and a bottle of water and gave it unto Hagar putting it on her shoulder and the child and sent her away and she departed and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba I found the funny I guess this had more of an emotional impact on me this week than it might have because my daughter just had a baby a week ago and so I've been thinking about this sort of thing know was so happy that that's happened and I was trying to put myself and uh what would you say the conceptual space of the people about who these stories or people who these stories are about and trying to you know notice that the catastrophe that this sort of breakup would actually constitute and you know and the visual images really helped with that because they're they're so carefully crafted and and they hid the story from so many different directions that you know they add that an additional layer of ocean meaning to it which I found very very significant and the water was spent in the bottle and she cast the child under one of the shrubs and she sent to wander in the desert you know so it's not just that she has to leave Abraham's household it's that where she goes is not really amenable to life and so it's it's an extraordinarily dramatic and terrible tale and she went and sat her down over against him a good way off as were a bow shot for she said let me not see the death of the child and she sat over against him and lift up her voice and wept and God heard the voice of the loud and the angel of God called to Hagar out of heaven and said unto her what aileth thee Hagar fear not for God have heard the voice of the lad where he is rise lift up the loud and hold him in 9 hand for I will make him a great nation and God opened her eyes and she saw a well of water and she went and filled the bog with water and gave the lad drink and God was with the lad and he grew and dwelt in the wilderness and became an archer that's actually a relevant detail to the fact that he became an archer because I think I mentioned to you at one point that the word sin is derived from a Greek word amar kiya even though it sounds nothing like that word and Hammar kiya is actually a an archery term and it means - it means to miss the bullseye and that's a that's a lovely metaphor for sin I think because it's associated so tightly with the idea of of goal direction and and aim you know because there's an emetic Oracle idea that's embedded in that in that image and that is that you know a human being is something that specifies a target which we do all the time with their eyes by the way I mean our eyes our target specifying mechanisms you know we have very precise central focal vision and we use our focal vision to target the aim of our behavior and so we are aiming creatures there's our it's built right into our Plouffe or body or we're built on a hunting platform or aiming creatures and we do that cognitively as well as behaviorally and so as hunters we take aim at things that we take aim at moving targets and we're very good at bringing them down and we've been doing that for who knows how long millions of years really even chimpanzees are carnivorous by the way at least but from them about 6 million years ago so we've been hunting and aiming for a very very long period of time and we still have aims in our life right and that's how we describe them what are you aiming at or what are your aims what are your goals what's your target it's all based on not hunting metaphor and the fact that Ishmael becomes an archer means that he's someone who can take him at the center of the bullseye and hit it precisely and so that's an indication that he's a good man right so and and I suppose also part of the part of it carries part of the narrative weight of the story because of course he's Abraham's son and you'd expect Abraham's son to be someone who's very good at taking aim and he dwelt in the wilderness of paran and he could live there and survive which is no trivial thing and his mother took him a wife out of the land of Egypt okay so that's the story of Hagar and it's a fairly straightforward story it's complex emotionally but it doesn't and it and it brings up the terrible theme of familial catastrophe and the complications of romantic and familial relationships and all of that but it's really serves as a pro drama to the next story which is the one that's so complex and so difficult to understand and it came to pass after these things that God did tempt Abraham which is a funny thing for God to do I suppose and said unto Him Abraham and he said behold Here I am and God said take now thy son thine only son Isaac who the lovest and at the end of the land of Moriah and offer him there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I will tell thee up and Abraham rose up early in the morning and saddled his ass and took two of his young men with him and Isaac his son and clave the wood for the burnt offering it rose up and went unto the place of which God had told him then on the third day of journeying Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place afar off the neighbor hem said unto his young men abide ye ye here with the ass and I and the lad will go yonder and worship and come again to you it's really one of the first times that we've come across the word worship if I remember correctly and that's a very difficult word to contend with to know is he if you like me or if you're like me when I was a kid because I haven't thought about this for a long time it was never really obvious to me why God would want to be worshipped you know as to go to church and you offer up your praise and thanks to God and you say well really does that make a lot of sense it's like why in the world is that what he wants it's like it's almost like you're you're you're you're kneeling down in front of an ancient Middle Eastern you know tyrannical Emperor and and vowing your submission and that never sat well with me and I suppose it doesn't sit well with many people and I think that's because it's it's not the proper way of conceptualizing it like what happens when you see what Abraham does continually and this seems to be implicit in the use of the word worship in this particular situation is that you know he as we discussed he has an adventure in his life that comes to an end so there's an episode in this life it comes to an end and then there's a period of you might consider it re where he reconstitutes himself to some degree and it's that's when he makes the sacrifices and it seems to me that it's that reconstitution that constitutes the worship the worship is something like you know this is alluding back to my original proposition that it's how you act that's the issue and the worship is the decision to enact the good in whatever form it is that you can conceptualize it as well as trying to continually reconceptualize the good in a manner that makes the good that you're conceptualizing even that much better right because when you start aiming the probability that you're going to be aiming in the right direction is very low but hypothetically as you aim and as you practice and as you learn the target is going to shift in front of your eyes and you're going to be able to follow whatever more clearly and so and that seems to me and especially given the context that this word is used in this particular story is much more appropriate interpretation of what constitutes proper worship and I suppose it's akin to the later Christian idea that it's the imitation of Christ that's the sacred duty of every Christian of every Christian and every human being I suppose insofar as that's an archetypal idea an idea is something like well it's the embodiment of the good that's the issue and it's not your stated belief in the good and you know when nature was criticizing Christianity this is actually one of the things that he brought up as a major issue he said that he believed Christianity had lost its way because it had introduced a confusion between stated belief which is say your belief in the divinity of Christ whatever it means if you state that it isn't obvious what it means that when you state that because it isn't obvious what it would mean that you believe it or even what it is that you're believing in as far as Nietzsche was concerned in some sense not only was that beside the point it was dangerously beside the point because it actually allowed the Christian believer not to adopt the moral burden that was actually appropriate to the faith which was - and this is I'm using a kind of a Union concept here to manifest the archetype within the confines of your own life and that's to make the divine that your relationship with the divine your relationship with the transcendent an infinite into something that's actually realizable in the context of your own life which is to say well you know you're supposed to you're supposed to again to act out the highest good of which you're capable now that will transform your life to some degree into an archetypal adventure there's no way around that because as you attempt to climb a higher mountain let's say or to aim at a higher target or something like that then the things around you will become increasingly dramatic and of import that happens by necessity obviously because if you're aiming at something difficult and profound and you're really working at it then your life is going to become perhaps increasingly difficult and profound but that might be okay you might that might be exactly what you need as an antidote to the implicit limitations that face you as a human being so and I am the lad will go yonder and worship and come again to you now there's an implication here too that it's a foreshadowing that that Abraham offering up his son is actually a form of worship and that's that it's continuous with what he's already done and well now I'm going to read you some of the things that I've written and then all return to this and we'll see how that goes so life is suffering that's clear there's no more basic irrefutable truth it's basically as we've seen what God tells out of and Eve immediately before he kicks them out of paradise quote unto the woman he said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee and unto Adam he said because you have hearkened unto the voice of thy wife and hast eaten of the tree which I commanded thee saying thou shalt not eat of it cursed is the ground for thy sake in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee and thou shalt eat the herb of the field by the sweat of your brow you will eat your food until you return to the ground since from it you were taken for dust you are and to dust you will return rough you know and we've associated that with with Adam and Eve's eyes opening and then becoming self conscious and discovering the future and becoming fully aware and falling into history and it seems to me to be a very realistic existential portrayal of the predicament of humankind what in the world should be done about that the simplest most obvious and most direct answer pursue pleasure to follow your impulses live for the moment do expedient lie cheat steal deceive manipulate but don't get caught in an ultimately meaningless universe what possible difference could it make and this is by no means a new idea the fact of life's tragedy in the suffering that is part of it has been used to justify the pursuit of immediate selfish gratification for a very long time now even reading young he often writes as if before the rise of the conflict between religion and science and which culminated saying each his pronouncement about the death of God that people lived ensconce quite safely within a religious conceptualization that have you´d their life with meaning and that that was and that was just the state of reality you know but there's ancient writings that makes it quite clear that the crisis of faith that characterizes a modern people were certainly far from unknown in the past and here's one of those writings this is from wisdom - the Revised Standard Version short and sorrowful is our life and there is no remedy when a man comes to his end and no one has been known to return from Hades because we were born by mere chance and hereafter we shall be as though we had never been because the breath in our nostrils is smoke and reason is just a spark kindled by the beating of our hearts when it is extinguished our body will turn to ashes their spirit will dissolve like empty air our name will be forgotten in time and no one will remember our works our life will pass away like the traces of a cloud and be scattered like mist that is chased by the Rays of the Sun and overcome by its heat for our allotted time is but the passing of a shadow and there is no return from our death because it is sealed up and no one turns back come therefore let us enjoy the good things that exist and make use of the creation to the full as in youth let us take our fill of costly wines and perfumes and let no flower of spring passes by let us crown ourselves with rosebuds before they wither let none of us fail to share in our revelry everywhere let us leave signs of enjoyment because this is our portion and this is our Lord let us oppress the righteous poor man let us not spare the widow nor regard the gray hairs of the agent but letter might be our right for what is weak proves itself to be useless it's an amazing piece of writing you know it starts with an announcement of the rationale for nihilism and ends with the justification for a fascist tyranny you know and it's it's thousands of years old it's it's a remarkable thing to see and to be laid out so concisely the pleasure of expediency may be fleeting but it's pleasure nonetheless and that's something to stack up against the terror and pain of existence every man for himself and the devil take the hindmost as the old proverb has it why not simply take everything you can get whenever the opportunity arises why not determine to live in that manner what's the alternative and why should we bother with it our ancestors worked out very sophisticated answers to such questions but we still don't understand them very well this is because they are in large part still implicit manifest primarily in ritual and myth and as of yet incompletely articulated we act them out represent them in stories but we're not wise enough yet to formulate them explicitly was still chimps in a troop or wolves in a pack we know how to behave we know who's who and why we've learned that through experience our knowledge has been shaped by our interaction with others we've established predictable routines and patterns of behavior but we don't really understand them or know where they origin ated they've evolved over great expanses of time no one was formulating them explicitly at least not in the dimmest reaches of the past even though we've been telling each other how to act forever one day however not so long ago we woke up we were already doing but we started noticing what we were doing we started using our bodies as devices to represent their own actions we started imitating and dramatizing we invented ritual we started acting out our own experiences then we started to tell stories we coated our observations of our own drama in those stories in this manner the information that was first only embedded in our behavior became represented in our stories but we didn't and we still don't understand what it all meant the biblical narrative of paradise in the fall is one such story fabricated by our collective imagination working over the centuries it provides a profound account of the nature of being and points the way to a mode of conceptualization and action well matched to that nature in the Garden of Eden prior to the dawn of self-consciousness so goes the story human beings were sinless our primordial parents Adam and Eve walked with God then tempted by the snake the first couple ate from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil discovered death and vulnerability and turned away from God mankind was exiled from paradise and began its effortful mortal existence the idea of sacrifice enter soon afterwards beginning with the account of Cain and Abel and developing as we've seen through the Abrahamic stories after much contemplation struggling humanity learns that God's favor could be gained and his wrath averted through proper sacrifice and also that bloody murder might be motivated among those unwilling or unable to succeed in this manner when engaging in sacrifice our forefathers began to act out what would be considered a proposition if it were stated in words that something better might be attained in the future by giving up something of value in the present recall if you will that the necessity for work is one of the curses placed by God upon Adam and his descendants in consequence of original sin Adams waking to the fundamental constraints of his being his vulnerability his eventual death that's equivalent to the discovery of the future the future that's where you go to die hopefully not too soon your demise might be staved off through work through the sacrifice of the now to benefit later it is for this reason among others no doubt that the concept of sacrifice is introduced in the biblical chapter immediately following the drama of the fall there's little difference between sacrifice and work they're also both uniquely human sometimes animals act as if they're working but they're really only following the dictates of their natures beavers build dams they do so because their beavers and beavers build dams they don't think yeah but I'd rather be on a beach in Mexico with my girlfriend while they're doing it prosaically such sacrifice work is delay of gratification but that's a very mundane phrase to describe something of soul-shattering significance the discovery that gratification could be delayed was simultaneously the discovery of time and with it causality long ago in the dim mists of time we began to realize that reality was structured as if it could be bargained with we learned that behaving properly now in the present regulating our impulses considering the plight of others could bring rewards in the future in a time and place that did not yet exist we began to inhibit control and organize our immediate impulses so that we could stop interfering with other people and our future selves doing so was indistinguishable from organizing society the discovery of the causal relationship between our efforts today and the quality of tomorrow motivated the social contract the organization that enables today's work to be stored reliably mostly in the form of promises from others understanding is something that's often acted out before it can be articulated just as a child acts out what it means to be mother or father before being able to give a spoken account of what those roles mean the idea the act of making a ritual sacrifice to God was an early and sophisticated enactment of the idea of the usefulness of delay there's a long conceptual journey between merely feasting hungrily and learning to set aside some extra meat smoked by the fire for the end of the day or for someone who isn't present it takes a long time to learn to keep anything later for yourself or to share it with someone else and those are very much the same thing as in the former case you're sharing with your future self it's much easier and far more likely to selfishly it immediately Wolf's down everything in sight there are similar long journeys between every leap and sophistication with regards to delay and its conceptualization short term sharing storing away from the for the future representation of that storage in the form of Records and later in the form of currency and ultimately the saving of money in a bank or other institution some conceptualizations had to serve as intermediaries or the full range of our practices and ideas surrounding sacrifice and work and their representation could have never emerged our ancestors acted out a drama a literary fiction they personified the force that governs fate as a spirit that can be bargained with traded with as if it were another human being and the amazing thing is that it worked this was in part because the future is largely composed of other human beings often precisely those who have watched and evaluated and appraised the tiniest details of your past behavior it's not very far from that to God sitting above on high tracking your every move and writing it down for further reference in a big book here's a productive symbolic idea the future is a judgmental father that's a good start but two additional archetypal foundational questions arose because of the discovery of sacrifice of work both have to do with the ultimate extension of the logic of work which is sacrifice now to gain later first question what must be sacrificed small sacrifices might be sufficient to small to solve small singular problems but it's possible that larger more comprehensive sacrifices might solve an array of large and complex problems all at the same time that's harder but it might be better adapting to the necessary discipline of medical school for example will fatally interfere with the licensee estoppel giving that up as a sacrifice but a physician can to quote George w really put food on his family that's a lot of trouble dispensed with over a very long period of time so sacrifices are necessary to improve the future and larger sacrifices can be better second question introduction we've already established the basic principle sacrifice will improve the future but what's implied by that in the most extreme and final of cases where does that basic principle find its limits we must ask to begin with what would be the largest most effective most pleasing of all possible sacrifices and then how good might the best possible future be if the most effective possible sacrifice could be made the biblical story of Cain and Abel Adam and Eve's sons immediately follows the story of the expulsion from paradise as mentioned previously Cain and Abel are really the first humans since their parents were made directly by God and not born in the standard manner Cain and Abel live in history not in Eden they must work they must make sacrifices to please God and they do so with altar and proper ritual but things get complicated Abel's offerings please God but Cain's do not Abel is rewarded many times over but Cain is not it's not precisely clear why although the text strongly hints that Cain's heart is just not in it maybe the quality of what Cain put forward was low maybe his spirit was begrudging or maybe God was just feeling crabby and all of this is realistic including the texts vagueness of explanation not all sacrifices are of equal quality furthermore it often appears that sacrifices of apparently high quality are sometimes not rewarded with a better future and it's not clear why why isn't God happy what would have to change to make him so these are difficult questions and everyone asks them all the time even if they don't notice asking such questions is indistinguishable from thinking the realization that pleasure could be usefully forestalled dawned with a difficulty that's almost impossible to overstate such a realization runs absolutely contrary to our ancient fundamental animal instincts which demand immediate satisfaction particularly under conditions of deprivation which are both inevitable and commonplace and to complicate the matter such delay only becomes useful when civilization has stabilized itself enough to guarantee the existence of the delayed reward if everything you say will be destroyed or worse stolen there's no point saving it's for this reason that a wolf will down 20 pounds of raw meat in a single meal he isn't thinking man I hate it when I binge I should save some of this for next week there's a developmental progression from animal to human it's wrong no doubt in the details but it's sufficiently correct for our purposes and theme first there's excess food large carcasses mammoths or other massive herbivores might provide that way a lot of mammoths maybe all of the with a large animal there's some left for later after a kill that's accidental at first but eventually the utility of for later starts to be appreciated some provisional notion of sacrifice develops at the same time if I leave some now even if I want it now I won't have to be hungry later that provisional notion then develops to the next level if I leave some for later I won't have to go hungry and neither will those I care for and then to the next level I can't possibly eat all this mammoth but I can't store the rest for too long either maybe I should feed some to other people maybe they'll remember and feed me some of their mammoths when they have some and I have none then I'll get some mammoths now and some mammoths later that's a good deal and maybe those I'm sharing with will come to trust me more generally maybe then we could trade forever in such a manner mammoth becomes future mammoth and future mammoth becomes personal reputation that's the emergence of the social contract to share does not mean to give away something you value and get nothing back that's only instead what every child who refuses to share is afraid that it means to share means properly to initiate the process of trade a child who can't share who can't trade can't have any friends because having friends is a form of trade Benjamin Franklin once suggested that a newcomer to a neighbourhood asked a new neighbor to do him or her a favor citing an old maxim he that has once done you a kindness will be more ready to do you another than he whom you yourself have obliged in Franklin's opinion asking something for someone asking someone for something not too extreme obviously was the most useful and immediate invitation to social interaction such asking allowed the neighbor to show him or herself as a good person at first encounter it also meant the neighbor could now ask the newcomer for a favor in return because of the debt incurred in that manner both parties could overcome their natural hesitancy and mutual fear of the stranger it's better to have something rather than nothing it's better yet to generously share the something you have it's even better than that however to become widely known for generous sharing that's something that lasts that's something that's reliable and at this point in abstraction we can observe how the groundwork for the conceptions of reliable honest and generous have been laid the basis for an articulated morality has been put in place the productive truthful sharer is the prototype for the good citizen and the good man we can see in this manner how from the simple notion that leftovers are a good idea the highest moral principles might emerge it's as if something like this happened as humanity developed first were the endless tens or hundreds of thousands of years prior to the emergence of written history and drama during this time the twin practices of delay and exchange began to emerge slowly and painfully then they became represented in metaphorical abstraction as rituals and tales of sacrifice told in a manner such as this it's as if there's a powerful figure in the sky who sees all and is judging you giving up something you value seems to make them happy and you want to make them happy because all hell breaks loose if you don't so practice sacrificing and sharing until you become expert at it and things will go well for you no one said any of this at least not so plainly and directly but it was implicit in the practice and then in the stories action came first as it had to as the animals we once were could act but could not think implicit unrecognized value came first as the actions that preceded thought bodied value but did not make that value explicit people watched the successful succeed and the unsuccessful fail for thousands and thousands of years we thought it over and we drew a conclusion the successful among us delay gratification the successful among us bargained with the future a great idea began to emerge taking ever more clearly articulated form and ever more clearly articulated stories what's the difference between the successful and the unsuccessful for the successful sacrifice things get better as the successful practice their sacrifices the questions become increasingly precise and simultaneously broader what's the greatest possible sacrifice for the greatest possible good and the answer has become increasingly deeper and profound the god of Western tradition like so many gods requires sacrifice we've already examined why but sometimes he goes even further he demands not only sacrifice but the sacrifice of precisely what is loved best this is most starkly portrayed and most confusingly evident in the story of Abraham and Isaac Abraham beloved of God long wanted the son and God promised him exactly that after many delays and under the imperative possible conditions of old age and a long barren wife but not so long afterward when the miraculously born Isaac is still a child God turns around and in apparently barbaric fashion demands that his faithful servant offer his son as a sacrifice the story ends happily God sends an angel to stay Abraham's obedient hand and accepts a ram and Isaac stead that's a good thing it doesn't really address the issue at hand why was God's going further necessary why does he why his life impose such demands we'll start our analysis with the truism stark self-evident and understated sometimes things do not go well that seems to have much to do with the terrible nature of the world with its plagues and its famines and its tyrannies and its betrayals but here's the rub sometimes when things are not going well it's not the world that it's the cause the cause is instead that which is most valued why because the world is revealed to an in terment degree through the template of your values if the world you are seeing is not the world you want therefore it's time to examine your values it's time to rid yourself of your current presuppositions it's time to let go it might even be time to sacrifice what you love best so that you can become who you might become instead of staying who you are something valuable given up ensures fused future prosperity something valuable sacrifice pleases the Lord what is most valuable and best sacrificed or what is at least emblematic of that a choice cut of meat the best animal in a flock a most valued possession what's above even not something intensely personal and painful to give up that symbolized perhaps in God's insistence on circumcision as part of Abraham sacrificial routine what's beyond that what pertains more closely to the whole person rather than the part what constitutes the ultimate sacrifice for the gain of the ultimate prize it's a close race between child and self the sacrifice of the mother offered her child to the world is exemplified for example by Michelangelo's great sculpture the Pieta Michelangelo crafted Mary contemplating her son crucified in ruins so she's sitting most of you know the sculpture she's sitting and the body of her son is in her arms adults on and it's broken and he's been destroyed and it's a very beautiful but very tragic work of genius work of genius level representation Michelangelo crafted Mary contemplating her son crucified and rude it's her fault it was through her that he entered the world and it's great drama of being is it right to bring a baby into this terrible world every woman asks herself that question some say no they have their reasons Mary answers yes voluntarily knowing full well what's to come as do all mothers if they allow themselves to see it's an act of supreme courage when it's undertaken voluntarily in turn Mary's son Christ offers himself to God and the world to betrayal torture and death to the very point of despair on the cross where he cries out those terrible words my God my God why hast thou forsaken me that is the archetypal story of the man who gives his all for the sake of the better who offers up his life for the advancement of being who allows God's will to become manifest fully within the confines of a single mortal life that is the model for the Honorable man in Christ case however as he sacrifices himself God his father is simultaneously sacrificing his son it's for this reason that the Christian sacrificial drama of son and self is archetypal it's a story at the limit where nothing more extreme nothing greater can be imagined that's the very definition of archetypal that's the core of what constitutes religious pain and suffering define the world of that there can be no doubt sacrifice can hold pain and suffering in abeyance to a greater or lesser degree and greater sacrifices can do that more effectively than lesser of that two there can be no doubt everyone holds this knowledge in their soul thus the person who wishes to alleviate suffering who wishes to defy the flaws in being who wishes to bring about the best of all possible futures who wants to create heaven on earth will make the greatest of sacrifices of self and child of everything that is loved to live a life am dat the good he will forego expediency he will pursue the path of ultimate meaning and he will in that manner bring salvation to the ever desperate world on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes and saw the place far off it's not an accident also that it's in a mountain right because a mountain is something you have to climb and you have to climb to the pinnacle of a mountain and the mountain is upright and the mountain stretches up to heaven and it's a long journey to specify the right place on the highest pinnacle and and that's symbolic because of course it's a pinnacle that you're always trying to reach just like you're always trying to aim you're always trying to climb upward at least that's the theory depends to some degree of course on your definition of upward and Abraham said to his young men abide here with the ass and I and the lad will go yonder and worship and come to you again and Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering and laid it upon Isaac his son and he took the fire in his hand and a knife and they went both of them together and Isaac spake unto Abraham his father and said My father and he said here am I my son and he said Behold the fire in the wood but where is the lamb for a burnt offering and Abraham said my son God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering so they went both of them together and they came to the place which God had told him of and Abraham built an altar there and laid the wood in order and bound Isaac his son and laid him on the altar upon the wood and Abraham stretched forth his hand and took the knife to slay his son and the angel of the Lord called unto him out of heaven and said Abraham and he said here am I an angel said lay not thine hand upon the lad neither do thou anything unto him for now I know that thou fearest God seeing thou hast not withheld thy son an only son from me when I was answering the questions last night at this Q&A this guy asked me this question he said that he had parents who were desperate anti-social alcoholic addicted friendless and that they didn't want him to leave their home he was the only relationship they had but that was of he was the only relationship they had and he asked what he should do and I told him that he should leave and the reason for that is that you have a moral obligation as a parent to encourage your child to go out into the world right and to be whoever they can be to be the best they can possibly be and in doing that you're offering you're encouraging them to pursue the good you're sacrificing them to the good you're not keeping them for yourself selfishly you're telling them that they can go out and live their life and live it properly and and that's the parallel to the idea of the sacrifice of Isaac as far as I can tell you don't want for your son what it is that you want for him you want for your son what would be best for him and for the world and you let go in precise proportion to your desire to have that happen you know the psychoanalyst the great psychoanalyst I say the psychoanalyst I think this is actually Freud's dictum but I'm not certain of that he said the good mother fails which is a bit a brilliant observation because when you have an infant do you do everything for the infant because the infant can do nothing for him or herself but as the infant matures and is increasingly capable of doing things for him or herself then you pull back right you pull back and everytime the child develops the ability to do something you allow them or encourage them to do it and you don't interfere you know so if your child is struggling getting dressed well obviously there's some times that you help them but mostly you let them learn so that they can know how to do it in the future that's better for you and it's certainly better for them there's a rule if you're working with the elderly in an old-age home and the rule is something like don't do anything for any of the for any of the guests let's say that they can do for themselves because you compromise their independence and so as a mother you pull back and you pull back and you let your child hit him or herself against the world and you fail to protect them but by failing to protect them you encourage and ennoble them to the point where you're no longer necessary now they may still want to see you and it would be wonderful if that was the case but the point is is that you're supposed to remove yourself from the equation by encouraging your child to be the best possible person that person can be and you sacrifice your desires all of your desires to that your personal desires even your desires for your child in relationship to you because you want them to move forward into the world as a light right as a light on a hill that's what you want if you have any sense and so you don't get to keep your children at home because you need them now I'm talking generally obviously and there are circumstances under which families make their own idiosyncratic decisions and I'm not trying to dam everyone with a with a casual gesture you know but the point is still strong that the good father is precisely someone who is willing to sacrifice his child to the ultimate good that's dramatized in this story you know and it's brutal but the world is a brutal place and much wisdom comes out of catastrophe and this is an indication of how much catastrophe our ancestors had to plow through had to work through in order to generate the sub structure for the conceptions of freedom even that we have to they for freedom and the good and that's how the story appears to me now I think there's more to it I think if there has to be more to it it lays the groundwork at least in the Christian context for the eventual emergence of Christ as I alluded to in my reading that story obviously has to be unpacked and unpacked and unpacked just like it has been for the last two thousand years it's also an indication here of well I would say the transmutation of sacrifice into an increasingly psychological form which is a development that we've tracked all the way through the Old Testament up to this particular point first acted out then represented in ritual those would be the rituals of sacrifice then laid out in story then turned into a psychological phenomena so that now we're capable of making sacrifices in abstraction right to conceptualize a future that we want to let go of the things that are stopping us from moving forward and to free ourselves from the chains of our original preconceptions and that's laid out in these old stories as the optimal path way of being and there's a philosopher of science named Karl Popper very sensible and down-to-earth person who was talking about thinking and its nature and he was thought about thinking in a Darwinian fashion he said the purpose of thinking is to let your thoughts die instead of you it's a brilliant notion and so the idea is something like you can conjure up a representation of yourself you can conjure up a variety of potential representations of yourself in the future you can lay out how those future representations of yourself are likely to prevail or fail you can call the potential use in the future that will fail and then you can embody the ones that will succeed you do that well simultaneously conjuring up a representation of your current state and determining for yourself because of your undue suffering which elements of your pathetic being need to be given up so that you can move forward into that future and the goal what is it that you're aiming at with that work and not sacrifice that's the ultimate question it's the question I was trying to address in that writing what is it that you're trying to do when you're trying to improve the future we believe that the future can be improved we believe that it can be improved as a consequence of our sacrificial work and so once again what are the limitations what are the limits to that what are the necessary limits to that I would say we don't know I would say as well that that's actually something that the entire corpus of biblical stories is trying desperately to articulate to figure out and articulate right we we conjured up this remarkable idea the future exists we can see it even though it's only potential we can adjust our behavior in the present in order to maximize our probability of success in the future how best to do that well the idea is something like don't hesitate to offer the ultimate sacrifice if you want the future to turn out ultimately well now obviously that idea is closed in metaphysical speculation and religious imagery but it still remains an intensely practical issue right what is it that you could contract for let's say if you were willing to give up everything about you that's weak and unworthy the there's a there's a continual hints of that in the Old Testament right because what happens with Noah of course is that he establishes the proper covenant with God the proper contract with being let's say and thrives as a consequence and the neighborhood does the same thing there's a strong intimation that that's how the world is set right now that idea develops and magnifies as the stories progress into something like into something like the concept of heaven on earth the notion being that the proper sacrificial attitude produces a psychological state and then the social state that's a manifestation of that attitude that decreases the probability that the world will Carine into hell and increases the probability that people will live high-quality meaningful private lives in a society that's balanced and capable of supporting that and none of that seems to me to be questionable really I also don't think it's anything that people don't actually know you know people have told me many times that when they listen to me talk they are hearing things that they already know knew but didn't know how to say it's something like that and this is one of those things that I think is exactly like that I mean I think it's at the very core of our moral knowledge and which is our behavioral knowledge and our perceptual knowledge I mean let's get this straight moral knowledge is no trivial matter it's knowledge about how it is that you orient yourself in the world there's no more profoundly necessary form of knowledge oh it's predicated on on something that's exactly like this we know that we have to make sacrifices we know that we have to omit what's good so then why isn't that we don't aim at what's best and make the sacrifices that are necessary in order to bring that into play I think it seems to me that in some sense that's self-evident the question is why we don't do it but there's answers to that too already in material that we've covered life is hard and it hurts people it's ripe with limitation and some of its arbitrary and it's no wonder and some of its unjust and some of it's worse some of its malevolent which is even worse than something I haven't talked about at all in this lecture it's not surprising that that combination of vicissitude can turn people against being but I think even when that happens and even when people have the kind of history that if they revealed to you you would say well it's no wonder you turned out that way the people who turn out that way still know that it's wrong they still know that however deep their own suffering however arbitrary their own suffering however much that's caused by the malevolence of others as well as the tragedy of existence that that does not in any way justify their turning away from the good and I believe everyone knows that I believe that they know it implicitly even if they don't allow themselves to know it explicitly and I believe that if they violate that idea then they violate themselves and that they end up in Kane's position which is the position of the man who's been given a punishment that is too great to bear an angel said [Applause] lay not thine hand upon the loud now to do without anything unto him for now I know that thou fearest God seeing thou hast not withheld thy son thine only son from me and Abraham lifted up his eyes and looked and behold behind him a ram caught in a thicket by his thorns by his horns and Abraham went and took the RAM and offered him up for a burnt offering instead of his son and Abraham called the name of that place Jehovah Jireh as it is said to this day in the mount of the Lord it shall be seen and the angel of the Lord called unto Abraham out of heaven the second time and said by myself have I sworn saith the Lord for because thou has done this thing and has not withheld thy son thine only son that in blessing I will bless thee and in multiplying I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand which is upon the sea shore and thy seed shall possess the gates of his gate of his enemies and in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed because thou hast obeyed my voice so Abraham returned unto his young men and they rose up and went together to Beersheba and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba and it came to pass after these things that it was told Abraham saying he hold Milka she has also borne children unto thy brother Nahor and Sarah was a hundred and seven and twenty years old those were the years of the life of Sarah and Sarah died in quor'toth Arba the same as Hebron in the land of Canaan and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah and a weeper well I don't exactly know what to do now because that [Applause] I'll review what we've what we've covered and then I'll bring this to a close we can have some more questions than would be usual tonight so what have we established by this point the stories that have been revealed so far are something like they contain the idea that there's something divine that's analogous to the human capacity for communication and attention that's at the it operates at the genesis of being itself that's the initial account in the Old Testament it's an account that places the role of Spirit centrally in the in the nature of being now I'm not exactly sure what to make of that because in some ways I'm is materialistically oriented as modern people typically are but the stories make sense to me in many ways the idea that there's something world creating about human consciousness and that that's akin in some sense to the divine force that called order out of chaos at the beginning of time seems to me to be a very powerful metaphysical idea and it also seems to me to be an idea that is immovable at the foundation of Western culture because our entire legal system our society our expect mutual expectations all of that are conditioned to the final degree by our presupposition that each of us has an intrinsic value that transcends the local conditions of our being and it's with that presupposition that we've been able to establish the society that functions a society that functions and functions well and it has its current characterization and that's a nun it's an unlikely occurrence and it's a non-trivial reality and I don't see any way out of that way out of that conclusion I don't see anything that that can easily be replaced with and so god calls being into order into being out of chaos at the beginning of time and the tributes to human beings the same essential capacity then we turn to Adam and Eve in the garden and they're unconscious by all appearances allied tightly with God but unconscious they don't seem aware of the future they don't seem aware of themselves they don't seem aware of their own vulnerability they make the fatal error of having their eyes open they discover their own vulnerability they also discover their capacity for evil we reviewed that to some degree what's the association because it's the tree of the knowledge of good and evil the fruit of which they eat what's the association between the discovery of vulnerability and the emergence of moral knowledge it's something like as far as I can tell that you actually don't know how to be evil or to be good until you're actually aware consciously of your own vulnerability because the essence of evil is the exploitation of vulnerability perhaps for the sake of that exploitation and I can't understand how to hurt someone until I know exactly how I can be hurt myself and I can't understand how I can be hurt myself until I become cognizant of my mortal limitations until I understand what brings me pain until I understand the suffering that goes along with my mortal limitations my my inevitable death and the suffering that goes along with that and with the with the accrual of the knowledge of mortality and good and evil Adam and Eve are cast out of paradise and history begins and that seems right to me because I don't think that history did begin before human beings became self conscious so there's something about that that's right if his three doesn't really begin until people become aware of the future history doesn't really begin until until people work and start to build right we still live we would still be ensconced in essentially an animal existence until we're aware of the future and start to buttress herself against it start to wear clothing start to build buildings start to make cities all in all in consequence of having become aware of the fact that we're fragile and that the future is a dangerous place so that seems to me to be existentially correct and then we have the story of Cain and Abel brilliantly placed immediately afterwards and so those are the two first two people in history essentially and they make sacrifices so that goes along with the idea of the discovery worked and necessity of work and the discovery of the future and then exactly what you'd expect would happen one segment of mankind let's say makes the sacrifices properly and prevails in the other segment makes the sacrifices improperly and fails and that's perfectly reasonable given what you see around you because that's what seems to happen all the time and then more interestingly I would say that the sacrificial failure produces embitterment right and that embedment produces a hatred for being and a desire for revenge that seems perfectly appropriate when I look at people who are bitter and who want revenge it's generally because their sacrificial efforts have failed now I'm loathe to say that that's a matter of their own doing although sometimes it clearly is the embittered and vengeful complained to God and blame him for the structure of existence you know I read about the Columbine massacre and the kids who undertook it that'll make your hair stand on end if you want to read something that will really disturb you reading Erich Harris's writings will really disturb you no matter how much you know about human beings reading Erich Harris's writings will disturb you and Harris's Kane you know he says it straightforwardly he hates human beings hates being itself he would destroy everything if it was within his power to do that and of course him and his colleague were motivated to produce far more carnage than they managed that day what was successful was only a fraction of what they had planned and and Harris said very straightforwardly that he was that he had set himself up as the judge of being and that it lacked all utility in his eyes human beings certainly should all be did all be removed from the face of existence because of their pathology and the fundamental horrors of being itself so there's nothing in the Cain and Abel story that isn't real it's real and Kane complains to God as people will when their dreams are dashed and then it's goes for people who don't believe in God - it doesn't really matter you know it's harder I suppose if you're atheistic to figure out who to blame but that doesn't mean that the sentiment well it doesn't mean that the sentiment is any different right the same drama is being enacted you shake your fist at the structure of being rather than at God himself but it doesn't make any difference except in the details so God responds to Cain and tells him that he's got no right to judge being before he gets his sacrificial house in order and even worse he says that Cain is the architect of his own downfall and the invited catastrophe in his own house into his own house willingly and entered into a creative union with it and therefore brought about his own demise and it's that additional self-knowledge and you can imagine to you know imagine that you're in you're facing your life you're facing the failures of your life and let's say that you've had a failed life and you're bitter about that and then you meditate upon it and you think why has this come about and then you think well perhaps I did something wrong you know when Alexander Solzhenitsyn wrote The Gulag Archipelago which is the book that detailed the catastrophes of the Soviet you and help bring it down it is one part of that book that just struck me so so viciously when I read it he he was in the car in the GU leg and he was there for a very long time and he said that he observed a variety of people in the camps who he really admired they were rare they were usually religious believers in his in his experience who were not participating in the pathology of the camp's at all period no matter what he said he learned a lot from watching those people he had a hard time believing that they even existed that they could even exist but he said that one of the things that he was brought to as a consequence of watching those people live their contract with goodness out even under the most horrifying of conditions was that it was possible that he himself was responsible for his position in the camp now it's a very dangerous line of argumentation you know because who wants to be the one who blames the victim for the catastrophe you know you have to be very careful when you walk down that road but Solzhenitsyn was speaking about himself and he said well he was a communist you know and he arrogantly and forthrightly moved the movement out into the world and had not fully gone over his life with a fine-tooth comb to find out what mistakes he had made that brought him so low but his contention eventually was that part of the reason that he ended up where he ended up was because he and many others had completely forfeited their relationship with the truth and allowed their society to degenerate into deceit and tyrannical catastrophe without mounting sufficient opposition and so he decided when he was in the camps to straighten himself out bit by bit and that culminated in the production of the Gulag Archipelago in that book really demolished once and for all any moral credibility that the communist totalitarian systems had left and so one man in the depths of catastrophe who and through good example at least in part to stop lying produced a book eventually the demolished the foundation of the very system that had imprisoned him and that is really worth thinking about that's one example of the absolute grandeur of the human soul and the capacity for transformation that it has when let loose properly on the world so let's say you're conceptualizing your own failure you know and you meditated on it and you come to the conclusion that God forced Cain to pay not only have things not been going very well for you but it's actually your fault and not only that you brought it on yourself and not only that you knew it all the time well then you might think you'll wake up and fly right right you'll get your wings in order and fly right but there's no reason to assume that at all and that's not what happens to Cain that just makes him more bitter right and you can understand that if you think about it just for a second it's like bad enough when something horrible happens to you but then to have to swallow the additional pill right have to take in the information that you could have done something different it was avoidable and you knew it at the time and you decided to do it anyways and I think people are in that situation a lot more often than ever anyone is willing to admit you know you have that little voice in the back of your head that says don't do it and you override it and you know it's arrogance that makes you override it it's always arrogance you know it always warns you to always arrogance yeah I can get away with it it's like no you can't I don't think you ever get away with anything so and maybe your experience has taught you different but my suspicions are it hasn't and if you think it has well the other shoe hasn't yet dropped so Cain doesn't take the opportunity to let God's wisdom reorient his character and that that could have been outcome he could have got down on his knees so to speak and said oh my oh my god I've been wrong all along I've been living improperly I've been making the wrong sacrifices Abel deserves everything he has I got exactly what was coming to me you know could I possibly now Street myself out and and and and and live in repentance and improve my position but that's not what he did at all he said all right fair enough I get it it's like I'm going to go after the thing I most admire and I'm going to destroy it and I'm going to do that despite its cost to me and I'm going to do that just to spite the creator of being that's exactly what Paris did at Columbine it's exactly what he says in fact it is uncanny writings it's why the mass murderers always shoot themselves afterwards not before because you might wonder if you're so upset with the structure of being why you don't just commit suicide in your basement why do you have to go out and mass murder before you top it off with a gun to your forehead well you don't make the point as effectively if you just commit suicide in your basement it's like well I'm I life means nothing to me but neither does anyone else's and neither does the structure of being itself and I'll take all my revenge as much as I possibly can and then just to show you how little I care I'll cap myself off at the end and I would say also people say all the time I don't understand how that could happen it's like I don't believe that I think an hour of thought of real thought real thought about your darkest feelings about existence itself illuminates the pathway to that sort of behavior quite clearly I think if you I mean I might be wrong I might be a darker person than most and it's certainly okay okay well at least I think there are plenty of people out there who are sufficiently dark to know exactly what I mean what I'm saying these things and I would also say that if it doesn't leap to your understanding how that pathway might be illuminated then you need to know a lot more about yourself than you actually know now because whatever you might say about someone like Eric Harris he was a human being too you know there's this idea in the New Testament that Christ was he who took the sins of the world unto himself it's a very complicated idea but part of it part of it part of it is associated with the idea that he met the devil in the desert as well to take the sins of mankind onto yourself as to understand that within you dwells exactly the same spirit that commit the atrocities that Columbine or that ran the camps at Auschwitz and to actually understand that that's part and parcel of your makeup and then to take responsibility for it and I think that in the aftermath of the terrible 20th century that's what we're left with we are left with the necessity to take responsibility for the most terrible aspects of ourselves and that way perhaps we can stop those terrible things from happening again that also means you know that you don't look for the you don't look for the what would you call it the purveyor of malevolence outside yourself right it isn't someone else even though sometimes it's someone else you know you know what I mean it's like there are identifiable perpetrators but that's not precisely the point the point is something more like that the proper place for the encapsulation of that malevolence at least the proper place to start is within the confines of your own existence and then perhaps within the confines of your family and that way you're not a danger to those that you miss apprehend as malevolent and evil because you won't get your aim right to begin with you'll identify them improperly and you'll take your revenge in a manner that allows you to omit your own responsibility to act out your unconscious desire for revenge and to move the world just that much closer to help also Cain kills Abel and then Cain gives rise to his descendants one of whom is the person who's the first artificer in weapons of war and then comes the flood right which seems perfectly miraculously reasonable to me because what those stories do it's so amazing that the story of Cain and Abel segues into the story of the flood because it is the case that the catastrophes that beset society can best be conceptualized as the spread of individual pathology into the social world and the envy what would you call these the magnification of that pathology to the point where everything comes apart and I truly believe that if you familiarize yourself with the last hundred years of history that that's the conclusion that you would derive and the people who are most wise that I've read who commented on that say the same thing over and over which is the key to the prevention of the horrors of Auschwitz and the gulag in the future is the reconstruction of the individual soul at level of each individual and that's a terrible message because it puts the burden on you but it's an amazing message because it also means that you could be the source of the process that stops that catastrophe and malevolence from ever emerging again and you know it's hard for me to imagine that you have anything that could possibly be better to do with the time that you have left well then we see Noah who walks with God and who's generations are in order right which means that he's entered this contract with the good let's say that has the protective function of the ark he's put his family together and he can ride out the worst catastrophe and he's actually our ancestor right so interesting it's that these people who get their act together properly and make a contract with the good are constantly presented as the genuine ancestors of mankind and that's a really positive element of the story as well and it's one I believe because well it hasn't been easy for us to get here you know we are the descendants of the great heroes of the past and if you took all those heroes and you and you and you and you told their stories and you distilled their stories into a single story maybe you'd have a story like the story of Noah or the story of Abraham you know the story of the successful the story of our forefathers you know I'm not the cancer on the planet that certain people tend to think that we are and so the goal is to be one of the people like that and there isn't anything better that can possibly be done and the alternative is something like hell and so Noah rides out the storm and that's what everyone wants because you want to ride out the storm you don't want to be happy because that'll just happen if it does or if it doesn't but you definitely want to constitute yourself so that you can ride out the storm because the storm is always coming and so then you're fortified against the worst and that's what you want because well the best you can handle the worst you have to prepare yourself for and then we see the same thing repeated in the story of Abraham essentially right Abraham makes this contract with the good and constantly renews it that's cough ice and his worship he constantly renews it and he has the adventures that are sufficiently typical of the adventures of a human being who's alive and engaging in the world right he he bumps himself up against all the horrors of existence and yet the story is told in such a manner that reveals that his primary ethical commitment to the overarching good is sufficient to protect him against the vicissitudes of existence well that's an optimistic story and as a pessimistic person I appreciate an optimistic story that's believable and the great demands placed on Abraham it's not as if this just comes to him as a gift he has to be willing to sacrifice whatever is necessary in order to maintain that contract and so that seems to me to be realistic there's no reason to assume that life isn't so difficult that it actually demands the best from you that it's actually structured in that manner and that if the you are willing to reveal the best in you in response to the vicissitudes of life that you might actually prevail and you might actually set things straight around you and law and what if that was true that would be a remarkable thing and I can't see how it cannot be true and I can't see that it's not stamped on the soul of everyone who's conscious I think we all know this perfectly well although the stories remind us you know Plato Socrates believed that all knowledge was remembering you know he believed that the soul before birth had all knowledge and lost it at birth and then experience reminded the soul of what it already knew and there's something about that that's really true because you're not just a creature that emerged 30 years ago or 40 years ago you're you're the inheritor of three and a half billion years worth of biological engineering right you have your nature stamped deeply inside of you far more deeply than we any of us realize and when you come across these great stories these reminders they're a reminder of how to be properly and they echo in your soul because the structure is already there the external stories are manifestations of the internal reality and then they're a call to that unter internal reality to reveal itself well then we come to the end of the Abrahamic stories least this section of them with Sarah's death and Abraham is called upon to make the supreme sacrifice and interestingly not because he's willing to make the supreme sacrifice he actually doesn't have to and that's an interesting thing as well because I believe that it's reasonable from a psychological perspective to point out that the more willing you are for example to face death perhaps the less likely it is that you're going to have to face it at least in an ignoble manner and so with that then we'll bring this 12 part series to a close you know I think that applause is for everyone and I hate to say that because it sounds so new agey ha ha ha but you know it really does it really does seem to me that this is a participatory exercise you know and that and that it would not be possible for me to go through these stories without having you here to listen and so and I always think when talking to a crowd that it's a dialogue you know it's a dialogue you said and you listen and you've all listened and and and thank God for that you know and that gives me a chance to think and it gives me a chance to watch and it gives me a chance to interact because you know you're emblematic of of humanity at large I suppose that's one way of thinking about it and for me to be able to craft what I'm saying so that it has an impact on all of you here also means that I can simultaneously craft it so that it has an impact that in principle can reach far beyond this place and so you know I'm hoping that I'm really hoping that one of the things that can start to happen with this at least is that we can put our culture back on its firm foundation because it's something that's desperately needed and in order to do that we have to understand both the evil and the nobility of the human soul and that's like--that's that's a fundamental truth you know and I don't think you can get to the nobility without a soldier and through the evil I really don't believe that at all it's no place for the naive to go that's for sure but anyways I would like to thank you as you thanked me for your close and careful attention and your support during all of this it's been a really a remarkable experience it's certainly sort of developed beyond my my dreams so on to the questions hi dr."

    "text": "Peterson it appears to me from this series and from the biblical stories themselves that the emphasis of the stories is the utmost importance of the fool for the maintenance and adaptation of being or society the figure will lunge headfirst in the uncharted territory explicitly aware of the danger and risk of loss and confronting what cannot be understood but unafraid and with the zeal and that the dangers of ideological possession just as much are just as much of a concern as that individuals are unwilling and perhaps unable to form an opinion and take a stance one way or another when confronted with a fork in the road or a decision that must be made you've seen this apathy apathy throughout the universities as I have too in the public schooling system my question is how can one model being the fool to plunge into the unknown and publicly fall on your face in pursuit of learning in a way that clearly demonstrates the urgency and utility of the fool well there isn't any difference between the pool and someone whose courageous right from an archetypal perspective and I mean Abraham is a fool obviously when he starts his his adventures I mean the story lays it out in that manner he's far too old to be leaving home for example he's a late bloomer you know and and then he has he has a lot of catastrophic adventures along the way and certainly you could imagine that had you encountered him when he first encountered the famine in the land of strangers when he first went out that the idea that he had he had followed his misguided intuitions would have been self-evident but in the Abrahamic stories there is this call to get out and do and that's it and the thing is is that you know one of the things I've learned to put it to make it concretely is that like I've done a lot of different things in my life and every time I did a new thing I was a fool I did it badly I was an imposter right and and and because I when you first start to do something you don't know what you're doing but that that's okay that's an acceptance of your vulnerability right and your ignorance that's humility in some sense the willingness to be a fool in a nude in the land of strangers that's it the willingness to be a fool in the land of strangers and that's an act of courage because you also reveal your vulnerability to the world by stumbling around but as long as you're stumbling forward then you're going to move forward now how do you do that more concretely are you aim at an ideal right and you aim at an ideal that's beyond you now maybe you don't aim to begin with it an idea that ideal that's so beyond you that you're crushed by its magnificence you know maybe that's that's that's too demotivating to move you but you could at least conceptualize yourself as the you that you are with fewer of the faults that you know of and that's a good start and I also think that's associated with the idea of humility take stock figure out how it is that you're not who you could be and then move in that direction and accept the consequences you know you're you're going to get slapped a lot but maybe with each slap you'll straighten up a little bit especially if you listen even to the people who are slapping you because sometimes they're the ones who can reveal for you very quickly where it is that you're weak and insufficient so that you won't have to be that way in the future so yeah [Applause] hello dr."

    "text": "Peterson I have no questions for you all I ever wanted to do is just stand in front of you and be able to thank you for everything you've done fine my pleasure oh good morning citizen Peterson you got a short one yeah I do I mean a question eight is the best question relax trust me this one's good but first I'll break the ice now I'm going keyboard up said so state now no icebreaker you want me to get right into the real question I want you to get right into the question all right so this question is about hyper critical thinking yep now everyone knows the critical thinking is a great thing to develop you have to be able to cook I guess think about your ideas so if information is presented do you have to decide if it's legitimate or if there's some sort of deceit behind it but when it's taken to its extreme no matter how great or noble somebody is you can always find a crack in the armor and try to figure out how they're covering up something that's not great about them you know and you might then discredit everything they do is just a facade okay so let me stop you there for a sec because I want to address two of the issues that you already brought up so there's there's the issue of hyper critical thinking partly in relationship to yourself and partly in relationship to others so I'd like to address the issue with regards to yourself to begin with so there's this idea that Carl Jung developed um he extracted it I don't know from where from some ancient writings that he was familiar with I believe they were Jewish writings he said that classically speaking traditionally speaking God was viewed to rule being with two hands the right hand and left hand and the right hand was justice and that was you're going to get what's coming to you but the left hand was mercy and the idea essentially was that the cause could not exist without the proper combination of justice and mercy you should get what's coming to you but people are fallible and they make mistakes and so it's reasonable to apply that to yourself you know there's an idea that's being developed by psychologists over the last few decades that people are basically narcissistic and that they generally feel that they're better at most things than other people I don't buy that I don't think the experimental evidence for that is very strong and I certainly haven't seen that for example in my clinical practice where I've seen that people are generally far harder on themselves than they are on other people one example of that I've written about this in my new book too is that you know if you have a pet that's sick and you take it to the vet and you get medication you're very likely to give the pet the entire course of medication to go to the pharmacy to get the prescription filled to give the pet the medication to follow it through but if you are the person who has the problem yeah you all laughed if you know the story it's like a 30 you won't even go fill the prescription and of the remaining 2/3 of you half of them won't take it to completion and you think well why are people like that and I think it's because they know themselves they have contempt for themselves because of their flaws and then they come to despise themselves and I think that's a big mistake that's Locke that's too much justice and not enough mercy and you know Jung wrote about the biblical injunction that you should treat your neighbor as if he were yourself essentially but he talked about that as an equation which was quite interesting so because it's often read as something like you should be nice to people which is not what it means at all because first nice is a very low-end virtue but it isn't what it means what it means is that you should you should treat your neighbor as if he or she is someone that you wish to encourage and develop but that you should also have exactly the same attitude towards yourself which is weak sort of in some sense regardless of what your opinion is of yourself critical let's say hyper critical even is often the case with people who are anxious or perhaps who are hyper conscientious you have to put forward to yourself the same sympathy we could say that you would extend to someone else that you cared for that's the thing is that you have to come to treat yourself as if you're someone that you care for and I mean that technically you know you detach yourself from yourself and you think okay well if I was going to construct a mode of being that was optimal for this person that I happen to be what would that look like and that's sort of independent of whether or not you think you deserve it it's like maybe you deserve it maybe you don't innocent until proven guilty that's a pretty good policy but you should come to lay out a mode of being for yourself that gives you some credit you know when that will also help you in your dealings with other people but it's often very difficult for people to do that to themselves okay so that's the that's the first part of that perfect so it starts out with this hyper critical thinking and you talked a lot about Nietzsche's assertion about the death of God but I see it sort of more like a willful destruction of the heroic ideal and I guess several months ago I had occasion to look up a definition or explanation for the zeitgeist of modern victimhood outraged culture and I saw it in this particular case and I found and this paragraph okay this has what you called the rhythmic cadence that just made my hair stand up on sense and if you could look at it and read that this is better than the Lawson the image of man that dominates in modern literature in visual art cinema and theater is primarily a group gloomy image the Great and the noble are suspect from the outset they must be torn from their pedestal so that one can see through them morality counts as hypocrisy enjoy a self-deception anyone who simply puts trust in the beautiful and the good is either inexcusably in genuine or acting with evil intent the truly moral attitude is suspicion and its greatest success is in exposing criticism of society is obligatory it is impossible to find words lurid and brutal enough to describe the dangers that threaten us this delight in the negative is not however unlimited there exists at the same time an obligation to be optimistic and the failure to observe this obligation does not go unpunished for example anyone who expresses the view that not everything in the intellectual development of the modern period has been correct that is necessary in some essential areas to reflect on the shared wisdom of the great cultures has chosen to make the wrong kind of criticism he finds himself suddenly construct confronted with a resolute apologia for the fundamental decisions of the modern age no matter how much delight one may take indication he is not permitted to call into question the view that the fundamental trajectory of historical development is progress and that the good lies in the future and nowhere else you know I thought a lot about nihilism let's say and and its justification and I think that a very powerful justification for nihilism can be found in the mirror observation that life is rife with tragedy and malevolence of which there is no doubt but then I got suspicious of that rationale for nihilism over the years because a counter position to it emerged and this is something Nietzsche of course concentrated on as well that had more to do with resentment it's like you can imagine negation of the heroic ideal from despair from the despair of save produced by tragedy and by exposure to malevolence but it's also it's completely and delightfully irresponsible to negate heroic ideal because it means that you don't have any responsibilities and it seems to me that if you're nihilistic and prone to criticize the heroic foundation of let's say Western culture that one of the first questions that you could ask yourself is what makes you so sure that you're appropriately cynical suspicious and critical and not just running away as fast as you possibly can from every bit of responsibility that you could possibly adopt and I think that that's a perfectly reasonable perspective and I think that that is reflected to some degree in what the person who wrote this paragraph was attempting to you guess who it was or was that fair no I can't really no ha ha ha ha ha ha I left you a hint off at them who is it Cardinal Ratzinger come ah all right I'm going to take another question and well done hello hello how are you doing doing good dr."

    "text": "Peterson this is the first of these lectures that I've been here to listen to but I've listened to all of them on YouTube so far oh boy they're not close enough all right wait that's good okay yeah and I've been trying to think up this question since basically the first lecture because I'm a seminary student at an evangelical seminary and a lot of what you've been saying has really been resonating and it's and it's really been fascinating to listen to and you know there's many people who have been asking you questions like what do you believe about the resurrection do you believe in God are you a Christian and all these sorts of things and you know I've been listening very closely to all your answers and have groups of friends on Facebook or bowling following very closely say or what Peterson said this time maybe he's one of us finally or something like that but but at the same time other ways that you explain some of the stories sound very close to what we call theological liberalism you know in the 19th century the idea that using historical critical methods of reading and interpreting the Bible and understanding Jesus more as a moral figure than as a literal historical figure and whose atonement provides satisfaction for man so I tried to figure out what the question was because I could interpret what some of your answers were so I'm going to put it in more of a general way okay where exactly do you see yourself differing from traditional Orthodox evangelical Christianity and and why would you differ there given how much you you seem to understand the importance of the biblical stories and the Western history in Western history okay okay well that's a good that's a good question well I offer obviously I have to answer in a general way I mean I think that one of the things that makes me different is that I take the idea that things are fourteen billion years old seriously you know and and the idea of evolution seriously I mean as Daz does the Catholic Church by the way and so but I don't see that as an impediment to the pursuit that I'm undertaking now I don't know how to bridge that gap precisely but I'm not that worried about it I mean you can't bridge every gap it's just not possible it would require infinite knowledge okay and how so that that's one major because I'm coming at this from the scientific I really am coming at this from the scientific perspective you know like I try to make sure that everything that I talk about is commensurate with current scientific knowledge now current scientific knowledge no doubt is airing in all sorts of ways like I think our notion about exactly how evolution progresses is flawed in many many ways and the recent discoveries in the field of epigenetics which show that you can actually transmit acquired characteristics you know has really put a whole real serious stick in the spokes of the evolutionary bicycle let's say but but then I also think the question is miss asked in some sense because I gave this lecture series a specific title for a specific reason and the lecture series is the psychological significance of the biblical stories now I'm not claiming that my psychological analysis exhausts the significance of the biblical stories you know they have multitudes let's say layers of meaning and some of those layers of metaphysical and some of them are more specifically religious and I'm trying the best I can not to wander into those domains like I do because it's impossible to keep yourself bounded you know when you're a discursive speaker let's say I'm trying to what I'm trying to do is the sort of thing that Jung did essentially is to take a look at these old stories and say okay well let's look at this from the perspective of the human psyche and let's see what the significance can be and not to say that's all the significance there is who knows what significance there is one thing I have learned about the biblical stories is that no matter how deep you go into them you are not at the bottom and so that's been very very interesting to me and god only knows about the metaphysical substructure of reality because human beings certainly don't so I don't I don't want to claim that what I'm doing is a religious interpretation although you know it drifts into that direction I want to stay within the purview of my expertise such as it is and to say well if you look at this psychologically here's what you can extract as as pragmatically existentially and clinically meaningful and the rest of it well the rest of it has to be left in advance and because I don't have the capacity to investigate claims that go beyond that that does not mean that I'm saying that what I'm doing is reducing these stories to their psychological significance even though the psyche is a grand thing I'm not trying to do that it's not reductionistic it's a take on it so people can make up their own minds metaphysically and they also have to make up their own minds about how they're going to act which is really the crucial issue as far as I'm concerned so you bet I I had a question with respect to daddy presented I believe two weeks ago sorry a question with respect to data even presented I believe two lectures ago regarding the use of psilocybin in treatment of mental illness yes yes so subsequently I looked up some of the recently published a literature and one yeah studies that I found extremely striking was one that was published less than a year ago in The Lancet which is a very high-end yes well respected journal yeah and what they looked at was efficacy in patients with severe treatment-resistant depression and what they found is that in 11 out of 12 of the patients they showed significant remittance following it a single dose of the substance up to three months following the single dose without additional dosing so this not only substantiates I suppose my own experiences but when you read some of the commentary or review articles surrounding these types of topics not with respects to depression but things like post-traumatic stress disorder addiction they'll unequivocally state that these types of results are completely unprecedented and the realm of psychiatric medicine yes so I was wondering - good comment as to whether or not that type of this rhetoric is overblown and if not do you see these being more mainstream in your future or suspect they'll fall victim to something along the lines of regulatory capture no I don't well I don't think they're over statements and I think I know some of the people who are engaged in this research and they're actually very conservative people like their brave people but I mean conservative in the best sense you know they're not they're not Timothy Leary yeah and I'm not trying to put down Timothy Leary I'm really not but you know some caution would have been a good thing although you know when something like when the psychedelics burst onto the scene no one had any idea what to do with them right so and we still really don't but the new research is being conducted very very carefully but it is really remarkable that those episodes are used or those terms are used to describe the results because those are the lancet for example is one of the top end medical journals you don't see grand claims in The Lancet right scientists don't write that way there they're trained from the very beginning to downplay their results but they're quite struck by the fact that these effects occur with single doses now I think that what we don't know about psychedelics could fill many many many thick volumes and they're and they're absolutely mysterious in their function purpose effect consequence all of that and I've always thought that it was really appalling that we stopped investigating them back in the 1960s although it's not been that long you know 20 years historically speaking it's really nothing but and no I don't think that there'll be that the research will be stopped by regulatory capture because the people who are doing it now I think learned their lesson from what happened in the 60s and are doing it pretty damn carefully so we can hope that more results like this are produced and that they're replicable and that perhaps they'll prove helpful with any luck yep hi dr."

don't want to put you on the spot if you want to just move to your question that's fine but if you have an answer to that I would be very interested in doing what it is well it's it's a thrill to encounter a kind of means to a metaphysical system that's so persuasive and potent and I've hadn't really experienced that a whole lot in my life huh that's what universities are supposed to do for people eh that's what universities are supposed to do for people they're not supposed to take people who are barely hanging together and break them and make them weak they're supposed to equate them with the heroic the heroic sub structure of the human psyche so that they can move out into the world and thrive and it's an absolute crime that isn't what's happening so hooray for that [Applause] occurred to me that the kind of tradition and genre that you are working in here is that of this sermon now are you comfortable with that categorization and why or well see where you go with it haha well that's the essence of my question are these sermons and might no one demo I don't know h er I don't know you know sorry what was the last part light one call you a preacher well you'd certainly call me one and you know I think that there's a certain overlap and the overlap but this is being characteristic of my approach to education right from the beginning because I have some rules about what I lecture what about the topics that I lecture about and the way that I deal with it so the first rule is I don't want to tell you anything that isn't useful I'm a pragmatist you know like I'm an American pragmatist that's part of my philosophical grounding and I believe that knowledge is tool like and that the proper thing to do is to to equip people with the tools to move effectively in the world and so I want to make sure that if I offer a story or a fact for that matter I also say well here here's why you need to know this fact it will actually improve your life or it'll stop you from wandering into a pit which is approximately the same thing and then it will also knowing this will also make you more effective actor in the social world and that will improve the social world right and hopefully that will improve the environmental world etc etc and so I would say to the degree that those who produce sermons are concerned with producing alterations in behavior which is our moral alterations say then I share the same territory with them but I wouldn't say that that's something that should be only relegated to the domain of the sermon because I believe that it is the job of the universities for example especially in the damned humanities to ennoble people and to enable them to adopt the mantle of proper citizenship and that we've forgotten that we've forgotten that or we're avoiding it or refusing it or something like that you know and I think we're using the death of God as an excuse so I think that to the degree that I'm a preacher I'm making an error you know and also to the degree that I'm politicized I'm making an error I'm wandering out of my proper territory when that's the domain that I'm in but when I'm attempting to assemble multiple layers of facts towards a practical end which is what I'm trying to do and the end is the the annulment of the individual right that's my goal then then I'm in my proper domain I'm going to make mistakes you know I'm going to wander out of my territory and I try not to do that but you know it's well it's part of being a fool you're going to make mistakes so yeah thanks very much no problem doc thanks for continuing to do all the cool stuff that makes everyone love you that's great not everyone well uh yeah yeah yeah that's a generalization there's lots of people that seem not to love me yeah and I can't blame him really anyway yeah I'm going to lead into a question here so him in your book maps and rare book maps of meaning uh I got that quote from Dostoevsky about how humankind mankind - given all the cakes in the world yet oh my god so yeah if you get oh my god is right man that's one killer quote that's from notes from the underground eh everyone should read that because everyone's underground and it's a great it's a great little journey through that yeah so it's basically as you give if you have the perfect utopia I often use it basically if you have your most perfect utopia humans will find a way to screw it up yeah it'll go out of the way I do at least yeah because it's what we like we like chaos and the unknown just talked about this yeah that's the thing is is that we're heroic adventurers right we're not we're not Sybarite laying on a beach although when you get the opportunity to do that like make sure you take it but that's that's not what that's not that's not the proper calling of the human soul right we're out there to conquer chaos and the unknown and it's in that we find meaning and that's better than the utopia that's what Dostoyevsky god bless his soul Dostoyevsky had that he was such a genius he had everything that was wrong with communism figured out even before it started amazing really like if you read the possessed or the devil's which I would highly recommend although it's a hard book to get into it takes about a hundred pages to really get get it get moving but Dostoyevsky talks his main character in that novel is a person who's again a very powerful person who's completely possessed by what's essentially the communist ideology and he's very effective at moving it forward and Dostoyevsky lays out brilliantly exactly the catastrophic consequences of that both personally and socially and he did this like thirty years before the Russian Revolution it's just it's uncanny I don't know where the hell that guy was from must have been his epilepsy you know so yeah I'm glad I got y'all excited him keep going here basically I used to use that you know it's kind of late that a lot of that comes from the left-wing this utopia we're going towards with the universal income and the AI and suddenly the whole populations can become insanely creative and with no incentives but it's not that utopia is not there it's not like this thing that hasn't happened yet we're in it we're in it this is the best thing ever and like all of humanity the Western civilization like oh my god putting the material sense I mean oh it's just toilet paper toilet paper it just happened anyway that's so serious like so we have this beautiful thing and people are trying to take it down at all cost and and now we go into the dark phase of my into my question here which is and it actually goes into Charlottesville had you know with with that with with the initial purpose of protecting the statue was a good thing I don't I'm not I don't know about Confederacy except for the big thing but honestly it's a it's a slippery slippery slope and the confused souls who in the bad make this darkened souls for sure not good they screwed up big-time the purpose behind it it's so important because it's going to be fought founding fathers next anyone who ever contributed to anything to Western civilization as we know it is already being it's already being done James Madison High School in the States it's getting renamed because some girls one of the students felt unsafe and so yeah this is a serious issue I wanted like I feel like we're really up against the wall now because now they found their Nazis man the Nazis are flooding the streets now so how do we how do we possibly you know kind of save our cakes you had to bring it up didn't you well having the right degenerated to the identity politics does not seem to be a positive solution so one of the things I would say is that like I understand why the identity politics that has been practiced so assiduously and so devastatingly by the left has been co-opted by the right I understand that but then here's what I would say to the people on the right who are playing that game if you play the game of your enemies and you win you win their game you don't win that's not victory you just become the most successful exponent of their pathology how is that a good thing it's a bad thing so what does that leave people as although as an alternative well I don't think that the Caucasians let's say should revert to being white I think that's a bad idea it's a dangerous idea and it's coming fast and I don't like to see that I think the whole group identity thing is seriously pathological I think we've made big mistakes in Canada I understand why at least to some degree in that respect and that large mistakes are being made all over the Western world where we're making you group identity the most important thing about you I think that's reprehensible I think it's devastating I think it's genocide 'el in its ultimate expression I think it will bring down our civilization if we pursue it we shouldn't be playing that game so what's the alternative you know I've thought for a long time about a political career really forever since I was like 12 really for a long time and I've always decided against it because it seemed to me that the proper level of analysis with regards to the solution of the problem that we're facing isn't political and that's why I think it's a mistake when what I'm doing gets politicized either by me or others I think that the way that you deal with this is to put yourself together I really believe that is that because I think that individual people are far more powerful they're certainly far more evil than they're willing to consider but that's also a sign of their unbelievable power so I think that what you do is you aim high and put yourself together and stay the hell away from the ideologues because they're hiding they're hiding behind a wall they're not able to come out and fight on their own behalf and so the way forward through the ideological mess and that's the lesson of Western culture is to place the individual at the place of paramount importance and to make the group identity emerge only when necessary and secondarily if ever and so you can do that you can do that now you can do that tomorrow like you can put your life together and again as I mentioned to the other young men who asked the question is you won't hurt anyone doing that right you pick up your goddamn responsibilities sort yourself oke fix up your family right and then you can be a force for good in the culture and if enough people do that the ideological mess will just evaporate it'll just disappear I think that's the way you show people the right path forward to is that you say well look um we would like we would like it so much if you could thrive as an individual drop your cult-like affiliation right step out of the shadows the demonic shadows you ideological possession and step forward as a fully developed person into the light do it by example that's your that's your best bet man so that's what it looks like to me I'm going to take one more question and then I'm going to there is a young man from Kentucky here Brian it's Brian here ok so I'm going to answer one more question and I'm going to let you take Mike okay all right good evening dr."

    "text": "for me right now and English is not my first language so bear with me I I would have many burning questions to ask you but I thought it was fair and necessary to pick one and it would be this one there are concepts that recur in your lectures with this one you only mentioned once in your early videos on Bill c16 about self-esteem you said you don't believe in the existence of self-esteem the way to teach children they're all special you think you boost their confidence but the only result is that some get a narcissistic the reason why I'm interested in that is about standing up for yourself and it is and when I try to you know do it yeah I see that rational argument facing rationality doesn't get the best result in negotiations that's why you learn how to be socialized by playing rough and tumble it's not an intellectual conversation that gets you socialized so I'm also reading that book suggested about by Stephen Hicks explaining of modernism yes I wasn't really familiar and I've been listening to a lot of talk to him later this week so that might be fun and I'm trying to read with fresh eyes because having it doctrine aided by you of course very critical and there's one more point that I have to agree with the postmodernist and that is the world seems to me as I observe it a place where powers are at play it's not rationality delete that so when I'm in a weak position and I want to fight back not to get resentful I find that it's not a rational argument that will get me there there's something else that I don't do and that I should be doing and I don't know what it is so you see the relation with self-esteem seems to me that people who think of themselves start in a better position in this game ok so ok ok great yeah alright so there's a lot in that question so the first thing is is there's a problem with the measurement of self-esteem and that actually matters because self-esteem is a psychological concept a scientific concept if you like and you have to get the measurement right and you can predict self-esteem almost perfectly by measuring someone's extraversion and subtracting from that their negative emotionality or neuroticism so it's actually just a combination of big five traits and so people who are extroverted who feel a lot of positive emotion and who are and who don't feel a lot of negative emotion score high on scales of self-esteem ok so conceptually it's a non-starter because you're not going to move people's levels of neuroticism let's say by trying to get them to feel good about themselves ok now having said that that doesn't mean that you shouldn't encourage people right now there's this psychologist named Jerome Kagan who's quite a great psychologist developmental psychologist I think he's emeritus at Harvard at the at the at the moment he studied temper mentally inhibited children you can so they're basically kids who are high in neuroticism probably low and extraversion and he found that if those chilled and you can identify them as early as six months right it's very very inculcated in their temperament he found that if you encouraged them in the world you could shift them into a more stable personality configuration and what you basically did was when they were manifesting signs of distress instead of encouraging them to withdraw and retreat which is what they might be attempting to do you encourage them to go out and explore so for example if you have a temper mentally inhibited child and you go to a playground and there's kids out there like you have an extroverted emotionally stable kid three years old as you put them on the ground their feet are already moving right like a puppy over water and you let them go and they just run to the to the kids and they're there and then you have to drag them away but if you have a temper mentally inhibited child the child will sort of stand around your legs and sort of peek out you know and then what you do is wait it out let them watch encourage them to move a little bit forward encourage them to take their steps out into the unknown and the strange land and don't let them withdraw like you can do it you have they're slower to warm up they'll warm up they'll habituate and if you continually expose your inhibited child to the things that make them anxious in measured doses then you can transform their psychophysiological temperament now you're probably not going to shift them way the hell out onto the extroverted emotionally stable end but you can make a big difference that's very different than making them feel good about themselves which is such a you need to curse you need to curse when you discuss that concept right so it isn't the improved their self-esteem it isn't how you feel about yourself right it's how you act effectively in the world and how you're trained to do that so okay now then you were talking about negotiation right and you said well don't you said something like don't people who feel good about themselves aren't they able to negotiate better and it's I know that's a poor paraphrase excuse me but negotiation is actually a practical issue to some degree like the first thing is that you have to figure out what you want because you were saying well it's not merely rational it's like yeah yeah that's for sure you have to bargain from a position of authority let's say not power Authority is a better word but you don't have authority unless you know what you're talking about and unless you can bring some unless you can bring some let's say force it's not that's not the right word you can negotiate without anyone unless you can say no and you can't say no unless you've set yourself up with alternatives so when you go to your boss and you negotiate for a raise you need to have the sort of CV that enables you to go find another job and you have to have your CV prepared and you have to have looked for another job and you have to be able to get one because then you can go in there and say I'm not as productive as I could be at my current level of remuneration it's not reflective of what I'm able to do and I want this and this is what will happen if you give me this this would be the good things that will happen and what do you think of that and the person is going to know even by the way that you hold yourself while you're having the discussion whether or not you're someone with options and you can't fake that well you can but it's not helpful like it just doesn't work for very many iterations you have to it's it's not rationally you're preparing yourself for battle that's what you're doing and you can't be weak when you prepare prepare yourself for battle because if the person says no I'm not giving you a raise which is exactly what they should say because what are they going to do just like sprinkle the money around you need to be able to say okay then there will be consequences that you don't like and that's what it means to say no to someone no means if you continue to push this things will happen that you don't like now in that case it'll be all be part and take my talents with me and if they don't care well then you're in the wrong business or you don't have any talents to begin with right which is so it in order to negotiate properly and then this is more difficult for people who are agreeable for example because there tend to be more conflict averse you have to put yourself in a position where you can you can push back as hard as you're going to be pushed on and that means you have to open your you have to open up your space of available options because otherwise the person says no one that's it you're done well you'll lose that it's it's as straightforward as that now with regards to the self-esteem part is practice on small things because you build the skills forget about the self-esteem it isn't about being confident or feeling confidence or any of that it's about knowing bloody well how to negotiate start with small things you know so you'll notice that there are things in your relationships in particular that aren't the way you want them to be and that you could see how could be improved it's like figure out how they can be improved negotiate with your partner make the incremental improvement keep doing that you'll get better and better at it and then you'll be able to go out and have a harder negotiation in the world so to set a skills there's an attitude behind it you know and it's easier for some people than others but fundamentally it's a set of skills no problem alright so now we have something interesting and I expected to close this off with the floor is yours dr."

    "text": "[Music] [Applause] hello everyone hello it's been a very strange day so I'm going to tell you about what happened and then I'll start the lecture so I got up this morning and uh started to put my together and then I tried to sign into my Gmail account and it said that it had been disabled because I violated the terms of service with Gmail and I thought well I didn't violate any terms of service that I know of now I set up a new YouTube channel yesterday called Jordan B Peterson clips and so we made some technical changes and so I thought maybe it had something to do with with that and I had been shout out of Google one other time years ago so when you get shut out like that there's a little form you can fill out and so I filled out the form and I said that I had been shut out and uh that I didn't know why and I sent it off and then I realized one of my staff members called me and said that she was locked out of the YouTube account and I thought oh yeah the YouTube account is hooked to the Gmail account so that meant that I couldn't get access to any of my YouTube videos they were still up and online but I couldn't get access to them I couldn't post last week's biblical lecture for for for example and so that was worrisome and made me suspicious and then about two hours later something like that I got an email from Google and they said that they had reviewed the my request to be reinstated and that I had violated Google's terms of agreement or terms of service and they weren't going to turn my account back on and I thought and they didn't say why they didn't say anything I got there was no warning whatsoever about any of this they didn't tell me why and they didn't say why in the email response and so I wrote them back and I said because they said I could I wrote them back and I said this might not be a good idea basically and you might want to think about it and then I tweeted tweeted what had happened right I took screenshots and I tweeted and I contacted a whole bunch of journalists because it turns out that I know a whole bunch of journalists and so and so then what happened then was that um I got a call from The Daily Caller in the United States I had done an interview with them last week which isn't posted yet and they interviewed me and within 20 minutes posted it online and so they have a fairly big audience and so that was good and then somebody phoned me from Ottawa and I did a live radio show about that and that was good and then a number of other journalists contacted me and I sent them the information but another one of my staff actually my son emailed me and he said look you should hold off because maybe there's still a mistake here and I thought yeah there might be it might be just a mistake but then why in the world did I email Google and they contacted and they said they would not reinstate it and they didn't provide me with any information so I contacted the other journalists and I said well you never know maybe this is just a mistake so let's hold off and then while I was about half an hour later while I was trying to get into my I use this AdWords account that's linked to Google I don't run ads on my videos but I need the AdWords account because it helps me add some little gadgets to the videos that I wouldn't otherwise be able to and I was I was playing with that the system came back online I thought well that's interesting and lots of people had emailed me and twittered me and some people within Google and some people elsewhere and they were doing whatever they were going to do to help me get all this material back up and running and so something worked my suspicions are that what worked was the publicity now so but maybe not you know and it's very weird being in this situation because there has been a number of recent episodes where these larger companies Facebook Google patreon not that it's a massive company but it's starting to become reasonably significant have decided on rather arbitrary grounds to shut down their users and this is very ominous to me partly because we've we've turned our Communications over to very large systems or very large systems have emerged to mediate our communication right I mean there's lots of benefit to it so you don't want to get too cynical about it but we're blind with regards to the policies that regulate the the the actions the regulatory actions of these large organizations and that's really a bad thing and something else is even more ominous really ominous you know it's highly probable that we're going to build political algorithms into our artificial intelligence and this sort of thing will be regulated by machines that no one understands and that's a really bad idea and that's a really likely possibility so anyways I was all confused about this I thought Jesus maybe I flew off the handle you know because I was sort of it was stressful man you know because I have like 150,000 emails in that account like that's a lot of emails and it's all my correspondence for the last 10 years you know so it's an archive as well as an ongoing email system I have a commercial email system that I just set up three weeks ago with like six different email addresses now to try to organize my correspondent so I wasn't completely unable to communicate but my calendar was gone and that's a bloody disaster because because like I've got things scheduled out forever and I don't remember what they are I can't even remember what I'm doing in a day so much less in a month but I thought maybe I flew off the handle and I was worried that I contacted the journalist too soon and you know but anyways it all worked out so then what happened well just as I was coming to this lecture I stepped outside and there was a little package outside luckily it wasn't a bomb there's a there's a package outside nice little package we looked my wife and I looked inside it and there was a couple of bottles of wine in there so that was nice and there was a little note and so I'm going to read you the little note because it's actually pretty interesting so so this person said that they had finally tackled the self-authoring suite so they seem to be happy about that but that's not so interesting except peripherally a friend on Twitter has contact with Google Engineers she said quote I spoke with some friends inside Google who offered to help and I did get contacted by quite a few people at Google who said that they had been you know watching my lectures and so on and were happy about what I was doing anyways I spoke with some friends inside Google who offered to help but they suggest he set up a backup plan the teams are feeling significant pressure from advocacy groups and quote I have at least four Google Engineers who offered to speak up on his behalf but they know the Team Dynamics and unfortunately especially YouTube is an sjw Cesspool I hope this information is useful to you it's like yeah it's kind of useful all right so that was that was part of what happened today and so anyways I still don't really understand it right because I don't know why it got shut down and I don't know if anything I did got it turned back on and I don't know the reasons for it and that's also rather ominous it seems to me that when I was thinking it through and was that you know I have a fairly what would you call it respectable YouTube following I don't know if you'd necessarily call it respectable it's fairly large YouTube following and it seems to me that it would have been appropriate for Google if they were going to shut down my account to tell me why I would think and also maybe look me up maybe especially after I emailed them and then maybe not to have emailed me back and said no we're not going to reinstate you but we're not going to tell you any reasons they didn't say they wouldn't tell me any reasons they just didn't tell me any reasons and then it also seems very strange to me that it just all of a sudden went back on after two hours and so well so I don't know what to make of that maybe more information will come to light over the next few days I hope that I didn't jump the gun but it's very a very peculiar set of circumstances I thought it was kind of amusing actually that the video that they stopped me from posting today was the last biblical lecture you wouldn't necessarily think that that would be the sort of thing that people would want to stop from being posted but um we're in very very strange times so that was my adventure for today and so I didn't you know I hate speakers who apologize to the crowd before they talk to them because you know if you're speaking to people and they've put all this effort into coming then you shouldn't tell them what a sorry and useless creature you are before you talk to them you know and ask for their forbearance and forgiveness it's like it's a little you're a little late for that but I'm still going to do that a little bit today because you know I wanted to spend all day preparing this lecture I mean I've prepared it a lot beforehand but that rattled me up a lot and so I didn't prepare as much as I could have anyways we'll stumble forward and see how it goes I I'm I'm I'm reasonably familiar with the stories now and so onward and upward so I'm going to reiterate this you know I've learned something I have this idea that it would be a good idea for young people and and older people citizens of the West let's say to learn more about their culture and their civilization right because it's a great civilization and it's it's it's taken a lot of work to put together but I don't think that we really know I mean I know a fair bit about it although I wouldn't consider myself nearly as educated as a person should be but I'm not too badly educated and but I tell you going through these biblical lectures verse by verse just makes me even more aware of how unbelievably ignorant I am you know and partly for two two reasons like one is because I've been using this biblehub.com place and I think I told you last week but I wanted to reiterate it because it's important it's so interesting the way that they've set it up because you can go through the biblical stories verse by verse and then for each verse there's a whole small font page of comment from multiple sources and so you know not only is the Bible hyper hyperlink in the way that I discussed in the first lecture with all the verses referring to not all the other verses but lots of them but it's un it's got its tendrils out into literature you know direct commentaries on the text but also all the all the literature that's been influenced by it so it's it's it's an unbelievably Central and core text and it's so interesting to read a book where every sentence has been commented on well really in volumes and then just to get a sense of that volume of material you know how much power brain power there's been put into this and and to also understand how Bloody ignorant like I'm so ignorant about this there's all this work and and it seems that we've left it to decay in the dust and it's a big mistake man it's a big mistake because the people who were writing these commentary it's like you know a lot of it's from the 14th and 15th and 16th century it's kind of archaic and it's it's some of it's outdated and some of it you wouldn't agree with but if you read all the commentaries side by side you know you get a pretty good blast of wisdom coming at you and like the thing about wisdom is it stops you from running face first into walls you know it's not just there to to so that you can talk to people at parties about what university you graduated from you know and it it's there because the the information is unbelievably useful you know one of the things that I've realized that I want to return to tonight because I've been thinking a lot about this idea of the Ark you know and I I think I mentioned to you last week that I'd figured out that there was this idea that Noah was perfect in his generations and that meant that he had set his family in order it wasn't just him but he had set his family in order and because of that when when the catastrophe came like it comes to everyone he was able to withstand it because he had the support of the people who were near and dear to him and that's really important when things come along to lay you low like if you're alone and and the flood comes it's like man goodbye to you if you've got 10 or 15 people supporting you in a tight Network you know and and your your inter relationships with them are pristine and you can tell them the truth and they can tell the truth back to you it's possible that you might be able to find that thin way that will preserve you when when when when you know the Terrible Things come knocking at your door and so there's this the the idea of the Ark is very very Concrete in Noah it's actually a structure that that he and habits you know it's a concretized almost like a child story and I'm not being cynical about that because there are some bloody brilliant child children's stories but you know it's really concretized but then Abraham comes along and instead of an ark there's a covenant right now it says in the story of Noah that Noah walked with God and and of course Abraham it isn't clear exactly that he's walking with God or before God which we'll get into later but you see I see this as part of the increasing psych psychologization of the sacred ideas that were acted out by archaic people so first of all it's concretized in the form of a a ship that actually sustains you when the floods come right it's it's very concrete imagery the sort of thing you might see in a movie but then with Abraham it turns into a psychological Covenant in some sense it's like a contractual agreement now it's a cont it's a contractual agreement between Abraham and God but but that doesn't really matter that I mean obviously it matters but it's that it's it's only it's only half of what's important about that the other half is that it's a contract and you know one of the things that you do with your ideal let's say is you establish a contract with it you also establish like a social contract with other people right that that's what keeps society organized and so there's this idea that emerges in the Abraham stories of a sacred contract and that has the same function as the arc and what it does because what happens in Abraham we'll see more of this today is that he you know God tells him to go forward into the world and we we talked about that last week and he does that he encounters famine and he encounters tyranny and he encounters powerful people who want to take from him what is his I mean God sends him out in the world but it's not like he has an easy ride of it it isn't easy at all it's as hard as it can be but there's this consistent emphasis in the text and I think it's something really worth attending to that if you maintain your contract which and that has that has to do with honesty and trust and truth and all of those things if you maintain your contract then you have a good possibility the best possible possibility of making your way through the catastrophy in the chaos and I I don't want to be naive about this you know when I read Jung and I started to understand the idea of the hero archetype you know the idea that the human being is a is a force a logos force that can stand up against chaos and catastrophe and tragedy and evil and Prevail I never did think that that meant that if you did stand up and and tell the truth that you would necessarily Prevail right it's not it's not it's not a magic trick it's your best bet that's the thing you don't have a better option and so and that's what's that's what that see the idea is emerging in in the abrahamic text it's like people are figuring this out that would be progressive revelation that's one way of thinking about it and you can think about that religious terms but you can also think about it as Humanity Consulting itself right each individual talking to themselves which is what we do when we when we think and each indiv idual communicating with every other individual and Gathering a body of wisdom that helps people or Orient themselves in the toughest conditions and it it's an incremental process and I think that I really do believe that that's speaking purely secularly I do believe that that's what manifests itself in the biblical stories right it's the dawning Enlightenment of mankind something like that as we start to understand the principles by which we have to live in order to orient ourselves properly in the world so and I also do believe and this is this is the thing that's the unspoken question is like you don't you don't have any idea how rich and fulfilling your life could be despite its tragedy and limitation if you stop doing the things that you know to be wrong it's a really Grand experiment and you know one of the things that God tells Abraham constantly as as the story progresses especially every time Abraham makes a sacrifice is God says walk with me and be perfect it's something like that and and so the injunction is well aim high establish this relationship with the highest thing that you can conceive of which you might as well do that because well what are you going to do establish a relationship with the most mediocre thing you can conceive of or you're going to establish a relationship with the lowest thing you can conceive of people do that and I wouldn't recommend it it's a really bad thing and there's a lot of pain associated with that and maybe you know there's there's pain that can expand into a world destroying Force down that route and there's absolutely no doubt about that so what is there something superstitious and foolish about attempting to establish a contractual relationship with the source of all being I mean I I I just don't see that as a as an erroneous conception and you know it's not necessary perhaps to get lost in the details we can argue forever about what God might or might not be but we could at least say that the concept of God is an embodiment of Humanity's highest ideal right we could at least agree on that and then you might say well is that real and the first thing I would say about that is ah there's a lot of things about the world we don't understand and the second thing I would say is it depends bloody well on what you mean by real that's for sure and that turns out to be a very complicated question so okay so we left Abram remember at the end last time he had just gone off to fight a bunch of kings and get his nephew back which seemed to be a pretty courageous act and so that that brought a story to an end and it's interesting I think what happens in The Narrative is that there's a story so Abraham is somewhere and he goes somewhere else right that's a story and he has Adventures along the way and those Adventures are usually the typical kind of Adventure which is a a rift in the structure of the story an exposure to a kind of chaos and Novelty and then a reconstitution of the of the mode of being so that's That's a classic story right you are somewhere you're a certain way you're moving forward something happens that you don't expect it blows you into pieces it introduces chaos right you you face the dragon you get the gold or maybe the bloody thing eats you and the story is over and then and then you get to where you're going but then the question is well what happens when you get to where you're going and that's a really important issue because one of the things that happens to people all the time in their life is that they get to where they're going and then they don't know what to do right so for example you graduate from University it's like okay story over who Are You Now who are you the next day and so so what happens is when you succeed then there's a success crisis and the success crisis is well I've run this story to its end now what and that's exactly what happens in in the abrahamic stories and they're punctuated by a a period of contemplation and sacrifice so every time an abrahamic story comes to its end then Abraham makes another sacrifice and communes with God and then he figures out what to do next and that seems that seems right it it seems psychologically right because what you should do when your story comes to an end when you've achieved what it is that you want to achieve or perhaps when you're in terribly Dire Straits but we won't talk about that at the moment when you've achieved what you need to achieve then the next question is okay well now I'm that person or I have that character what what do I need to do next and some of that is always well what do I need to give up now what do I need to let go of so I can move to the next Plateau right assuming that your life is a hopefully a a sequence of upward moving what would you call them it's like sopus except you're actually each time you climb up the mountain you get a little higher on the mountain it's something like that so it's SI with an optimistic bent and and and maybe if you push the rock up the mountain properly and let it roll down then and if you do that right then it's okay every time you roll it back up it's it's better in some sense I don't think that's unrealistic either and so Abraham goes and rescues his nephew from this this these T tyrannical Kings that's very brave and he doesn't take any reward for it because as far as he's concerned it's just a manifestation of the right thing and then he has another Vision after these things that's the battle the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision saying fear not Abram I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward and Abram said Lord God what will thou give me seeing I go childless and the steward of my house is this elier of Damascus and Abram said behold to me thou Hast given no seed and lo no one born one one born in my house is mine Heir and behold the word of the Lord came to him saying this shall not be thine Heir but he that shall come forth out of th own thine own bowels shall be thine hair and he brought him forth abroad and he said now look to heaven and tell the Stars if you're able to numble them number them and he said unto him so shall thy seed be and Abram believed in the Lord and he counted it to him for righteousness and he said unto him I am the Lord that brought thee out of er the chelis to give this land to you to inherit it and he said Lord God whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it and then he does this sacrifice take me an eer a heer of 3 years old and a she goat and a ram and a turtle do and a young pigeon and then God comes down and well Abraham goes into a trance that's what it appears to be in the story um and has a great Terror and then God Appears to him and I'll just review this commentary again this is from Joseph Benson and when the sun was going down that's about the time when you wash up for the evening and he's he's he's praying and waiting towards evening a deep sleep fell upon Abraham not a common sleep through weariness or carelessness but a Divine ecstasy that being wholly taken off from things sensible he might be wholly taken up with a contemplation of things spiritual very strange very very strange series of interpretations because it does seem that what happens to Abraham that he falls into some sort of revelatory trance and so um when as I've taken some pains to explain we don't really understand such things and and we can't rule out their existence because there's too much evidence that they do in fact occur uh perhaps it's a technology that we no longer possess that's one possibility perhaps we no longer know how to access these sorts of states of Consciousness it's certainly possible and lo a horror of great Darkness fell upon him this was designed to strike awe upon the spirit of Abram and to possess him with holy reverence holy fear prepares the soul for Holy Joy God humbles first and then lifts lifts up yeah well I think that's right too like you know one of the experiences I've had in my life fairly commonly in a variety of different ways this is especially true when I was paying a lot of attention to my dreams which I did for about 15 years I guess something like that now and then I would feel like I'd learned some things and had sort of Consolidated them and then before I went to sleep I'd think okay I'm ready to learn something else it's like and I didn't say that without trepidation and you because usually when you learn something you know it's not that Pleasant because you usually learn something about why you're wrong and the deeper the thing that you learn the more you learn about why you're wrong and there's a death that's associated with that because then you have to let that part of you that's wrong die and that's that's that's the sacrifice right and so you have to make a sacrif you have to be willing to make a sacrifice before you're going to learn something and the and perhaps your what you'll learn is in proportion to your willingness to make a sacrifice and I really do believe that I do believe that as well because I also think that if you commit to something that means that you don't do a bunch of other things right so that's the sacrifice of all those other things you commit to it and you set your SS on it if you really commit to it and you get the sacrifice right so to speak then the probability that that thing will be successful vastly increases and I think that that's also not a naive or or a naive way of thinking or a foolish way of thinking I my experience has been that that's the case and so back to the dream I mean I do think that we learn in trepidation and that most of the time if if you have to be laid low before the new revelation can make itself manifest and I think that's also what happens to people often in psychedelic experiences when they have a bad trip is they don't get through the bad part of it and maybe that's because there's so much mess in their lives now I'm speculating but it's informed speculation there's so much mess in their lives that the altered state of consciousness makes manifest that it's like a little trip through hell and but the mess is so complete and comprehensive and all pervading that there's no way they can get through it now if they could get through it and started to sort those things out then you know there would be perhaps a what would you call it a compensatory positive Revelation at the end but the first thing is if you want to learn something is that you're going to encounter well you have to figure out what's wrong before you you can figure out what wisdom you need next to guide yourself and that's no laughing matter right and um so I think that that's what it that's what this refers to I think that's the sort of psychological experience that that refers to I also think we built this a little bit into this into the future authoring program you know I read this really cool paper once reviewed by this guy named Jeffrey Gray jeffre gray wrote a book called The neuros pychology of anxiety man and that is a great book it is impossible to read it took me really it took me like 6 months to read it and the reason for that is that he reviewed about 3,000 papers and they were all neurological papers and and and heavy psychological SL biological papers he actually read them all and he understood them and he synthesized them and then he wrote this book about the synthesis and so and he's very very careful with terminology and so to read the book you have to understand brain anatomy and you have to understand neuro neuro pharmacology and you have to understand Animal Behavior Uh the whole literature on animal behavior and a whole whopping uh uh dose of human psychology and cybernetics it's like it's a vicious book but you really learn something when you read it if you go through it bit by bit like and it's it's it's had an overwhelming influence on psychology even among people who haven't read it which is most of the people who cite it by the way and so but he said he he he outlined this real cool study maybe it was a sequence of studies about how to motivate rats you know and rats are a lot like us you know in positive and negative ways and uh you know biochemically and and uh psycho pharmacologically they're very very similar and they have very complex social environments and you know they have hierarchies and they play and they laugh Jack PP Yak PP found out that rats laugh if you tickle them you could tickle them with like the end of a pencil eraser but you can't hear them laughing cuz they laugh ultrasonically like bats so you have to record it and then slow it down then you can hear them giggling away when you tickle them so so which is you know you think oh going to spend $50,000 on a study demonstrating that rats laugh and you think well wait a second wait a second that's a major league study you know because he's outlined a a ludic circuit that's a play circuit and Yak panks have discovered the play circuit in mammals that's a bloody big deal you know if you get that by like rubbing rats with a pencil eraser Well good for you so anyways so gray talked a lot about how to motivate a a rat and you might have heard about BF Skinner you know he used food pellets to motivate his rats but what you don't know about Skinner is that those rats were starved to three4 of their normal body weight so they would they would work for food man so skinners rats were kind of oversimplified but you can get rats to work for food they don't have to be that hungry you can get them to work for food and they'll do all sorts of things they'll press levers and and they'll open bar open doors and they'll solve problems and you know they'll do all sorts of things and one of the things you can do to kind of measure how much the rat is motivated is let's say you've run him through a maze and he knows there's some food at the end of the maze you can tie a little spring to his tail and see how hard he pulls when you open the door to the maze so that's because that's how much rat work the rat is willing to do so you can measure that or you can see how fast he skitters down the maze and you can get an estimate about the rat's motivation and so then you might say well how motivated is a hungry rat and the answer would be depends on how hungry he is but there's another answer it also depends on what's chasing him when he's going after the food so if you have a rat and you you have food over here and you waft in some cat odor rats hate cat odor and it's innate they never have to see or smell a cat to be absolutely petrified by cat odor so if you waft in some cat odor and then open the door that rat will Zoom to that food a lot faster than it will if it's just hungry so a rat running away from something that it doesn't want towards something that it does want is a very motivated rat and so one of the things we did with the future authoring program that's gerain to this idea of Terror because there's there's this idea in the Old Testament that the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom and it's a pretty harsh idea but but there's something really useful about it because one of the things you see with people all the time time is that they're maybe they're trying to stumble forward towards their ideal as poorly defined as it might be but then they're afraid right they're afraid about what they might encounter and that stops them because fear does stop people it freezes you like a prey animal and so people move ahead but then they get afraid and then they stop moving ahead and so and that's not so good because negative emotion is a really powerful motivator so we're more motivated by negative emotion than positive emotion quantitatively speaking quantitative quantitatively speaking you can measure that and that's I think because we can only be so happy but we can really be suffering and dead you know so we have to pay more attention to the negative and that's bad because the negative can stop you and then in my clinical practice you know I often talk to people who are trying to make a difficult life decision and and they they're weighing out the costs and the benefits of making the life decision you know and one of the things I always talk to them about is wait a second that's an incomplete analysis you have to weigh out the benefits and the costs of doing this and you have to weigh out the costs and benefits of not doing that not doing it and that's not the same as the zero that you assume that you're starting with right because to not make a decision also has a cost and sometimes the cost of not making a decision is far worse than the cost of making a decision even if the decision is risky and so one of the things you can derive from that and this is very useful I think is that this is also I think why it's so useful to contemplate your mortal so to speak is you're screwed no matter what you do you know and that actually frees you is that you you you have path a that has catastrophes and you have path B that has catastrophes and you don't get to have the no catastrophe path but you get to pick which one and that's really something because if you know that there's terrible risk associated with everything that you do and don't do then you can afford to take some risks because you're not you know and this is all within the arc metaphor I'm still making the case that despite the fact that your life is essentially catastrophic you can you can make a covenant with the highest ideal and that will take you through it the best way possible I'm I'm I'm still making that case so so then you think okay well I'm trying to make this decision I'm going to go try to do something difficult and isn't that terrifying and then you think yeah but wait a minute what's really terrifying is not doing it and then you think about the cost of not doing it so in the future authoring program we have people do this little meditative exercise which is okay just think about your insufficiencies by your own definition right the way that you don't do what you know you should do about the things that you do that you shouldn't do that you know you shouldn't do beyond a shadow of a doubt right there's some things like that and that that's bad habits and and poor aim and all of the resentment and hatred and aggression and unresolved conflicts and all those things that are dementing you and warping you and then think okay those things get the upper hand man they get get the upper hand and they take you the worst possible place you could go in the next 3 to 5 years what exactly does that look like and so you sketch all that out and you think hey I don't want to go there and so the next time that a Temptation comes up you think well it'd be a lot better for me if I didn't succumb to this temptation it's like that's kind of weak hey you'd look a little better if you didn't eat like a cheesecake a day or something like that you know that's that's something but it's not the same as um I'm going to have diabetes and I'm going to lose my damn leg in in 5 years if I don't get my eating under control that's motivating and so then the Temptation comes along and you think oh how about no seriously how about no not just because a a higher good would be obtained if I avoided it but because a a terrible catastrophe would be averted if I didn't and so well so you want to get your fear behind you right you want to get it behind you where it's pushing you forward instead of in front of you where it's stopping you and you get your fear behind you pushing your for you forward by actually thinking through the consequences of not putting your life together and the least of those is that you waste it and suffer right because you're going to suffer anyways man so you waste it and suffer that's a bad deal because maybe if you're going to suffer you could at least do something Noble and glorious and upright and powerful and honorable and admirable and helpful and and difficult you know that's just so much better and maybe that's good enough so that you think hey you know little offering it's basically worth it at least it's a way forward you know at least it's a way forward and he said unto Abram know of assurity that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs and Shall Serve those people and they'll afflick them for 400 years God he's hedging his bets here a lot right he says to Abraham well go out you know into the world and then he confronts him with a famine and he confronts him with a tyan and with powerful people he wants to take his wife and then he loses is his nephew and who he has a fight with then he has to go fight a war and now you know he's reconstituting this Covenant and God says yeah you're going to have a nation is going to come from you but they're going to be slaves to tyrants for like 400 years it's like he's not a great salesman exactly but but the thing about it is that the thing that I like about it is that it's realistic you know and you got to think too because who knows why is that the Bible exists or why people wrote it but you know if they're going to sell you something I don't know if this is the way to do it you know because unless you're a Salesman who's sophisticated beyond belief because you'd think that if it was just a matter of controlling the masses let's say which is one say Marxist interpretation of religion or or providing people with a primitive defense against death anxiety which is essentially the Freudian interpretation that you'd kind of make the deals that God cut with Abraham a little more on the positive and Polished side instead of making them a realistic offer constantly like they are that that's also that's that that's part of the reason I think it is reasonable to treat the Bible as literature it's it's more than literature it's something other than literature but you can treat it as literature and I think the reason that you can treat it as literature is because the characters are all complex including the character of of God himself is complex and sophisticated it's not one-sided and it's it's paradoxical and incomprehensible at times but I think good literature is like that because you know true Art here's something about true art this is something I learned from Yung it's so smart he was so smart so imagine that you inhabit the land that you know conceptually and practically and then imagine outside of that there's that massive space of things that you don't know and even outside of that there's the space of things that no one knows right so it's the known territory surrounded by the unknown that's the canonical archetypal landscape and the unknown manifests it itself to you and that's where new knowledge comes from but the question is how is that knowledge generated and it doesn't just leap from completely unknown to completely articulate in one move that isn't how it happens it has to pass through stages of analysis before it becomes articulable and the first stage of analysis as far as I can tell is that you act it out so if something really surprises you the first way that you react to it your category is actually embodied you like this that that's your first category it's not ceptual at all it's embodied and then maybe you start to like you're at home at night and you know something startles you and you freeze and then it's dark and then your imagination populates the darkness with whatever might be making the noise and that's the sequence it's like embodied response imaginative representation exploration articulation that's how information moves from the unknown to the known and and artists are the people who stand on that imagistic Frontier and they and they put themselves out into the unknown and they and they they take a piece of it and they and they transform it into some mythological image and they don't know what they're doing exactly because they're Guided by their intuition if they're real artists otherwise they're just propagandists they have to be contending with something that they don't understand and what they do is they make it more understandable you know and and then people gaze at those artworks or or they listen to the stories and then they start to become informed by them but they don't know how or why I was at the modern art museum museum of art and in New York I'm afraid I don't remember which one unfortunately but it I was in this amazing room you know it had all these Priceless paintings from the from the late Renaissance hanging in it you know each painting worth who knows a billion dollars maybe the Priceless painting so the room was it's a shrine and it was full of people from all over the world who were looking at these paintings you think well what the hell are these people doing coming to this room looking at these paintings like what what are they up to one of them was a of the Assumption of Mary right brilliantly composed and there was all these people looking at it and I thought what are they doing they don't know what that means like why are they looking at that painting why is it in this room why does it cost a billion dollars why is that painting worth so much and the answer to that is well we don't really know like it happened they're they're sacred objects in some sense and we gaze at them in ignorance and wonder and the reason for that is that the unknown shines through the Mattis and in partially articulated form and so well that's the role of Art and that's the role of artists you know and real artists real artists are contending with the unknown right and they're possessed by it they have a personality trait openness that makes them do that they can't even help it and I've had lots of creative people in my clinical practice and I can tell you the worst thing for Creative people is to not be creative because they just die and it because it's it's it's it's like maybe you're a tree with a few major branches you know that's your personality so if you're extroverted man you can't be cut off from people because you just wither and if you're agreeable you have to be in an intimate relationship or you die you know and if you're conscientious man and you and you're unemployed you're just going to eat yourself up because you have to have a duty and you have to carry a load because you just can't stand it otherwise and open people have to be creative they have to be because otherwise they die they don't have any vitality and so they're cursed with the necessity of putting a foot out into the unknown and making sense of it and then they're also cursed with the necessity of trying to make a living while they're doing that which they can't because you can't it's almost impossible to monetize creative creative action as many of you who are creative will no doubt find out it's very very frustrating it's not that creative action is without value right because the creative people are entrepreneurs and the creative people Revitalize cities and the creative people make things magnificent and beautiful you think about what's happened in Europe over the last Thousand Years say 2,000 years this amazing unbelievable collaboration to make things so beautiful that they're they're jaw-dropping when you walk into them and you think about the economic value of that right I mean I think it's it's either France or Spain that's the most visited country in the world it's one of those two I think there's more tourists in France than there are people most of the time and part of the reason for that is it's just so damn beautiful you just can't stand it and you think what's the economic value of that it's absolutely incalculable and what's interesting too is that you build that beauty in and then the farther away you get from it in time the more valuable it becomes right instead of decaying it has exactly the opposite effect its value magnifies and one of the things that I'm deeply ashamed of as a Canadian is that our sense of beauty is so underdeveloped we're so primitive it's not even primitive that's the wrong word because you know I don't know what it is it's it's it's second rate it's second rate at least it's Terror too because people are afraid of beauty but the idea that art is the conservatives really have a problem with this in particular because conservative people tend not to be that creative and it it's a Myster Myst by temperament it it's a mystery to me because they should be concerned with economic development and beauty is so unbelievable crucial to Economic Development it just yells out at you you know so anyway so that's what artists are doing and so one of the things I would say is buy a damn piece of art you know find one that really speaks to you and and buy a piece of art because you invite that into your life and it's it's a look out if you do it if it's a real piece of art because you'll also get a you know a little introduction to the artist and then that'll seep into your life and that'll change things like mad but it's really it's unbelievably worth it because it it opens your eyes to the domain of the Transcendent that's the right way of thinking about a real piece of art is a window into the Transcendent that's what it is and you need that in your life because you're finite and limited and bounded right by your ignorance and your lack of knowing and unless you can make a connection to the Transcendent then you don't have the strength to Prevail and that's part of the Covenant that's part of the Covenant with God and you can see that because you look at these magnificent Cathedrals that our civilization built over the centuries you know some those they're still bu building the sangria familia in in in uh Barcelona right and it's an amazing building I think it's going to take them like 300 years to build that you know people in the Middle Ages they'd start building a cathedral and they' think oh we'll be done this in 300 years you know you imagine the vision that it took to invest in something like that we we look at quarterly reports we can't think 300 years into the future to build something of that kind of remarkable remarkable what those Cathedrals are so they're they're perfect they're trees first right they're a forest right the gothic Cathedrals they're they're a forest and the sun is shining through the branches that's the stained glass and they're the perfect balance of light and structure because they're representing something about the proper structure of being which is something like the proper balance between light and structure and and they represent like the sacred tragedy of mankind that's why they're in the shape of a cross and they're open to the sky that's why they have a dome and they're full of gold so that it Glitters because that's like the city of God you know and and and you you can see that that integral to to our culture is the idea that beauty is one pathway towards God and it's and it's and if you can't find another pathway then why don't you use Beauty sure most of you do that with music because music is the one thing that modern people can't be cynical about thank God for that and being fascinated by music because of that it it speaks meaning to people right even nihilistic Punk Rockers are so damn engaged with their music that they can hardly stand it and you can knock on them and say look you know you're having a Transcendent religious experience and they'll just tell you to [ __ ] off because [Applause] that's because that's that's what punk rockers have to do but but that's still what's happening you know I mean it's still what's happening so okay so okay so I I got into all that because I was talking about about the Bible as literature you know and and and trying to and trying to lay out because we we need in our culture to justify the Arts and you have to I don't want to do that by talking about high culture talking about something abstract and event that's the wrong way to go about it this is vital you know like one of the things that's really interesting about the University of Toronto is that the the one side of the campus where we are is beautiful medieval Cathedral and the other side is God awful Factory and you know and and that and the thing is the attitude towards knowledge has paralleled that architectural transformation you know at one point the humanities let's say were a sacred Endeavor and and so was the art of Being educated in the university and that's turned into like mass factory and that's reflected in the architecture this isn't accidental none of this happens none of this happens by random chance you know it's not like there's a conspiracy or anything because there isn't but that doesn't mean that these things aren't Tangled together and the loss of Beauty in the universities is a catastrophe because without that beauty there's no call to higher being you know you this is also why you know i' I've mentioned to people that they should clean up their rooms that's become quite the internet meme but I'm really serious about it CU it's really hard to do that and I've been cleaning up my room by the way for about 4 months now because my life was thrown into such a catastrophe and and also we were renovating and so but it isn't just that you clean it up you also make it beautiful and be it's really hard to make something beautiful and it's really worthwhile and what's really cool is if you learn to make something beautiful even one thing if you can just make one thing in your life beautiful then you've establish a relationship with beauty and then you can start to expand that relationship with beauty out into into the world like into other elements of your life and that is so worthwhile it's just incredibly crazily worthwhile and that's an invitation to the Divine you know you have to be daring to do that and people are terrified of it people are terrified of color they paint their walls beige they're terrified of art they buy some mass-produced thing because they don't want anybody laughing at them for their lack of taste and they would get laughed at because they have no taste but you have to well it's right because what do you know right you have to develop it and so you're going to stumble along and make mistakes to begin with and you're going to show yourself because if you buy oh I think this is pretty and you know somebody comes over and goes what's up with you it's kind of hard on your self-esteem but but it's a St you're stumbling towards the right you're stumbling towards the kingdom of God that's what you're stumbling towards when you try to make an aesthetic decision and to put something in your life that's beautiful and it's unbelievably worthwhile to do that and you have to steer clear of the frauds and the con artists and all of that and art is full of that of course because it's difficult to distinguish between the real thing and the fraud but but it's unbelievably worthwhile and so back to literature I'm I'm I'm telling you this partly because I've been thinking a lot about the humanities and the Arts and practically speaking because I know that artistic types are also entrepreneurial types they're the same personality types and so it's very much worthwhile to make an economic and practical case for this sort of thing you study literature in the humanity so that you can familiarize yourself with the wisdom of our civilization man you should do that because people have been working on this thing for a long time and it's Rich Beyond comparison so why wouldn't you do that and you teach yourself to to read and you teach yourself to speak and you teach yourself to think and you teach yourself to communicate and I can tell you if you can read and think and and communicate you are absolutely 100% Unstoppable and that's another thing that's so interesting about Humanities education that's at the core of the University it's like there's nothing more economically valuable than teaching people how to articulate themselves and communicate because they can identify problems they can formulate solutions they can negotiate to consensus they they can negotiate on their own behalf or on the behalf of others it's like there's absolutely no downside to it except that there's responsibility that goes along with it but it doesn't matter because there's no escape from responsibility you can either take it voluntarily or you can take it involuntarily those those are your options but there aren't any other options and so we need to understand the role of art and literature and and stop thinking about it as an option it's not an option it's not an option what is it said man does not live by bread alone that's exactly right we live by Beauty we live by literature we live by Art and literally not metaphorically we cannot live without it because life is too dismal and and and tragic in the absence of the sublime so and ourselves we have to be Sharp so that we can survive properly and Orient the world properly and not destroy things including ourselves and so and so back to the Bible which I do think is a reasonable it's reasonably construed as a piece of literature because it's deep and because the people who wrote it had at least one foot in the unknowable and they're trying to communicate what they experienced in the unknowable to make it known and that's partly what we're trying to do in this series and what you're trying to do while you're listening and all of that and so good for that and also that Nation whom they Shall Serve I will judge and afterward they'll come out with great substance there'll be a period of tyranny you know and there's a psychological truth to that too one of the things I learned from Reading nche because you can learn a lot from Reading nche that's for sure he he talked about the Catholic church and you know n is often construed as a great critic of Christianity and and he certainly was but he was no casual critic in fact I think he was the sort of critic that you'd like to have as a friend because he was the sort of critic that said well here's the great things you've done and that you could keep doing but here's a bunch of really things that you did that you really should stop doing and he talked about the Catholic church and he said what the Catholic church had done to the European mind in particular was discipline it so that over a period of a, years 1300 years 1,400 years there was this rule that there was a a conceptual structure within which you had to interpret everything thing and what that did was turn the European educated European mind into a systematizing cognitive entity and that once that systematizing cognitive entity had been established then it could free itself from those underlying disciplinary structures and go off and do such things as produce the Scientific Revolution for example which required incredible systematic thinking and so n had this really interesting idea about freedom and he believed that slavery was an intermediary between the undeveloped individual and the free individual that you had to you had to submit yourself to some intense disciplinary process for some period of time in your life before you could develop any true freedom and so you think maybe you want to learn to play the piano it's like that's not going to be any fun for a really long period of time right because you're really bad at it and there's a million things you have to memorize and you have to stumble around like a well like an amateure and the same thing happens when kids learn how to read and some of them never get past that point and they never get to the point where they can enjoy reading but in order to put yourself together you have to put yourself in a vice and allow yourself to be constricted and mangled even by the the thing that enslaves you but the the goal should be that as a consequence of submitting to the discipline that you become disciplined and then once you become disciplined you can emerge from the disciplinary structure as someone who's free and that's something that's very much worth thinking about as well so that's Illustrated conceptually in this in this piece of literature let's say because what what the psychological meaning of what God tells Abraham is that all people all people are subject and I mean not equally obviously all people are subject to the Tyranny that precedes freedom and that that idea is is repeated over and over in the Old Testament it comes out most particularly in the story of Moses right because of course that's the story of movement from tyranny where do you go from a tyranny it's an absolute catastrophe you go from a Tyran into the desert you know where you starve it's harsh that's what happens in the in the story of Exodus and so that's so interesting too because what it means is that sometimes if you're going to move uphill the first thing that happens is you move downhill a lot and so if you want to escape from The Straits that bind you now you're not going to move forward and go up you're going to move forward and go down and that's another reason this is also something that Yung talked about a lot is that you know on the road to Enlightenment you encounter all the things that you don't want to encounter first like all the weaknesses of yourself all the realizations of the tyranny of the world and the catastrophe of Nature and all of that and so you step out of your encapsulation your ignorant encapsulation and it's immediate plummet into something that's a desert let's say where everything is chaotic and where you're wandering around without Direction a real catastrophe so it's you know because one of the things you might ask yourself is that if Enlightenment is possible then why aren't people enlightened because if it was just a matter matter of going from a good place to a better place it's like well man let's just get at it it's no it's no problem right why would we ever stop doing that but it seems not to be that it's that you're here and that's not good and it's unstable and you step out of it and it's like down down to where you don't want to be and you have to contend with that and then maybe you can start your struggle upward and so Abraham God is telling Abraham this and he's also telling him that it's okay it's rough though and now and thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace Thou shalt be buried in a good old age but in the fourth generation they shall come hither again that's the Israelites the the descendants of Abraham for the iniquity of the amorites is not yet full God is going to leave the tyrants alone until they've manifested their full tyranny for reasons that we don't fully understand and it came to pass that when the sun went down and it was dark Behold a smoking furnace and a burning lamp that passed between the pieces Al Albert Barn said the oven of smoke and lamp of flame symbolize the smoke of Destruction which we've already talked about this catastrophe of of the initial stages and the light of Salvation they're passing through the pieces of the victims and probably consuming them as an accepted sacrifice are the ratification of the Covenant on the part of God as the dividing and presenting of them were on the part of Abram in the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram saying unto thy seed I have given this land from the river of Egypt unto the Great River euphra IES now Sarai Abram's wife beam no children and she had a handmade an Egyptian whose name was Hagar so this is a big catastrophe for Abraham especially in those times and perhaps now as much although perhaps people aren't as conscious of it as they once were I mean for Abraham without a a biological son there was no there was no there was no vision forward into the future you know and I mean we don't really know what sort of time span over which these archaic people thought but the medieval people we already said could think 300 years into the future without without batting an eye and these people who were who were concerned about their descendants were obviously thinking about existence in a way that wasn't just focused on their immediate existence right they were thinking about well their children and their grandchildren maybe their great-grandchildren maybe the whole society that that stemmed out from them and that's that's smart you know one of the things I learned from PJ at least in part was that his idea of the equilibrated state which he thought about as partly part of the biological basis of the idea of moral progress it's something like that he was a very very smart PJ know he said that the the proper equilibrated state is one where imagine you have a family you got five people in it and you're doing what you want in in your family what's good for you but you're doing it in such a way so that the other four members of your family agree with what you do and that it also facilitates them doing what they want and what they should be doing and so it's a really tricky arrangement because it isn't just for you it's for you in a way that's for them and you could also see that that would be something that would be a multiplier right because if you have everyone working voluntarily towards the same common goal then you get a multiplying effect of that and then you might think well it's not just you and your family it's you and your family today and next week and next month the next year and 10 years from now so you have to take the time span into account and then it should be you and your family in a way that works well in society and then it should work well now and next week and next year and into the future it should be iterable right that's like sustainability it's something like the idea of sustainability and that's that's I would say that's a reasonable way of conceptualizing the holy city it's it's something like that you know if you're if you're trying to make it concrete it's like how should you live your life well let's say you live your life in a manner that justifies its limitation and tragedy that's a good start but then let's say that it does that in a way that also reduces the limitations and suffering of the people that you interact with and now and into the future well maybe there's a way to do that I mean a good negotiation does that right because if you're negotiating with someone like your wife for example what you want is for her to agree with the negotiation and one of the things that PJ said which I think was brilliant brilliant he said if you take an equilibrated system a family let's say and a dise equilibrated system so that would be one where let's say the father is a tyrant and everyone is operating under his Whip and you put them in a head-to-head competition the equilibrated system will outcompete the disequil system because the enforcement cost is such that it will slow the system down you know because you'll get resistances from the people inside the system they'll work it the system will be working at counter purposes to itself plus there's enforcement costs and so a tyranny cannot beat an equilibrated system and I was really excited to encounter that idea because when I encountered it I was also trying to figure out if there was some quantitative difference between the systems say of the Soviet Union and maest China and the systems of the West apart from just you know arbitrary World interpretation as the postmodern nihilists might have it if there was something fundamental at stake in the terrible cold war that we fought or if it was just a matter of opinion you know in the pedian take was that well roughly speaking is that the West Was An equilibrated system not perfectly equilibrated but reasonably equilibrated in that people were essentially even if they were slaves to some degree they were at least voluntary slaves instead of involuntary slaves and that that was better the system was actually technically better and not just as a matter of interpretation so that's a lovely thing to know and I think it's a really really solid really really solid idea I haven't been able to you know put crowbars under that idea and lift it up I think it's a good one so now Sarai Abram's wife baram no children so okay back to children well so one of what one of the things that's worth thinking about with regards to reading these old stories because we're so we're very arrogant modern people eh we look at these old stories and we think ah we've transcended all that Superstition it's like don't be so bloody sure about that these people weren't stupid and so there's there there are ways that they viewed the world that we don't have anymore and one of them seems to be this concern for Descendants because that just isn't part of our way of thinking we have very short-term way of thinking maybe it's it's not even one lifetime long it's certainly not multiple lifetimes long and it isn't clear to me at all that that's for the best and you know the the constant complaint that the environmentalists generate some of which is Justified and some of which is just anti- capitalist anti-patriarchal nonsense that should be cleared out of that entire conversation is that we need to take a longer View and consider more things in our purview when not when we act and like that's fair enough like do we really want an ocean that has nothing in it but jellyfish because that's really what we're we're doing and we're doing it very very rapidly and the data on that are very clear and so you know when you lift up your eyes and you make a connection with something that's Transcendent then that should bring more of the world within your purview and and maybe that's concern for the endless number of descendants that you might have you might think too well you know if you're a successful person if you have a successful family God only knows how many people you will be the father of right it's completely cuz you're a Nexus right all sorts of things have come together in the cosmos to produce you and then all things sorts of things manifest themselves from you you have no idea what your potential the potential consequences of your actions might be as they Cascade across time right you have no idea and so Abraham at least is concerned with these sorts of things and God seems to be concerned too because he promises Abraham that if he maintains the Covenant that the most important things that he needs will come to him and they're pretty serious about this so Sarai talks to Abram she's not very happy about the fact that she can't have children she says behold now the Lord hath restrained me from bearing I pray thee go in unto my maid it may be that I obtain children by her and Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai well that's not a very trivial thing I wouldn't think I don't imagine that that Sarah was Sarai was very happy about turning her maid over to her husband and potentially being usurped in the whole childbearing uh in the whole childbearing process not in the least but you know so it's also a major sacrifice on sarai's part there's no doubt about that and of course it's very difficult for us to talk about the ethics of the fact that Hagar was a more or less involuntary participant in this but that was the times absolutely the case and of course slavery and indentured servitude is the way of mankind except in very very in very very limited circumstances Carl Yung had something to say about that too which I really liked he said that part of the reason that modern people have it's not the only reason there's the Industrial Revolution obviously but part of the reason that modern people have been able to escape from the catastrophe of tyranny and slavery is because we've agreed to make ourselves our own slaves right so instead of owning a slave you own yourself in a sense and so you Trot yourself off to work and exploit yourself so that you can stay alive and maybe it's not something that you want to do but you've taken on the role of slave in some sense in relationship to your own Survival instead of forcing someone else to do it which is also something I think that's very Noble about the West is that we're willing to enslave ourselves as individuals and we're not we're not doing that to other people now we're doing it to some degree obviously because the society is imperfect but that's something that's very much worth thinking about so and Abram hearkened to the voice of Sarai and Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian after Abram had dwelt 10 years in the land of Canaan and gave her to her husband Abram to be his wife that's the other thing that's been so interesting about doing this one of the other things about doing this biblical series and it's one of the things that's so cool about Google um despite the fact that they cut off my account um you can find any piece of art that ever existed on Google and so that's great so you know when I'm trying to illustrate these these lectures I type in Abraham Renaissance and then like I get 200 Renaissance paintings it's so great and then I can look at them one of the other things that's so remarkable is that all of these the major themes of these stories have been illustrated by people of spectacular M mind mind expanding Talent you know there's just this endless array of well look at that I mean that's an amazing painting and so and there's and and of this there's there's dozens of paintings on on this theme and it's just another indication of how obsessed people you know this was the only book that existed for years and people were absolutely obsessed by it and produced all these amazing things from it and we're in danger of losing that and that's a big mistake because it's magnificent a little humility would go a long way towards restoring it and he went into unto Hagar and she conceived and when she saw that she had conceived her mistress was despised in her eyes so Hagar was successful and like that was a Hallmark of feminine success now and certainly then and so she started to Lord it over Sarai which seemed a little bit on the ungrateful side I would say because Sarai made a big sacrifice to allow Hagar to become Abram's wife and so a little bit of gratitude would have been in order I suppose at least that's how the story goes and Sarai said unto Abraham my wrong be upon thee I have given my maid into thy bosom and when she saw that she had conceived I was despised In Her Eyes the Lord judged between you and I and Abraham said unto Sarai Behold thy maid is in thine hand do to her as it pleases you and when Sarai dealt hardly with her Hagar fled from her face and the angel of the Lord found her by a fountain of water in the wilderness by the fountain in the way to Shure and he said Hagar sir's maid whence camest thou and withi wilt thou go and she said I flee from the face of my mistress Sarai and the angel of the Lord said return to thy mistress and submit under her hands and the angel said I will multiply your seed exceedingly that it shall not be numbered for multitude and the angel said behold thou art with child and th shall Thou shalt bear a son and shall shall call his name ishmail and Ishmael means God Hears by the way because the Lord hath heard thy Affliction and he'll be a wild man his hand will be against every man and every man's hand against him and he shall dwell in the presence of all his brothers and she she called the name of the Lord that spake unto her thou God seest me for she said have I also here looked after him that seeth me wherefore the W well was called beer laroy and that means the well who sees me and lives it's an interesting interlude because you know Abraham God has established this Covenant with Abraham and obviously things are going wrong in the household in a really serious way like a really serious way because well he's now had a child by another woman and that the two women are not getting along and one is beating the other because of her insubordination and and contempt and so she's so desperate she runs out into the desert where she's probably going to die and God comes along and says anyways to to to to Hagar that her son shall as well be the father of Nations and so that's partly a reflection back on the power of Abraham's Covenant right even though even though things are going terribly wrong locally let's say the fact that Abraham has made this overarching agreement with God means that all of these catastrophes are taking place within a bounded space within the ark we could say that's one way of looking at it and I I do think I do think that that's right because it seems to me that you know if everything falls apart around you there's there's a couple of things you're going to want you're going to want someone standing beside you that's for sure that you can trust you're going to want your family around you and you want going to want them to have your back and you're going to want know that you didn't do some godamn stupid thing to bring all hell down on yourself and if you're lacking any of those when that crisis comes there's a high probability it will flatten you and you won't be able to get up you know it does seem to me you can ask yourself this question when things collapse around you how much utility is knowledge of your own moral virtue it's bad enough to be late it's bad to be laid low but to be laid low and to know that you were the fault you were at fault for for it and worse the things that you did that you knew you did that were wrong brought you there then I think you have nothing to stand on in that situation and that's also the circumstances under which I think you're more more likely at least to be abandoned by people around you so given that you know that the catastrophe is coming right that the tragedy of life will strike you the question is well how do you fortify yourself against that and all obviously to some degree you do that by being materially sensible and these old people in the the test in the Old Testament these ancient people they weren't blind to the utility of having a good crop and some animals you know that that's a that's a integral part of their life to take care of themselves physically but they're also wise enough to know that there's an element of moral NE what would you call it there's a necessity for moral integration that defends you against the catastrophy of existence even more effectively than anything material and even more that this stability of the material things is more dependent on the Integrity of your spirit than the Integrity of your spirit is dependent on the material things and I think the evidence for that is actually quite clear I read read a very interesting book a while back called the wealth and poverty of Nations that was written by a Harvard Emeritus professor of history and one of the things that he claimed I liked it I thought it was very smart was that the only true natural resource is interpersonal trust if you can set up a society where people trust each other then it will instantly become rich and he used the example of Japan which is a very conscientious society and very rich Society but the Japanese have no natural resources right none to speak of and yet they're rich and then you have countries like the Soviet Russia and and much of South America where there's just natural resources that you know they're just like Venezuela it's just more natural resources than you know what to do with and the places are absolute catastrophes absolute catastrophes of cynicism and Corruption and so he attempted to document the relationship between default interpersonal trust among citizens within countries and their their productivity and their their GDP and their their standard of living and found a very very tight relationship and and I like that a lot and I've got a story about that quickly that I think is very interesting I'll tell you two stories one sort of generic um well I'll tell you one personal first so one day I lent my car to one of my graduate students and he took it to Montreal was this old Cadillac and uh he got it was a really bad rainstorm in Montreal and he was in one of the highways that are like set into the ground and there was like 6 Ines of water and he was turning a corner hit the brakes and skid it on the water and smacked it into the wall and on the corner of the of the bumper you know and so then he brought it back and he was very apologetic about it and and uh his name was Matt Shane tell you that because Matt might hear this and I can shame him a bit for doing this 20 years ago you know and uh he's a professor at uh the Ontario Institute of Technology I think now and quite a successful one but anyways he brought the car back and I went and got it evaluated for damages it was like $1,700 or something to repair it and or maybe more but it was almost as much as the car was worth I thought well I'm not going to do that so I went online and I typed in the part and uh if you do that you can get people to bid on sending you a used part from all over North America so that's kind of cool so there's all these junk dealers have got together and they have this you know network of communications so you put in the car part and then they send you a bid and so this guy said uh well I'll send you the bumper assembly which is the whole bumper and the lights for like 250 bucks and I thought yeah okay you you could do that that'd be good so then I said yes and then he called me up about half an hour later this guy from way down south he had a really deep sort of Mississippi accent he said wait a sec was that for the bumper or the bumper assembly and I said well it was for the bumper assembly he said Oh I thought it was for the bumper and then he said but that's okay I'll send it to you anyways I thought well that's pretty good so I said well thank you and then I hung up and then half an hour later he called me up again and he said look I just went out and looked at that bumper assembly and there's a plastic trim piece on the side and it has a scratch in it and I thought I better tell you that just in case you you didn't want it I thought wow that's so amazing it's like there's a miracle man it's like this guy he's somewhere in Miss Mississippi I'm never going to see him again ever I'm never going to have any contact with him like he made a bad deal right because the part was worth more than he decided to sell it to me for but he stuck with this deal and then he went over and above the Call of Duty he said well this part that I'm selling you to you for way less than it's worth is damaged so I thought I better tell you it's like man you got to recognize a miracle when you see one that was a miracle so I I said Hey look it's thanks for calling man so okay I can handle the scratchs send the part and he did and and I got the car fixed and forgave Matt and you know it had a happy ending so so that's trust right because I didn't know him from Adam and he's a primate full of snakes just like the rest of us and yet he was willing to simplify himself to the point where I could just take him absolutely at his word and that meant we could trade even though we were strangers it's like man do not underestimate the utility of that and then there's eBay so when eBay first started you know the idea was it's not going to work cuz you'll send me junk and I'll send you a check that bounces and that'll be the end of eBay right and so these escrow agents popped up so you could ensure your transaction with them was for like 10% of the transaction they would get the check and the goods and make sure that they were okay and then send them on or ensure the transaction but what happened was the escrow agents didn't make any money and the reason for that was no one cheated now you think about how amazing that is right you bring these people together across a whole continent they've never seen each other before they're never going to interact with each other again and this was before there were any reputation ratings on eBay and yet the default transaction was you describe your goods honestly including their flaws you set a reasonable price I decide to pay you ship the goods and I pay you and it works and what happened was that eBay produced It produced a tremendous amount of capital that was previously frozen so Frozen capital is when you've invested money in something but the thing is no longer useful to you so the money is just sitting there Frozen right so to speak and you can't get it Loose because well you've got a attic full of junk how are you going to get rid of that oh eBay and so all of a sudden all these things that were just junk became valuable and everybody got richer and none of that wouldn't would have happened without the Covenant that we established between each other that's predicated on trust and so you might say that trust is the currency and currency is trust because it's a promissary note right and if people lie that and the currency gets debased very very rapidly and so the economy runs on trust and so that's part of the overarching Covenant so Abraham makes this Covenant with God and he decides that he's going to aim high and live a good life and tell the truth and that puts this boundary around him it's like a Walled Garden it's like a Walled Garden and inside there there's all sorts of things that are Happ that are complex and difficult but outside there's a boundary and the boundary is well maybe things won't it's like God says After the flood he says I'll never send a flood again that's part of the story and so there's an intimation there that no matter how bad things get they won't get so bad that they'll be catastrophic but there's a but there's a coded to that which is that you have to maintain the Covenant and we don't know what that means you know because you know you think it's pretty obvious that if you treat people well if you really think about it and you're not being naively optimistic and like you know a nice good person with all the weakness that that that that that that uh that that Intimates if you're being hard-nosed and sensible you understand that if you treat people if you trust people that's an act of Courage if you're not naive right if you're naive it's an act of stupidity because you might get bit and you probably will and if you're naive and you get bit you will suffer for it it'll traumatize you but if you're not naive and you know you can get bit then you might ask well what should you do with people and the answer is you should trust them not because you're naive and not because they couldn't betray you and not because you don't know that they could betray you but because if you hold out your hand in trust then you're inviting the best part of that person to step forward and that won't happen unless you take that initial step and that's courage not naivity and so to trust someone once your eyes are open that's an act of courage and that opens up the world you know and you might say okay and so there's this idea in the story that you can withstand it a fair bit of the catastrophe of Life by establishing the proper Covenant and by acting in a trustworthy Manner and extending your hand to people properly and you might say well okay that's sensible I can understand how that would work and I can certainly see how the opposite wouldn't work because you know if I have to be absolutely terrified that you're going to betray me at every possible moment and we're in in a negotiation we're not going to get any work done man because I'm going to be figuring out what you're up to all the time and you're going to be figuring out what I'm up to all the time and we're just not going to get anywhere you'll come and say you're going to do something and I can just simplify you I can say you're going to do what you said you do I don't have to worry about you and then the same applies to me and then we can go do something and that's how we generate wealth so then you might say well if what's the ultimate limit of that you know like we know that there's corruption in our society that people betray each other and there's deceit and all of that and it causes things like the periodic collapse in 2008 which was complicated but was partly engendered by corruption like what would be the upside if we acted if we really determined to act honestly what do you think it is that people would be able to do with the world if we stopped acting in a corrupt manner I mean what what's the like what what is the upside do you think we could could could how far back could we push aging do you think if we hit it hard for 50 years could we triple our lifespan it wouldn't surprise me you know all these terrible diseases that beset the planet we could get rid of them there's no reason for hunger and starvation we make enough food it's like what would happen if we stopped acting badly how much better could things get well you start locally I think you start with yourself and you start with your family but you know there's intimations of the Divine there's intimations of the kingdom of God and the Covenant with God in the Old Testament it's like you think well we speak secularly you think well that's an unprovable assumption it's like well just hold on a sec what's the Assumption here exactly what is the upper end for Humanity I mean who's who's going to say right who's going to say especially in this day and age man there's so many things happening that you can't even comprehend them what could we do if we put all of our effort into it well you can experiment with that CU you can start in your own household you can start in your own room and you can make miracles happen in the confines of your own space there's no doubt about that all you have to do is try you'll see that that happens it h and people are writing to me and telling me that they're trying this and that that's exactly what's happening and so so we don't want to be too cynical about about where we might be headed and Hagar bore Abram a son Abram called his son's name which Hager bear Ishmael who is by tradition the forefather of several Arab Nations and of Muhammad himself and Abram was 4 score and6 years old when Hagar bear Ishmael to Abram so that's the end of another story and then so that section ends and then again we have an encounter between Abraham and God when Abraham was 90 years old and 9 99 years old the Lord appeared to him and said I the almighty God walk before me and be thou perfect Alexander McLaren who was a a Biblical commentator who lived in the early 19th century said this phrase walking before God is Not precisely Walking with God because that's what Noah did right he says it's rather that of an act of Life spent in continual consciousness of being named naked and opened before the eyes of him to have whom we have to give account I was pretty happy to stumble across that because it I mean I might have picked and chosen of course you never know that whether you do that but it does seem in keeping with the narrative strain of the chapter right because what what we've hypothesize so far is that God has called Abraham and said you know get out there in the world go go to where it's unknown go to where you're a stranger and get away from the familiar go out to the unknown establish yourself and great things will come but regardless of the proximal evidence great things will come of it and so I think that's what the walking before God refers to it's not like Abraham is acting in certainty there's no certainty here that that's the act of the leap of faith even because it does require a leap of faith for you to move into the world because the world is a catastrophe self-evidently the world is a catastrophe and so there's there's there's every reason for you to assume that you should just sit in your basement and hide from it but that's that's not it doesn't help it doesn't make make things better and the thing is perhaps you're not built for that you're not built to hide I don't think the people are built to hide I think it destroys them and so walking before God in some sense means that Abraham we could say is taking the lead he's the person that's going out there into the unknown God says well great things are going to happen but he's a little short on details that's for sure so the weight is still on Abraham and that's a good thing because it also that ennobles Abraham right that's the other thing that's so cool is that if God had just laid out the whole story and and and you know brushed the the the the branches from Abraham's path while he was walking forward well then there'd be nothing for Abraham to do there'd be no nobility in his own Pursuit and this is another thing that we don't understand very well it's a really tough thing to understand is like how much trouble would you want there not to be it's a weird question right because you want to have something to contend with you want to have something that that forces from you the best that you have and so you have to have real problems it's something like that would you dispense with all your real you could just lay down on a bed and have paum infused into your mouth you know if all your problems were solved and so maybe you want difficult problems that you can solve something like that because there's some I don't know what it is about it there's there's the overcoming and the and the growth that comes along with that there's something about the nobility of the Enterprise you certainly see that when you go about having children for example which is you know the psychological literature is quite clear if if you do momentto moment comparisons of people who have kids and people who don't have kids the people who don't have kids are happier and so psychologists who tend to get things wrong even when they make intelligent discoveries like that one immediately some of them jump to the conclusion that because happiness is the goal that well there's something about children that you know make you unhappy and that's not good it's like well wait a second that maybe that's the wrong metric it's like of course you're less happy once you have children because you have to worry about them you know my neighbor down the street who's very smart woman said to me once you can only be as happy as your unhappiest child and which I thought was really good you know that's really smart but then it isn't well if having children doesn't make you happy the answer isn't don't have children it's like don't be so stupid about being happy that's the answer it's because there's a nobility in the pursuit right and of course now you're responsible you know you have a new baby you think especially if you're a new parent you think what the hell is this and what am I going to do with it you know it's like and and then you're you're done for the rest of your life you never sleep properly again because you're going to be worried about this creature that you have to take care of but like what the hell good are you if you're not doing that or something else equally difficult because you just you just haven't been called out yet unless you take on a responsibility like that the idea that life is you know that happiness is the purpose of life it's like great for happiness man if it comes along you should be thrilled that it's visiting you but the notion that that's that that's what you should pursue that's that's the weakest possible notion first of all as soon as something terrible happens to you you're done it's like life is to be happy it's like well now you have cancer so how's that how's the happiness thing working out for you now or maybe it's not you you know maybe it's your father that has Alzheimer's disease or some damn thing and you know it's like it's a rare person that doesn't have some catastrophe one one person away from them it's like life is to be happy it's that's not right and and we can at least derive that from these stories that isn't what they say at all God's perfectly happy in the stories to Grant the people with whom he forms a covenant happiness and prosperity but there's never a word that that's the purpose the the rule is aim high and get your bloody act together that's the rule and establish this contractual Covenant with the ultimate ideal and that will see you through the catastrophes and that's a much more mature way of looking at life as far as I'm concerned because all you have to do is have your eyes half open and you see that the fundamental reality of life is tragedy and suffering there's that's inescapable the quest that doesn't mean that it it makes life unbearable or that it makes being something that shouldn't have existed right that isn't what it means but it means that you have to contend with it and you have to get ready and the willingness to adopt responsibility for yourself and for others is is the precondition for that and and then maybe if you do that properly then now and then you get some happiness you know you can sit at the end of a day and you have half an hour where your conscience is clear and there's nothing that you need to be doing and you can relax and think you know that that's all right things are okay and thank God for that and that's that's maybe where you get your happiness so yeah that's something that's growing up man obviously and and to not know that and to not be taught that like everyone should be taught that it's so obvious we should be taught that well and that's partly what these biblical stories do and I'll make my Covenant between me and thee and will multiply thee exceedingly and Abram fell on his face yeah and God talked with him saying as for me behold my Covenant is with thee and thou shalt be a father of many nations God says this a lot to Abram right it's almost like he has to remind him now and then and it's not surprising because he keeps going through these unbelievable Adventures you know that are really psychologically and socially shattering so it's a good thing that this reminder pops up in on fairly frequently but of course Abraham is also open to it and I think what does it mean you know I'll talk personally for a moment I guess so I've asked myself a lot of questions in the last eight months man I can tell you that and I'm still asking myself a lot of questions and I've been conferring with a lot of people because I had lots of people who were helping me negotiate whatever the hell this is that's happening and you know I could ask them how I was doing and they would tell me a bunch of of things I was doing wrong and some things I was doing right and I could listen to them I was asking questions all the time about how the hell I should manage this properly and you know what what I was trying to do and what seemed to serve me properly was to figure out how to do it correctly that was the issue it's like I didn't really care what happened and I guess I really don't care what happens but I do care if I do it correctly because I don't want to screw it up I don't want to screw things up and that seems to be a reasonable goal for people I mean wouldn't you like that as a goal that you don't screw things up because you can't control too you know your life isn't fully under your control by any stretch of the imagination but it might be nice to to not have your conscience eating at you saying look you know you had a big opportunity there and you mucked it up CU you're weak and blind and you didn't listen that's no good the C the catastrophy is bad enough as I said without you being the bloody source of it and so well that's Abram falling on his face I guess and also communing with God it's like you you don't he wants to get it right he wants to get it right and there's these these things that beckon and promise but but it's it's it's bloody easy to make a catastrophic mistake and you'll do that in your life you know and and maybe humility is one of the things that can prevent that because you can look and you can think okay what am I doing wrong what am I doing wrong what can I do better how can I do this properly and then maybe you know you get you get you get the intimation of the proper way to move forward and maybe that's what protects you when things are chaotic and and in strife and who knows what that's worth neither shall thy name anymore be called Abraham which means High King if I remember correctly but thy name shall be Abraham for a father of many nations have I made thee Oh yes Abraham High father look at that that Abraham means father of a multitude and I will make thee exceedingly fruitful and I will make nations of thee productive right productive and that seems to be something that's that's good to be I mean like one of the things that I've thought about deeply I thought deeply about death and the death of my family members and about funerals and I thought about it partly because I had this weird experience once that I think I told you about where I took one of my clients to see an EMB bombing which was a very strange experience and I had a chance to talk to the funeral director you know cuz they have weird jobs you know and there's this idea well the Freudian idea that people suffer from this terrible death anxiety and there's a whole line of social psychological theory theorizing called Terror management Theory that's predicated on the idea that we defend ourselves against death anxiety with our belief systems and like it's a pop it's Ernest Becker's idea he wrote the denial of death which is a great book but there's a weakness in it because you see some people who aren't like that you know like emergency room nurses aren't like that and paliative Care nurses aren't like that my my sister-in-law is a Paleo of care nurse that's a hard job right because you go in there you're caring for people you have and they're in pain they're on their last legs you're trying to make them comfortable and you have a relationship with them because how the hell are you going to make them comfortable if you don't and then they go and die on you and that just happens that's what happens every day right and what's weird is that people can be paliative care nurses it's like how do you figure that out because people can actually thrive in the face of death strangely enough and like these Funeral Parlor directors they were interested to talk to because that's all they do right they just deal with they deal with death and grief all the time and it was very interesting talking to them because I talked to two of them they found their job extremely meaningful and I asked them well you know does that what does that do to your life you know you're saturated with death and suffering and there and this is the same answer that I got from the paliative care nurses that it doesn't undermine your life it enriches it now who would guess that right I mean what what the hell that just doesn't make any sense at all but what it does is speak to human possibility because God only knows how tough you are you know I mean if you read history and you read about what people have done you think wow we're pretty tough people are I read uh there was a shipwreck in the Antarctica 100 years ago or so and I read the the story it was an autobiography if I remember correctly of the of the captain I might be wrong about that but I've got the basic story right well they had a shipwreck in the Antarctica was then they were there for a whole year in the Antarctica you know and none of them died not one he didn't lose a single man not one he kept them morale high and then they took this boat that was on the ship and they crossed like 400 miles of the roughest ocean the roughest frigid ocean in the world right you don't go in that ocean and then they went to an island and they walked across the island across these mountains that no one else has ever climbed since and they went to the city on the other side of the island and they got a boat and they went and rescued their compatriots and everyone survived it's like endurance is the name of the book you read that book man you think wow people are really tough you know and if and it's it's ridiculous so who knows how tough you are and maybe you find out by going out to find out how tough you are right so you take on a challenge one that you think you can Master just that's just a bit beyond your grasp and you master it and then you're a little tougher and you think hey that worked out pretty well and so then you're more of a monster and then you go out and you find another challenge that's even bigger and you think well maybe I can do that too and all of a sudden you can and you get a little bit bigger and God only knows what the limit is of you and you find out by pushing yourself against the world and of course that's what Abraham is doing and so see we're very pessimistic us modern people you know we're pessimistic about Humanity that's for sure dismal wretched Planet destroying cancer on the planet right as the club of Rome described us so pleasantly back in the 1960s you know and and I don't know maybe we're ashamed of the Cold War maybe we're ashamed of all the destruction in the 20th century and the hydrogen bomb and and the you know the continuing catastrophes of our societies and and we're deeply ashamed of that and ashamed of ourselves personally but it's a hell of a thing to you know call us a cancer on the planet there's just no excuse for that because what you do with cancer is eradicate it and I don't think that that's a very Noble motive personally and I think it says a lot about the people who would use such phraseology that they would dare to conceptualize Humanity in that manner but you know it would be nice if we could be optimistic and I think again the problem with being optimistic is that it's naive so then the question is is there an optimism that's not naive and I think there is and the optimism that's not naive isn't just a a a visualization of how strong people can be so one of the things that I I tell people I've told my students in my class in maps of meeting here's a goal you want to be the person at the funeral of your father that everyone can rely on how would that be you want to be the person who's broken and and and useless and adding to the misery in the corner and look I'm not making light of people's grief you know I'm understand grief but who do you want to be when there's a crisis right do you want to be the person that everyone can turn to for strength it's like why the hell not why not that as a goal that'd be a good goal because then if there's a crisis then there will be it won't be such a bloody crisis because there'll be someone there that can deal with it you know so when I went and talked to these people at the funeral home I envisioned that I thought okay well this is something you have to contend with if you're going to be alive and adult you have to contend with death and suffering and you have to be ready for it and you have to be there for the person because that's all they're going to have and so there's a goal man and in this time of nihilism you know it's what's the point of life people ask and and they're taught that at universities what's the point of life everything's interpretation Humanity's a cancer on the planet you know well how about no how about not that how about that there's something to [Applause] and I will establish my Covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an Everlasting Covenant to be a god unto thee and to thy seed after thee and I will give unto thee and to thy seed seed after thee the land wherein thou art a stranger all of the land of Canaan because of course Abraham went out into the land of strangers right but it says that he'll Master If he if he keeps his Covenant he'll Master the land of strangers that's a wonderful thing to know and I think a true thing you know because if you're dealing with strangers I've dealt with lots of strange people in my life but I'm a clinical psychologist and that isn't to say that everyone that I've dealt with was strange because that's not the case but I have encountered some very strange people and you know the way to deal with strange people is to you never lie to a strange person that's the thing especially if they're paranoid you never lie to someone who's paranoid it it will come back to bite you and if you're in an extreme situation with someone who's very unpredictable the only thing you have that works is the truth that works I'll tell you a little story this is in my book so I had this landlord in Montreal he lived next door to me he was an ex hell's Angel's biker he'd spent a lot of time in prison and his wife had borderline personality disorder and she committed suicide when I lived there and he was a rough guy and he was a kqu he spoke jeel which I could hardly understand and uh he didn't really know what to make of me and I didn't really know what to make of him um but we got along you know and I was very careful talking to him as as you might imagine but but I I was it was very and we we went over my wife and I went over there and we had spaghetti dinner one night and we sort of communicated and I bought a poster from him because he made these wooden posters that had neon on them and that's how he made a living he'd kind of trained himself to be a bit of an Electronics guy and so he made these things and he was trying to quit drinking and we talked about that he was a lot older than me he was like 20 years older than me I was about 25 at this point and uh we got along pretty well but every now and then he'd go out and get and drink and he could really drink you know like he was one of these guys who could drink like 60 beer and you think well no one can drink that much and you're wrong I studied alcohol for like 10 years some of my subjects fathers drank 40 o of vodka a day and had been doing it for 20 years so you can drink a lot and he could drink a lot and what would happen he was trying to not drink but he'd go out and go on a binge and then he'd be gone for like three days and he'd drink up all his money and then we'd hear him out in the backyard howling at the moon with this little little ugly dog he had you know and he'd howl and the dog would howl and he'd howl and the dog would howl and and it was rather unsettling and made my wife nervous and and uh but worse you know now and then he'd come to the door at like 3 in the morning e and he'd knock on the door and he'd be standing there and I don't know how much experience you've had with rough guys who are alcoholic and who are drunk but it's they can be upright and unconscious at the same time and so that was the state that he was in you know he'd be just swaying and he'd ask me if I would like to buy his toaster or his microwave because he needed some money to keep drinking and you know I didn't really want to buy his toaster or his microwave but when the ex Hell's Angel je all speaking 60 beard drunk kqu biker shows up at your door at 3:00 in the morning and offers you to sell offers to sell you his microwave the easiest thing is to say I really need a microwave so so you know I bought the microwave and toaster and some other things but then but then my wife talked to me and she liked my landlord you know even though she was afraid of him she liked him and and she said you can't buy any more any more appliances because it's not good for him and I thought huh that's an interesting problem you know so what the hell am I going to do about this because no I don't want to buy your microwave just doesn't seem to be the right answer at 3 in the morning so so one time he took me out on his 750 Honda and he put me on the back of it he wanted to show me his layer I guess his Hangouts and I got his wife's helmet on but it didn't fit it just sit on the top of my head and he said I got on the bike and he said if the cops chase us we're not stopping and then and then away we went and we went to these like these bars downtown on S law they were very rough places and he got into like four fights that night because he was a rough guy you know and these kind of punk guys would come up to him and sort of challenge him and act stupidly around him and he was very skeptical and if you were acting stupidly around him for any length of time he' just hid you because he felt that that's what you deserved and perhaps he was right you know so so I had firsthand opportunity to observe him so anyways he sure enough about a week or two after we had this conversation he showed up at the door knock knock knock you know open the door and he was standing there you know with his eyes kind of half closed and he was swaying and he had I don't remember what the appliance was this time but he wanted to sell it to me and I said I'm not Paul I can't buy this I'm not going to buy this because I know you're trying to quit drinking and if I give you this money then you're going to go and drink it up and it's not going to be good for you and what else did I tell him I think I told him as well that this whole thing of him coming to my house at like 2 in the morning was scaring my wife who he liked and that it had to stop and believe me man I I was thinking about what I was saying cuz he was watching me like a rough guy watches you and a rough guy watches you like this he thinks if you say one thing that indicates contempt you're going to bloody well pay for it and so I was finding my words like you know I was crossing a swamp and trying to look for the for the Rocks underneath the surface and I said what I had to say very very carefully and he looked at me for about 15 seconds and that's a long time to be looked at at 3:00 in the morning and he left and he never came back to sell me anything again and we got along fine but that's a good illustration of this issue with regards to truth and success in The Strange Land because I was in The Strange Land when I was talking to my neighbor my landlord then and I managed to say what was true carefully enough so despite the fact that he was a very violent person and that he was a very intoxicated person and that he had every reason to be suspicious of me and we couldn't communicate very well and I didn't do what he wanted that he took it and he left and there was no problem and life went on just fine after that and so we don't want to underestimate the utility of establishing this bounded relationship with the ideal and attempting to live with some nobility in truth while aiming at the highest ideal there's nothing about that that's anything but strengthening and positive and it's exactly what you need to set against the catastrophe and uncertainty of life and as far as I can tell that's what these abrahamic stories are attempting to communicate so we'll stop there thank [Applause] you I have to make an announcement I'm going to do a talk August 22nd I think not sure of the date but I'll I'll find out with Gad sad from Concordia and so and with a with an ex social worker named Serena Singh and with faith Goldie I think faith is going to be there as well so the tickets for that will go on sale I'm not hosting this someone else is dealing with it but the tickets for that will go on sale within approximately a week and I'll post that on my I'll probably make an announcement on YouTube but I'll twit Twitter it Twitter it and all of that so and I think I mentioned to you guys last week that I would like to continue this series but I think I'll do it once a month and I'll try to do it in this theater but I haven't got word from the people who run the theater that's the university whether or

    "text": "so um you're all welcome to attend that so that's 1:42 Cumberland Street okay so that's it for announcements I guess and then let's say for questions yes I was going to let you ask the first question last time wasn't I okay so I will do that and so let's make sure again everybody to speak into the mic clearly so that the YouTube people can hear and uh you know the ghostly YouTube people and and so go ahead question I was quite impressed with your presentation last week and uh I wasn't quite sure where it was going at one point and would neither neither was sry and that's okay because at one point I I listened and I thought what you basically were talking about this is what I saw you were embodying mind body and spirit and bringing it all together as one and you touch on it a bit tonight when you when you talk about truth this is where we need to go right and I know you say be positive and all that and yeah that's right I agree it's scary what's going on right now however we have the power to stay in the positive what you talked about last week you talked about using our intuition which I consider our higher self using Consciousness and you made reference I can't remember exactly what you what you said but you held your hand and uh you talked about emotions and bringing intellect on top and when you said emotions everything just lit up for me because I'm thinking that's our heart chakra that's what combines our lower self our physical being the material stuff all the all the stuff that doesn't really motivate us with our higher self and when when you talked about emotion I want to talk about the emotion of love and I find so many people are terrified it's a four-letter word I know but it doesn't have to be bad okay so I remember why when I talked to you last week why I wanted you to ask this question so okay so I've talked a lot in this lecture series about truth and know I think there's a battle in the biblical stories all the way through between love and truth in terms of their Primacy and so So and I've concentrated a lot on truth in my own thinking but I and it's hard to talk about love because it's a word that people have mouth to death you know as soon as you start talking about love then people should just go into a different room and and not listen to you you know because it it gets it can get sappy and new Agy just like that and and I don't like that at all but but it's still something that has to be contended with and I think so I've been trying to conceptualize let's say what this Covenant might might con Institute and I think the love part so here's this so you know there's this book by Gira called fa and it's in two volumes f one and F two logically enough one was written much later than the other and Fa basically sells the soul to the devil for for knowledge and the devil in FA is mephistophiles and mephistophiles is quite a well-developed character and Gira has mephesto say what he's about which is really quite cool so it's like the adversary of the world evil itself gets a chance to speak and make its case and Gira thought this was so important that he actually had mephistophiles announce himself once in FA one and then using the same words you know phrased differently again in in part two and it really struck me it really struck me and so what mephistophiles says is that the world is such a Charter House of suffering and destruction that it would be better if it never existed and so that what he's working to is to bring existence to an end because it is not justified by its suffering it's like that's it's an argument very similar to the argument that made by Ivan cam camarat of thank you thank Russians e you can't pronounce them or live with them you can't but he basically he's an atheist and does a very good job of detailing out The Atheist argument or maybe an anti-theist argument and he's arguing with his his brother alosa who's a mon monastic noviciate who's a very good guy but not an intellect Ivan's an intellect and a very powerful one and he basically tells alosha that the all of the cosmos isn't worth the suffering of one child he tells this story about this and this dovi took this from a newspaper about this parents that locked their four-year-old daughter in an ouse overnight and she screamed about it until she froze to death and so dovi used that argument he tied that into Ivan's anti-theist argument against elosha it's very very powerful argument the brothers katsov is an absolutely mindboggling amazing book I would highly recommend it um and so that's the meilan perspective mopan perspection is perspective is that being itself is so corrupt that it shouldn't exist so then you think okay well that fair enough that's a decent argument it's understandable but the problem comes when you try to implement that and what happens when you implement it as far as I can tell you adopt that me meilan attitude of bitterness and resentment and destruction is that you make all the suffering that you're complaining about far worse I think that's what happened at the base of things in the 20th century is that there was a powerful movement among human Humanity to bring being itself to a halt you know what culminated in the development of the hydrogen bomb and and the high probability for many at many periods of time that we were going to do something permanent and fatal which seems like a bad idea it seems like a bad idea so what's the opposite of the mephistophelian attitude and I think the opposite of that is what's presented in the biblical stories in the guise of love and that is the wish that things would be good it's something like that that's what love is I think is that it's the attempt to orient yourself towards making things better and it it's predicated on something like a deep appreciation for being def despite its suffering and deficiencies and maybe a decision that you're going to act to bring about things to move things towards the good and I think that's the thing that sets the parameters of the of the aim it's it's the opposite of the mephistophelian attitude it's like to work towards the betterment of being because you've decided that you're going to open your heart to existence something like that and it's within that framework that truth takes place I think because truth has to serve something it can can serve truth but it has to be bounded inside something and I think that that's what it's bounded inside so what I what I was going to refer to with that was um David Hawkins wrote power versus force and he put it on a quantifiable scale all different emotions he called it Consciousness and he put love at 528 Hertz he put shame at 20 I'm not sure if I've got these 100% right um guilt I think at 30 fear at 50 and it shows you how far the people who are really knocked down have to get to love and I'm thinking if we could quantify love on a term it means different things to everybody and rightly so but can we get to that frequency and if you look at the sesia notes you know the musical notes have you I'm I'm I'm afraid I'm G to I'm going to ask you to stop if you would because I should I should go to another question if you thank you very much okay let's so you've been an educator through the rise of the smartphone and my question basically relates to procrastination and task delay needless task delay specifically and given the unprecedented level of distraction that we have in today's world I just wanted to get your perspective from a psychological standpoint on other than cleaning your damn room what would you suggest to a student who's looking to overcome these things well I think with any let's call it addictive process I mean email is powerfully addictive right partly it's it's a slot machine and and I mean that technically so when you pull it's that's a variable ratio reinforcement schedule if I remember correctly and it's very addictive because if you pull on the slot machine arm enough you will win and you never know which pull will reward you and so not only is that addictive it's very hard to extinguish that and so emails like that because there's always something beckoning and now and then it's a jackpot and social media is like that because you know people are posting interesting things and so well how do you overcome an addictive process and partly you do it by replacing it with something better right so when people study drug and alcohol use they they often make an elementary mistake which is to try to figure out why people use drugs and alcohol that's that's not a smart thing to wonder we know why people use cocaine cocaine directly stimulates the systems that produce positive emotion it's like so there's no mystery there the mystery with cocaine is very very simple why don't people take cocaine all the time until they die that's the mystery really because you can get isolated rats to do that so and and for some people alcohol has the same kind of effect except it's mediated by op but often what people have to do to get themselves out of an addictive process is to find something better to do to replace it and so I would say the problem with the gadgets and I mean they're amazing things is that they interfere with they approximately interfere with medium to long-term goals I would say and so I think the first thing you have to do to bring them under control is figure out what it is that their use is interfering with it has to be something important right so you think well I I I want want to do something important what is that well could be personal maybe you want to have a relationship you want to get married you want to have kids you want to have a career that's meaningful you know you want to have a life you you want to have an abrahamic adventure and be the father of Nations let's say well you can't be ratting away on your cell phone and doing that and so I think I think part of it is to set your sights high and and make a plan and figure out who you could be and see if obsessive you utilization of smartphone fits into that vision of nobility and it will partly because they're they're unbelievably powerful communication devices but so so often it's it's for lack of something better to do and it also interferes so that's about the best I can do with that hello Dr Peterson so uh you've been um you you've been talking with some of the conservative uh candidates for leadership this year um I know you talked with most all of them right not all of them but a number of them you you talked with Andrew though right yes I did yeah so um so something very interesting uh popped up in my Facebook feed so it was a ad for the conservative party and um it was suggesting that we uh cut you cut uh funding to public universities that don't support free speech and yeah that was probably my fault yeah see precisely because because this is something you say in some of your Wilder moments you suggest that we should cut the universities funding by 25% and let them battle it out for the remains and he's taken that to you know his his platform but now what you're doing is uh well you're well one of the things you're doing is you've created this website um that identifies uh the postmodern lexicon and helps people um uh distinguish between uh postmodern courses and not and so people don't take them um or take them if they want yeah yeah so that's it's it'd be interesting to know like what sort of malevolent postmodernists just study you meticulously and try to use all your uh knowledge of it anyway so but but what you've said though you said that um what we need to do is starve it out from the source yeah okay so I yeah that look so yeah I do I know where you're going so about two weeks ago 3 weeks ago I went up to Northern saskat and my parents have a cottage up there it's way the hell out in the middle of nowhere and uh there's no cell phone although we do have internet now which is you know probably bad and good but anyways I got to take a bit of a break which was good because I haven't really been able to think because you know more broadly about say what I'm doing because who the hell I don't know what the hell I'm doing exactly this is a this is all very strange and but but one thing I thought about I was out on the lake I was canoeing around and I I thought I'd thought about war you know because I was very irritated I'm very irritated about what's happened to the universities and there's a hint of malevolence about it and I I'm not a fan of ideological possession and I've been set back up on my heels a lot over the last eight months by the the onslaught of what emerged when I said that there was words I wouldn't say and so it's put me into a defensive posture let's say and I had been thinking in terms of War metaphors you know like this is a Battleground and that there's a war going on an ideological war and I do believe that that's true but then I was reading and I I did this partly for this course I was reading The Sermon on the Mount and one of the things it says is resist not evil and I don't know what to make of that line and so I was talking to a bunch of people about it reading about it a lot and trying to figure out what it meant and partly what it means is don't waste time right because when you're fighting against something then there's something else you're not doing and then I thought also when I was out there on the lake I thought well do I really want to be in a war because War that's not that's not that's not uh that's not heaven that's for sure it's really stressful and people get hurt and so I thought well maybe that's just the wrong way of thinking about it even though there's a Battleground issue here and I thought well wait a second maybe maybe the right thing to do in a situation like this and this is maybe something that those on the alt right might consider is that you the right thing to do maybe is to outline A Better Way rather than go out directly on the attack now that might be seem somewhat at odds with my idea of the website and perhaps it is somewhat at odds with that I'm I'm not sure about that but what I'm trying to do instead of conducting this like a war let's say is to conduct it like a movement towards something better and and that would be better now with regards to cutting the University's funding I thought about that too and I thought wait a second that's not going to work out because it's inviting political interference into higher education now the political interference might be of the counterbalancing because the evidence that the humanities in particular have tilted almost 100% to the left is overwhelming and so maybe some counterbalance from the right would set things more towards the middle but the problem is is when you open up the door to political interference with higher education content you can't close the door again and so on reflection I thought that it probably was a suboptimal idea and that would be better instead was to and what this is what I want to do when I launched the website I want to ask students the students who will be using it's like what do you want from University CU here's here's your options you can you can come out ideologically possessed right you can buy this Doctrine this pathological Doctrine and you can become bitter and resentful and you won't learn to communicate properly and you won't read the great works of civilization and you won't learn to think and write you it won't become Noble in body and spirit is that what you want or do you want the opposite do you want a real education and and then I want to explain what that means like I did tonight to some degree you know that there's absolute value in learning how to put yourself together and to communicate and to familiarize yourself with with with the classic works of civilization and I want to offer that I want to do what I can to offer that as the proper alternative instead of staying ins sconed in this notion of a battle which is just I just don't think it's the right metaphor so I don't either and Dr Peterson I just want to say that I think what you're doing is absolutely miraculous it helps change my life and I'm sure at least raise your hand if Dr Peterson has helped change your life so for the better or for the worse ask him to look at it well it's about it's about 40 people maybe and that's miraculous you know and I think and and your thinking is going to be it's going to be it's going to be all over the place in the Canadian election into years and I think that God that's a horrible thing to contemplate you you to watch out for it buddy and you need and and and there's there's going to be a lot of talk about how um how how uh Andrew Shear's uh political message is going to stem from yours and I think it's really important that he he doesn't censor himself like other conservative politicians are doing and and because I don't know we we we need to unite under a a valid thoughtful articulate conservative voice and what do we have now we have we have Trump that's what's you know we we we don't have any we don't have any strong articulate male voices in our in our um in our political discourse right now that's what it feels it's definitely time for you to develop one so looks like you're on the right path hello hello Dr Peterson uh thank you for everything you've done this past year and I do mean everything the political stuff the this lecture Series going to get you to move just yes great belt it out man okay so uh I'll try to be succinct I have I have two comments and one question okay my first comment is you mentioned how you were prevented from uploading your YouTube video uh from last week yeah um I actually attend that lecture and I make pretty detailed notes so if you want maybe I can email you it's okay I've got it it's my account's reinstalled rein stored rein stored restored yeah and so it's okay it's okay it's it's straightened out and I'm going to upload all the videos to a bunch of other sites and so this isn't going to happen again so but I appreciate that I actually miss some lectures and I do want to look at them online uh my second comment is about um um sort of kind of going into the commentaries of Christian theologist over over the centuries uh like you've done yourself um I just would like to encourage everybody to also look at not just Western Christianity but also Eastern Christianity like the Orthodox writings uh there's a big difference between the two and that that the Western sort of theology comes out of the Roman uh uh Roman law Roman justice so there's a lot more of an emphasis on kind of justice and Christ came he died on the cross for our sin so there's that kind of like legal uh payback you know what I mean right whereas the Eastern the Eastern theology is a lot more um like it it focuses a lot more on love and on sort of the uh the positive aspects and if you do read like the first four centuries of Christianity where there was no Schism uh there's very little mention of like a sort of uh legalistic framework it's a lot more I don't know a pric or more um heartfelt I guess so I think it's important that we also in the west look at the Eastern counterpart um especially more so now because I I do perceive a lot of fake love as being at the center of this malevolence that you mentioned so like you know this whole thing about um demonizing the opposition saying that they're they hard they have no love this and that I perceive that as a lot of fake love um and I think that we have to keep in mind what true love is sometimes it looks ugly like in dealing with psychiatric patients maybe like other countries are not as liberal as Canada but they get results a lot more often you don't say as many psychiatric patients on on the road for example in Greece where I'm from so yeah that was kind of my comment that we need to focus a lot more on what real love is I think and not just the uh the kind of love that you can put on a scale cuz I I don't think that you can put love on a scale so I've been talking as some of you know to this guy Jonathan Paso who's a an orthodox Carver and he started a YouTube channel and he's talking a lot about Orthodox issues and I'm pretty ignorant when it comes to Orthodox Christianity um but from what I understand of it so far there's plenty to be learned so yeah I I'm Orthodox myself uh I just recently came back to my faith two years ago um basically that was the original Christianity then there was a Schism of 1 54 between East and West because of the uh uh the conflicts that these new Christian Christians have with a pope and then after that you also had theism intern within the West between Catholicism and and the Protestants so that's kind of like the big difference that Christianity actually actually came from the East so I think that's why it's important that we look at the most ancient tags because those were the ones that were closest to the original message um so not to my question um it's about atheism um you might hear a lot of times people criticizing uh anybody that has any sort of belief in in a deity or a god um that uh you're just somebody that has an imaginary friend um you know like the the heavenly father that you have to uh adhere to that you have no will of your own so then I there's also like wouldn't the cont argument be that okay so if I have a good relationship with my father and that's why I'm more likely to accept a higher deity than could it be that you as an a IST um maybe you have conflict with your father and that's why you're ad adverse to kind of submitting to a higher being that um that kind of dictates your life well you're you're you're attempting a psychoanalysis of atheism you know and and there's many factors that go into atheism um I would say that you could make that case in some situations but not in all um I do think though and I I think this is perhaps where your question is stemming from is that it's no fluke that at the same time that one of the consequences of the death of God that n announced back in the 1800s is the allout assault on masculinity that's occurring in our culture now and those things are associated and I do think that does have to do with a lack of faith in the masculine spirit and that's a very bad thing because well it's a bad thing for everyone obviously because women have a partially masculine spirit and they have to put up with men and so to demolish that or to fail to nurture it which is certainly what's occurring is just a pathway to Absolute disaster so Y Peterson so this is the type of question that you hate because it's in the category of why why you believe what you believe and uh it's a type of question that uh makes you say I have it right from the last time quote what the hell makes you think it's any of your business so I'm going to try to try to frame it properly okay and I'm asking this at lecture 10 of 12 and after having listened to quite a few hours of you here and elsewhere okay and in so in your second interview with transliminal media you lay out a few things I have some quotes here I'll skip them for brevity you get to the point where you're discussing the embodiment of the logos by Christ as a historical figure and then you say quote is his resurrection real did his body resurrect I don't know in today's lecture you you you alluded to the fact that there are states of Consciousness that perhaps we don't know how to access anymore and let's say that I'm with you there let's say I'm with the idea that there are unknown there are unknown ways to get intimations of the Divine that the embodiment of the logos is associated with physiological Transformations the upper limits of which are unknown and that we might currently classify as paranormal but to dumb it right back down to my level I'm asking about the guy commonly depicted with long hair nailed to a cross until de is a doorknob and all of this goes to the heart of the question of literalism and religious interpretation it goes to the heart of kind of you know what we're doing here at this lecture series are we examining the psychological significance of these stories or are we entertaining the possibility of these Fantastical events I might be struggling with the concept but I I haven't been able to square away and reconcile those statements by you so the question is on the on the question of the resurrection of Christ why is your answer to your own question I don't know instead of at the very least probably not well you're definitely right about me hating that question well I call this series the psychological significance of the biblical stories for a reason you know and the reason was that I'm harshly qualified to talk about such things when I step outside of that then I'm not where I should be I don't think that see I don't think that this is I'm not going to get this right I can't get the words exactly right this isn't about what I believe personally it's partly because I don't know what I believe I don't know what I believe the world's a very strange place I've had some very strange experiences in it I don't think it's helpful for me to to step outside my my jurisdiction and speculate precisely the easiest thing would be to say I think I said what I had to say today I don't think that we know what the up ER limits of human possibility are I don't know what that means metaphysically what I do understand from the gospels is that even the accounts of Christ's Resurrection are complex and difficult to understand I think from Reading yung in large part that you can make a very strong case for the symbolic meaning of the death and Resurrection I think it does stand for the capacity of the human logos to die and resurrect continually as it stries upward I'm not willing to say that that's all it means because I don't know what everything means and I don't know about the fundamental metaphysics of being like I do believe that it's accurate to construe being as a Battleground between good and evil I believe that I believe that is the most accurate way of representing being it's not the most accurate way of representing the objective world that's not the same thing being is that set of experiences which we inhabit and that's only partly objective and it's not obviously reducible to the material not in any straightforward way because we don't understand the material substrate of being at all you know it's it's and when we do attempt to understand it say at the quantum level we run into Mysteries that that baffle the most the most intelligent of us and aware so I'm going to have to leave the question hanging but partly because partly because I don't know what I think but partly because there has to be a line between what I believe and what what I can communicate you know what you believe is Beyond Your Capacity to articulate if you the most at the deepest levels of belief and I can only share with you what I have actually come to understand and there's things that I don't understand and that's definitely one of them I don't know how to draw a line between the symbolic significance of the biblical events say the symbolic and psychological significance of the biblical events and the metaphysics that's underneath them and I think you see the same thing in Yung because when Yung writes technically and formally he never talks about God he always talks about the image of God which is not the same thing the image of God would be your subjective experience of God it says nothing about the objective reality of God because your subjective experience can't say much about objective reality but even in Yung you get this mix you know sometimes it's psychological but then he he makes a metaphysical move and I think that reflected also his the limits of his knowledge because Yong had profound revelatory experiences he was a very strange person you know and I I think so I think what's best for me is to stay on the ground that I'm competent on and to say what I can say about the psychology and to reach beyond that brief briefly when it's necessary but other than that to leave it to hell alone till I understand it better assuming that I ever do so than so uh because of these lectures I've been reading the Bible and well I'm obviously not finished but I'm fairly familiar with uh with how it goes and uh I've been thinking about two parts of it in specific which is the story of Isaac and the the crucifixion of Christ and particularly one of the things that that uh Christ says on the cross which is uh my God my God why have you forsaken me and I've been trying to understand that because that's one hell of a thing for the Son of God to say and you think that would have been edited out yeah no seriously it's like why isn't that gone you know it it it it's it's very inconvenient yeah and in well we hav you haven't touched on the story of Isaac yet but there's this thing the called typ ology which I'm sure you're aware of but basically the idea that what's going on in the Old Testament is sort of the laying out of types for Christ and that Isaac is essentially a type of Christ because they have all these similarities and so I've been thinking about it in that context and thinking about the parallels between them between Isaac and Christ and one of the things that also struck me was mostly the differences between Isaac and Christ and the main difference it seems to me is sort of a difference in direction of sacrifice so the sacrifice is of Abraham is Abraham sacrificing his son to God and then the S the sacrifice of Jesus Is God sacrificing his son to Mankind and I've been trying to understand basically how that works and in relation to the uh you and Western Civilization for 2,000 years yeah well there is these transformations of sacrifice right that can so the next thing that happens in in these stories is that the circumcision circumcision starts to come in as a sacrifice and it seems to be something like the beginnings of replacement for sacrifice of animals it's you know there's this this psychologization of sacrifice so first it's pure external enacted out and then it becomes something that's more conceptual like it becomes embodied in the form of the circumcision and then it becomes more conceptual and that conceptual transformation keeps occurring and and it seems to well it culminates to some degree in this idea of the sacrifice of Christ who's who's God sacrificing his son to mankind but the sacrifice is much more complex than that right it's also Christ sacrificing himself to God and and I think the the the issue there is something like well let's say You're supposed to offer up the best that you have to God that's the sacrifice that's what happens with the high quality animals that that able sacrifices okay but there's something better than the best that you own well what's that well part of it might be well the relationships you have with people are you willing to sacrifice them to pursue the highest good well then are you willing to sacrifice yourself or your son like your son might be that's a tough one I can understand the idea of sacrificing yourself better I'm still wrestling with this story of Isaiah obviously because that's such a complicated story and I do think it's reasonable to think about it as a form of foreshadowing at least the way the Bible is set up of course people who aren't Christian wouldn't agree with that but that that's fine um the idea that you would offer yourself as a sacrifice to God that that seems to me to follow quite logically because well obviously you have nothing greater to give than the best of yourself right so you sacrifice yourself to the highest good and that's part of the man that's part of the way in which humanity is redeemed that makes sense to me that just seems like for me that's that's a pretty straightforward psychological truth the sun issue that's that's a lot tougher thing to wrestle with because one of the things I was thinking with the uh with what Jesus says on the cross is that one of the interpretations of that uh is basically that Jesus in that moment is human basically he not this not not Divine it's just Jesus the human right but that always kind of felt a little bit like avoiding the question to me because you can't just posit something like the Trinity and then say Oh but in this moment that doesn't go right that doesn't count so but if if we think about it in that way of like the difference in the direction of sacrifice and it seems to me that in the sacrifice whoever is making the sacrifice sort of aims toward something so Abraham is sort of reaching for the Divine when he sacrifices when he's going to sacrifice his son and so that would mean maybe God is reaching toward the human and so that would make some sense of that interpretation that Christ is only human in that moment right that that it's the sacrific is accomplished and the reaching down is accomplished but I'm still up to the question what do I make of that because that's one inter well I mean it's useful to have a problem like that because it gives you something to think about right and something to study further and it's it's it's a it's a major it's a major problem I mean the whole issue of well we could say well what's the relationship between the Divine and the human which is obviously brought to the Forefront in the idea of Christ right but it's a personal issue because part of the issue is what's the relationship between you as a finite entity and the Transcendent Infinity that surrounds you well there's some relationship because here you are and the Transcendent Infinity around you exists so there's a relationship the question is what is the relationship and and we don't know that and and and it's dramatized in that story and so I mean partly the the the reason that there's so much conflict and confusion in that story is because it's trying to bring opposing things together right how can something be God and man at the same time it's just like the genie which is the root word of Genius by the way the genie is this incredibly powerful force that can grant wishes right but it's constrained in this tiny little space there's an intimation there that for something to be real it has to straddle The Divide between the finite and the infinite and that's what human beings do I think to some degree and that's dramatized in that story but it doesn't mean that we understand it I mean you know that sometimes you're going to feel that way when you're called upon to make a sacrifice you're going to feel that you've been betrayed by everything and I mean the story is set up that way right Christ is betrayed by tyranny he's betrayed by his best friends he's betrayed by his mortality like that's it's an archetypal story because and he's innocent so the story can't be any worse that's why it's archetypal and I mean the story says to to some degree that under such conditions even God himself would have doubts it's something like that and that's a real that's a powerful idea it's it's a very powerful idea so that's the best I can make out of that for [Applause] now we have to stop so we'll so convene again in a week thank you very much [Applause]"

Who's abel is often the one who's more? Not so much of a revolutionary, but perhaps more of a balance between the revolutionary and the traditionalist something like that Whereas the older son tends to be more traditionalist Authoritarian at least in these metaphorical representations an Adam knew eve his wife and she conceived and bare cain and said I have gotten a man from the Lord, so There's the first human being cain."

That's put forward in The story of Adam and Eve right because we became self conscious and then we discovered the future and then we knew we were going to die and then we knew we were vulnerable and then we Became ashamed and then we developed the knowledge of good and evil, and then we got thrown out of Paradise is like.

    "text": "[Music] thank you so I look today and these lectures have now been watched by they've been viewed a million times so that's pretty amazing freely or they've been they've been glanced at a million times that's right that's also possible all right so well let's get right into it so last week I think was mostly remarkable for the absolute dearth of content that was actually biblically related so that was I'll just recap what I laid out and so that it sets the frame properly for what we're going to discuss tonight and I presented you with an elaborated description of of this diagram essentially which I spent quite a lot of time formulating probably about 25 years ago I guess which kind of accounts for its graphic primitiveness I suppose I was really pushing the limits of my 486 computer to produce that I can tell you so and it's it's it's a it's a description representation of the archetypal circumstances of life and and the archetypical circumstances are the circumstances that are true under all conditions for all time and so you can think about them as descriptively characteristic of the nature of human experience that's not exactly the same as the nature of reality but because you can you can divide reality into its subject of an object of elements and and there's utility in doing that but these sorts of representations don't play that game that they consider human experience as constituted constitutive of reality and that's how we experience it and so we'll just go with that the idea basically is is that we always exist inside a damaged structure and that structure is partly biological and it's it's partly socio-cultural it's partly what's been handed to us by our by our ancestors both practically in terms of infrastructure but also psychologically in terms of the active learned content of our of our psyches and so that would include for example our ability to utilize language and the words that we use and the phrases that we use and the mutual understanding that we develop as a consequence of interacting with each other architect Lee speaking that structures always it's always dead and corrupt and the reason it's dead is because it was made by people who are dead and the reason it's corrupt is because things fall apart of their own accord and the fact that people don't aim properly let's say speeds along that process of degeneration and so what that means and I think this is something worth knowing maybe I'll try standing back here and see if that problem goes away what that means is that young people always have a reason to be upset and cynical about the current state of affairs and and it's that way forever and so it's useful I think to consider such considerations sort of such conceptualizations of the pair of the as the patriarchy in that light because it's an archetypal truth that the social structure is corrupt and incomplete and and what that means is that it's something that you have to contend with every moment in some sense of your life it's a it's a permanent fact of existence and to be upset that the structures of social structures or even the biological structures within which we live are incomplete and imperfect is to and to take that personally that that's the worst part of it to take that person out personally is a misreading of the existential condition of humankind because it's always the case that what you have been given and what you live in is degenerate and corrupt and in need of repair and it's easier just to accept that because there's also a positive development and the pause development as well you've been granted something rather than nothing and maybe you haven't been granted pure hell because especially in a culture like ours where many things actually function quite well so there's room for gratitude there even if it's a broken machine it's not one that's completely devastated and it's not absolutely hell-bent at every second on your misery and destruction and it easily could be because many societies are like that and so the fact that we happen to live in one that isn't corrupt beyond imagining is something to be eternally grateful for well so we live inside a damaged structure and we also bear responsibility for that damage because we don't do everything we can to constantly repair it and you might say well that's actually one of the fundamental you know people say well what's the meaning of life what they really mean is what's the positive meaning of life because as we've already discussed the negative meanings of life are more or less self-evident well the positive meaning of life is to be found in noting the state of lack of repair of the of the walled city that you inhabit and then sallying forth to do something about that to repair the breaches and to fix up the walls and to make the structure that you inhabit as secure and as productive as it possibly can be and there's no shortage of opportunities to do that you can do that in your own mind you can do that in your own room you can do that in your own household in your local community you and maybe if you get good at doing it at all those levels then you can start to look beyond that and so there's challenges that's the thing that's kind of interesting about this insufficient structure is that it has a set of challenges built into it because of its insufficiency and perhaps even because of its corrupt nature that calls forth the potential response from you of heroic adventure and the heroic adventure is to man the barricades and repair the city and you can always do that it doesn't matter what's what your personal circumstances are there's always something that isn't right near you isn't correct isn't laid out properly that you could just fix if you wanted to and one of the things that we're going to talk about tonight is the idea that if you adopt the attitude an attitude that's like that that the rule that you should play is to make things better wherever you are however you can that what would actually happen would be that things would get better wherever you are in all sorts of ways and that we've really as a species you might say or maybe even as singular individuals we we've explored that rarely it isn't something that's put forth as a proposition that often and it's quite surprising to me and you know I had an interesting experience the other day I went to the keg I go there because I have food allergies and they're very careful with people who have food allergies and the waiter took me to the table and he said that he had been watching my lectures and that's a very common experience and he was happy about that and he said that he had two promotions at the keg in the last four months because he'd been watching my lectures and like I really found that an affecting experience because you know you might say well he's working as a waiter at the keg and there's nothing particularly heroic about that and and I disagree with that actually because I don't care where you're located you can do a hell of a job and I mean that literally at whatever job you have you can you can take whatever job you have and you can make it a real nice little piece of absolute misery or you can do you can act like a civilized human being and notice that no matter where you are there's a there's a richness and a complexity that's completely inexhaustible right at hand and then you can take that seriously and you can say well I happen to be a waiter at the keg and perhaps that's not what I expected and he's a young guy and perhaps that isn't where I want to end up but it's not nothing that's a rich environment and I can make it a lot better if I want to I can get along properly with my co-workers and not gossip behind their back and I can treat my customers properly and if an opportunity comes my way I can take it and I can see what happens and so he said that's what he had started doing and that things were working out much better for him he was in a much better job than he was three months ago in three months that's nothing right I mean that's a nice trajectory it's an uphill trajectory and that's what you want really an uphill trajectory is actually even better than being somewhere good as far as I'm concerned because one of the things that really makes your life meaningful is the clear realization that you're headed somewhere better than you are now and then it's even better if you also understand that there's a direct causal relationship between the things that you're doing and the steepness of that incline and so I get a lot of letters from people like that and they're Marse most frequently young men although not always and they say well you know I've been listening to these lectures and I decided that I'm going to try to take responsibility for my life and so I'm I've started to stop doing all the stupid things that I know that that are stupid that I know I shouldn't be doing and I've started doing some of the things that aren't stupid that I know I should be doing which seems pretty obvious really if you think about it but it's obvious though it may be that isn't necessarily what people do and then they write and say you can't believe what difference that makes and they're thrilled about it and so I'm thrilled about it when I get letters like that because I really don't experience anything as better than a letter like that or a message like that because it's so good to see things that aren't so good replaced by something better and I really do think it's an open question I truly believe it's an open question to what degree we could make things better if that's what we actually aimed at doing you know in some of the stories that we've we've come already the story of Cain and Abel in particular is really an analysis of that problem which so remarkable it occurs so so early in this document it's such a such a foundational story and it basically says well there's two modes of being in the world right there's one where you adopt the responsibility for living properly for being properly and you make the sacrifices necessary for doing that and then everything will flourish properly and the other one is a pathway of resentment and bitterness and rejection and murder and genocide and that just seems exactly right to me and so if the positive path beckons if you can actually see what it is if you can if you can lower yourself enough to see what it is young Carl Jung said once that modern people didn't see God because they didn't look low enough so phrase I really really like because people denigrate the opportunities that are right in front of them and there's no reason to do that because what's right in front of you is the majesty of being that's what's right in front of you it's inexhaustibly complex and full of potential and there's no reason to assume that wherever you happen to be isn't as good a starting place as anywhere else now you know I know some people have terrible terrible lives in situations that are absolutely unbearable and but I also do know that even situations like that can be made a hell of a lot worse by the bad by by the worst kind of attitude that's for sure so so anyway so that's where you are you're in a damaged structure you're a damaged structure you're in a damaged structure but you know at least it's got some walls you know you're not being fed to the Lions on a regular basis so that's a good thing and you can you can emerge forward you know heroically magically to confront the chaos that constantly threatens the structure within which you live and you can free something as a consequence of that you can learn something you can strengthen yourself that's the other thing because the way what you're actually made of in many ways that what informs you what you're made of is what you encounter when you voluntarily encounter the unknown and so the more you voluntarily encounter the unknown the more you get may and the more you get made of the more there is to you and then the more you're good at encountering the unknown and restructuring order and and calling forth proper order out of the potential of being and God you got to think why wouldn't you do that since you can do that and it's an endless mystery you know I think part of it is that people well it's also encapsulated to stump some degree in the story of Adam and Eve because what happens to Adam is when he becomes self conscious right he becomes ashamed of himself and regards himself as a lowly sort of creature and there's endless reasons why people would do that because of course we're rife with imperfection and so he hides from God and I think that's actually the answer to the conundrum which is that people don't aspire to the highest good because they're deeply ashamed of themselves and their weaknesses and their insufficiencies and and so it's it's that's not the only reason I mean there's the desire to avoid responsibility and there's all the negative motivations as well like resentment and and and hatred and the desire to make things worse I don't want to you know give us a give us too much of a break but but it's something like that but it's okay then to not be in a very good place if what you're trying to do with that not very good place is make it better and one of the things I really have learned as a clinical psychologist is that you just cannot believe how powerful incremental progress is you could you can do the calculations like it's like compound interest you know if you make your life a tenth of a percent better a week man in two or three years you're in such a better place than you were that it isn't even like the same domain and if you keep that up for ten years or twenty years you know especially if you're young and you start early you start to straighten yourself out and and fix the things that you can fix you can transform your lives in ways that are completely unimaginable and god only knows what the upper limit of that is in terms of human possibility because we are amazing creatures you know when we really get our act together and stop running at 10% of our capacity you know so so so that's what you do you've got you know the fact that things aren't exactly the way they should be at least gives you something to do ooh you know and that's that's and and and maybe something great to do because there's no shortage of suffering in trouble that'd be sets the world that you could conceivably ameliorate in some way and the utility and meaning the utility of that and the intrinsic meaning of that is self-evident so it also makes me curious about nihilism for example and despair because I mean I understand those emotions I understand them deeply and the intellectual mindset that goes along with it but they just seem beside the point to me in some sense because there are so many things that need doing that all you really have to do is open your eyes and look at them and then decide that you're actually going to do something about them and you might think well what's within my scope of influence is so trivial that it's not worth doing it's like it won't stay trivial for long if you do it not at all and I don't think it's trivial to begin with I don't think that any I really don't believe that anything done right is trivial and my experience in my life has been that anything I actually did paid off it didn't pay off necessarily in the way that I expected it to pay off that's a whole different story but if it was genuine commitment to do something even if it went sideways and the outcome was really something other than what I expected the net consequence over time was nothing but good so every new frontier that can be conquered is an advance forward and there's no shortage of frontier because we're surrounded by the unknown we're surrounded by our own ignorance and we can continually move into that domain into the domain of chaos or we can restructure pathological order and that's that's the secret to proper being and so then you encounter chaos that way you know and then you can regard yourself as the sort of entity that despite its insufficiency has the capability to conquer chaos despite the danger of that that's the other thing because the fact that you're fragile is actually a precondition for your heroism because if you weren't fragile then there'd be nothing heroic about doing something difficult right because if you couldn't be hurt or damaged or defeated or or end up in failure then where's the where's the moral courage in the endeavor it has to be that the agility is built into the courage and so it's not it's not a reason not to engage in it at all in fact quite the contrary and so well and so then you know what do you do well you put the city back together and maybe the way you want it so that it's functional and efficient and beautiful and so the people can flourish there and and and flourish in a manner that makes them like it makes them what would you say that makes them feel that the unbearable catastrophe of being is worth it for the experience that's what you're aiming at and it's not an impossibility it's not an impossibility and then not only that not only do you repair the city when you do that but you make yourself the sort of thing that continually repairs the city and that's even better that's the end goal because it's not the repair of the city that's the goal it's the transformation of yourself into the thing that continually repairs the city and so there's just no reason for that not to happen and the more it can happen the better well there's a there's an undercurrent to this story and that is also the story of the flood and that's the fact that you know the city can become corrupt because people don't engage in heroic endeavor or perhaps because they engage in precisely the opposite of that which is outright destructive behavior and this is also something that's worth considering too because if you if you if you consider your your own manner of being you know you can say things to people like tell tell the truth and be good and those aren't those are cliches obviously and so they lack power because they're cliches but you can take them apart and utilize them in a manner that stops being a cliche and you do that by being more humble about them I would say because maybe you can't tell the truth because you don't know what the truth is but one thing you can do is you can stop saying things that you know to be untrue and you might say well how do I know that they're untrue and the answer to that is well you need a whole philosophy of truth the elaboration of an entire philosophy of truth to answer that question and so we're not going to bother answering that question because in some sense at the moment it's beside the point that isn't the issue the issue is there are times in your life where you know that the thing that you're saying is not true it's a deception it's a lie of some sort and you're using it to manipulate yourself or another person or the world and you're also possessed fully possessed of the idea that you can get away with it and there's a satanic arrogance about that in fact that is the archetypal arrogance that's portrayed in the mythological character of Satan because Satan is precisely the archetype of the element of the mind that believes that it can twist and and bend the structure reality without paying the price for that and you can't imagine anything that's more arrogant than not because really do you really think that you can twist the structure of a reality and that that's going to work out for you without it snapping back it's so obvious that that can't work that that everyone knows it but anyways back to the initial point is that you know by the rules of the game that you yourself are playing that some of the times you're violating the rules of the game that you're playing and the first issue with regards to say stating the truth or behaving in a responsible manner would be merely stopped cheating at whatever game it is that you've chosen to play that's a good start and that'll straighten that will straighten out your life it'll start in the straight and start to straighten out your life and so well the flood what the hell does the flood tie into this well you know we live in a corrupt structure we're corrupt as individuals we live in a corrupt structure and part of that corruption has just happenstance it's the way things fall apart but the other part of it is that not only are we not aiming up we're actually aiming down and the flood story is a warning and it's a very clear warning and the warning is if you aim down enough and then if enough of you aim down at the same time everything will degenerate into something that's indistinguishable from the chaos from which things emerged at the beginning of time it's something like that because the the cosmos that's presented in mythological representations is chaos versus order right the order is on top you might say and the chaos is always underneath and the chaos can break through or the order can crumble and you can fall into the chaos and that chaos is intermingle intermingled potential and the way that you destroy the order and let the chaos rise back up which is exactly how its portrayed in the flood story is by well by inhabiting the corpse of your father that's one mythological motif and feeding on the remains and with no gratitude and no attempt to replenish what it is that you're taking from and the warning in the flood story is don't do that for very long because things will happen that are so awful you cannot possibly imagine it and that will happen to you personally and it'll happen to your family and it will happen to your community and it's happened to people over and over throughout history and it's quite interesting you know it's very soon after the story of Cain and Abel when you see evil enter the world in the story of Adam and Eve along with self-consciousness and evil there is the ability that's the knowledge of good and evil that's the ability to hurt other people self-consciously to know what you're doing and then of course instantly Cain takes that to the absolute extreme and he uses that capacity to to destroy really what he loves best he gets as close as a human being can to destroying the divine ideal because of course his brother is able and Abel is favored by God and Cain destroys them which Cain tells God at the end of that episode that his punishment is more than he can bear and I think the reason for that is where are you once you destroy your own ideal what's left for you there's nowhere to go there's no up and when there's no up there's a lot of down and you know there's an idea that was put forth very nicely in Milton's Paradise Lost when he was describing from a psychological perspective essentially what hell is and hell is you're in hell to the degree that you're distant from the good that that might be a good way of thinking about it and if you destroy your own ideal which you do with jealousy and resentment and and the desire to pull down people who you would like to be let's say then you end up in a situation that's indistinguishable from hell and the way the story the biblical story unfolds as well it's it's it's Cain and then it's the flood and so Cain adopts this mode of being that's antithetical to being itself at least a positive being itself he does it voluntarily does it knowing full well what he's doing and the net consequence of this that as it ripples through the entire social structure is that God stands back and says this whole thing is God so bad the only thing we can do is is wipe it to the ground and that is that is no joke that's exactly how things work and one of the things that's extraordinarily terrifying about that sequence of stories and I believe this to be true I think I realized this independently of any of the analysis that I was doing of mythological stories because I looked at what happened in places like the Soviet Union and Mao's China and in Nazi Germany and the most penetrating observers of those societies the people who were most interested in how it was that those absolute catastrophes came about all said the same thing it was rooted in the degeneration of the individuals who made up the society you know you hear what people will thought were following orders it's like no that that explanation doesn't hold water or that you'd be punished if you resisted well there is some truth in that but nowhere near as much as people might think especially at the beginnings of the process more it was that people decided each and every one of them to turn a blind eye to the catastrophes and to participate in the lies and that warped the entire societies and they went as you know they they feared their way downward to something as closely approximating hell as you could hope to manage especially in places like Nazi Germany and well in all three of those places and in Mao is China and in the Soviet Union and so the thing that's so frightening about one of the things that's so frightening about the stories in Genesis is they say something very clear which is that your moral degeneration contributes in no small way to the degeneration of the entire cosmos you say well I would like my life to be meaningful people say that really would you really you really would like your life to be meaningful you think maybe people would made a little nihilism to not have to face that particular realization and I think people do that all the time it's a terrible way to to to realize but we are networked together in that that's the price of or let's say that's the vulnerability that's associated with our intense capacity to communicate and it is certainly possible that the ripples of our individual actions have consequences that are far beyond the limits of our immediate consciousness and I also think people know that too they know that in the way that people know things when they don't want to know them which means they know them embodied they can feel them they can sense them they have an emotional response to them but there's no damn way they're going to let them become articulate because they don't want to know and when you're feeling guilty and ashamed about the things you've done or not done and I know that can get out of hand as well it's often because there is a crooked little part of you that's aiming at the worst possible outcome you know one of the things you said about the shadow you know that young famous idea that everyone has a dark side and that that dark side needs to be incorporated and made conscious young said the shadow of the human being reaches all the way to hell and he actually that's the thing that's so interesting about interesting about reading Carl Jung is he actually means what he says it's not a metaphor it's like the part of you that's twisted against being is aligned with the part of the cosmos let's say the conscious cosmos that's aiming at making everything as terrible as it can possibly be and you know it's a terrible shock to realize that it's partly why people don't realize that it's it's something that people keep at an arm's length it's it's the same as recognizing yourself as a Nazi concentration camp camp guard which is a very useful exercise because there's absolutely no reason why you couldn't have been or still could be one so and if you think otherwise then all the more reason for assuming that you would be unable to resist the temptation if it was in fact offered to you and if you don't think it's a temptation then the then there's so much that you don't know about human beings that you're not even in the game because if it wasn't a temptation then people bloody well wouldn't have done it and plenty of people did it and it's no wonder so so things get serious in Genesis very very rapidly and and the depth of the seriousness is ultimate archetypal that's it gets as serious as it can get the story of Noah and the flood opens in a fragmentary manner and I believe that these passages are part of a longer story that we only have bits and pieces of and an also one that's fragmented in its in its it its parts of more than one story and it starts like this it came to pass when men began to multiply on the face of the earth and and and daughters were born unto them that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair and they took them wives of all which they chose now there's an idea there there's two ways of looking at the past and you can kind of see that in the political landscape that we inhabit now on the more conservative end of the spectrum people regard the past as the land of giants right there were the heroes of the past who established the current conditions that we exist in and then the people on the left are more concerned perhaps with the what would you call it with a lineage of corruption that's come down through the centuries and both of those perspectives are accurate you can say well there were there there were the great heroes of the past who established our modes of being you can think of them as composite beings if you want that's fine that's a perfectly reasonable way of thinking about it and you can also think of the of the accumulation of corruption and evil that's come along the centuries as well and so you see both of those reflected in these initial few lines that the sons of gods so those are the hero's saw the daughters of men that they were fair and they took them wives of all of which they chose then this statement comes in and somewhat of a non sequitur and the Lord said my spirit shall not always strive with man for that he is also flesh yet his days shall be a hundred and twenty years and I looked at a variety of interpretations of that line because it doesn't seem to follow so clearly from the previous line and exactly what it means isn't obvious but it seems to be the first line talks about the heroes of the past and and the second line says wait a second there's something corrupt about the human mode of being and one of the consequences of that as far as God is concerned is that there are conditions under which the divine Spirit will not strive with man what that means is there are conditions under which let's say the I don't think there's any other way of putting it is the divine impulse towards the good will abandon you because of things that you've done and then the secondary consideration here is that perhaps because of the degeneration of people it's not so obvious here that our life spans are limited that the spirit that inhabits us will only do so for a limited amount of time and that's tangled in a strange way in with the idea of human moral culpability and that's posed against the notion of the Giants of the past and then it returns to the giant idea the narrative returns to the giant idea and reads there were giants in the earth in those days and also after that when the sons of men came in unto the daughters of men and they bare children to them and the same became mighty men which were of old men of renown and that's the end of that sequence of fragments it's it's very broken but you can see a dual narrative underneath it and and one of the narratives is that there's the kind of corruption despite the joy the nature of the Giants of the past there's the kind of corruption lurking that would cause God to with hold his grace and allow men to deteriorate and and that sets the stage for Noah and the flood and God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that the and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually you know one of the things I really didn't like about going to church when I was a kid I went to a pretty moderate church it was the United Church which has hardly even become a church now it's so moderate so to speak one of the things I didn't like was the constant harping by the Ministry on the sinful nature of human beings like it didn't speak to me properly partly because I really didn't understand what it meant and partly because it seemed well sort of what would you say was self-flagellating in an unattractive way I don't know if there is an attractive way to be self-flagellating but it was it was and there was something about it there was also wrote and and faked that I didn't like but you know in later years I thought about that more and I started to understand that there was some real utility in asking people to keep the evil that they're doing clear and conscious in the forefront of their imagination I think I mentioned to you guys last week this little episode from what we know of Mesopotamian culture surrounding the emperor the new year's festival they would take the emperor outside of the walled city and strip him of his garb so that he was reduced to just an ordinary man and then humiliate him richly and then ask him how it was over the last year that he wasn't a spectacular embodiment of Marduk and Marduk was the Mesopotamian deity who made order out of chaos essentially and the emperor was supposed to sit and think okay well you know I'm Emperor and everything I should be doing a good job maybe I should even be doing a great job and probably I'm coming up short in a bunch of ways and that actually happens to be important since I'm running the entire show I should be very very cognizant of how I'm failing to live up to the ideal and that is what that call that constant clarion call that's degenerated I would say an institutional Christianity that was actually the idea was look there's a bunch of ways that you're not being everything you could be and it is not supposed to be a whip to knock you down although maybe it's a whip to knock down your pride the pride that stops you from being aware of your insufficiencies it's more like a call to the opposite it's like well you should stop doing those things because you could be so much more than you are and that would be so much better for you and everyone else that it's just it's just not good that you continue doing these things continue breaking your own rules let's say because we could certainly as I said we can start this game by assuming that you should at least play the game that you're playing straight and so and it is the case that if you watch yourself it's a terrifying thing to do but if you watch yourself you'll see you lie a lot like when I learned this to begin with I was in my 20s and I was I'm a smart person and I was very proud of that because I was also a small person I was moved ahead one year in school and I was a small person to begin with and so I was a very small person in my classes and also very mouthy which might not come as much of a surprise and somewhat provocative and so you know and I got pushed around a fair bit because P everybody gets pushed around and my weapon was to be mouthy and it was a fairly effective weapon although it tended to backfire because you know if you're really effectively mouthy with large obnoxious people then they tend to respond in a relatively negative physical way and so that sort of thing was happening to me a fair bit and but I was quite I was quite proud of the fact that I was that I I was I had some intellectual power and that it was then in my 20s when I learned about some of the danger of that because I started to read partly Milton's Paradise Lost and I started to understand the the danger of the intellect and the danger of the intellect as far as I can tell is that it tends towards pride and arrogance and it also tends to fall in love with its own productions and so that's actually Lucifer in Paradise Lost absolu suffer Lucifer is the intellect that falls in love with its own productions and then assumes that there's not outside of what it thinks that's the totalitarian mentality right it's like we have a total system and we know how everything works and we're going to implement it and that'll bring about heaven on earth right that's that's a that that's the totalitarian mindset and that's associated with intellectual arrogance and another at the same time another thing what was happening to me so I was noticing that I started to understand what that meant and I also started to understand that there was more to life than the intellect much more if I smoke too much and I drank too much and I weighed like 130 pounds I wasn't in good physical shape and like I had a lot of things to do when I went to graduate school to put myself together and at the same time I was trying to understand why things had gone so crazily wrong with the world its encapsulation in the Cold War and what role I might be playing in that if any or what role any of us were playing in that at the same time I was working out of prison only a little bit I worked with this crazy psychologist he he is to put jokes on his multiple-choice tests he was a really eccentric guy but I really liked his courses he and he taught a course on creativity and he was also a prison psychologist and he was an eccentric guy and he for some reason like me and maybe because I was eccentric too and he invited me to go out to the Edmonton maximum-security prison with him a couple of times which I did and that was a very interesting experience because I was trying to figure out what role each individual's behavior bore to the pathology of the group was something like that and I went out there and I met a little guy smaller than me I was a little bigger by then and he was a pretty innocuous guy and what had happened was I was out in this gymnasium it looks like a high school the prison which is really quite telling in my estimation but and there were all these like monsters in there weightlifting and like they were monsters I remember one guy who was tattooed everywhere and he had like a huge scar running down the middle of his chest it looked like someone had to hit him with an axe and you know and and I was in there I had this weird cape that I used to wear that I bought in Portugal and some boots that went along with it and yeah I was like an 1890s Sherlock Holmes cape and it was really like it was from the 1890s because this little village was up on a hill it was a walled city on a hill and they sold these things and I don't think they changed the style since 1890 and so I thought they were really cool and so I was wearing that which wasn't perhaps the most conservative garb to dawn if you're going to wear if you're going to go to a maximum-security prison so anyways I was in the gymnasium and the car the psychologist left and god only knows I mean that's what he was like and all these guys came or all these guys came around me you know and they were offering to trade their prison clothes for my tape and was it was like I was being made an offer I couldn't refuse you know and so I didn't I didn't really know what to do and then this little guy said something like that the psychologist sent me to come and take you away or something like that and so I thought well better this little guy banned all these monsters so we went outside the gym through some doors like school doors went outside the gym into the exercise yard I guess and we were wandering along and he was talking to me and he seemed like a kind of an innocuous guy and then the psychologist showed up at the door and motioned us back and so which was kind of a relief and so I went into his office and he said you know that guy that you walked out in the yard with and I said yeah he said he he took two cops one night and he had them kneel down and while they were begging for their lives he shot them both in the back of the head and I thought hmm that's see the thing that was so interesting was that he was so innocuous right because what you'd hope is that someone like that would be very much unlike you let's say and certainly wouldn't be like someone innocuous that you'd met what you'd want is that the guy would be like you know half were wolf and half vampire so you could just tell right away that he was a cold-blooded killer but no he was this sort of ineffectual little guy who was certainly not ineffectual if you gave him a revolver in the upper hand and so so that made me think that made me think a lot about the relationship between being innocuous and and being dangerous and then another thing happened I met another guy out there and then a week or two later I heard that he and a friend of his had held another guy down and pulverized his left leg with a lead pipe like just pulverized it and the reason for that was that they thought that he was a snitch and maybe he was and at that time I did something different instead of being shocked and horrified by that although I certainly was I thought how in the world could you do that because I didn't think I could do that I didn't think that I thought that there was a qualitative distinction between me and those people and so I spent about two weeks trying to see if I could figure out under what conditions I could do that like what kind of psychological transformation I would have to undergo to be able to do that and so that was a meditative exercise let's say and it only took about ten days for me to realize that not only could I do that it would be a hell of a lot easier than I thought it would be and that's sort of where that wall between me and what being described as the shadow started to fall apart and that also was very useful because I started to wreck I started to treat myself as somewhat different entity because I hadn't been aware up to that point you know because I thought I was a good guy and there's no reason for me to think that because you're not a good guy unless you've really made a bloody effort to be a good guy you're just not it's not easy and so you're probably a moderately bad guy and that's a long ways from being an absolutely horrible guy but it's also a long ways from being a good guy and so but I had a little more respect for myself after that because I also understood that there was a monstrous element to the human psyche that that you needed to respect and that was part of you that you should regard yourself in some sense as a loaded weapon it's very useful around children to regard yourself as a loaded weapon because around children you are a loaded weapon and the terrible experiences that many children have with their parents are testament to that anyways about the same time and and I don't exactly know how these things were causally related I guess it was because I was trying to figure out who I was and how that could be fixed something like that I started to pay very careful attention to what I was saying I don't know if that happened voluntarily or involuntarily but I could feel a sort of split developing in my psyche and the split and I've actually had students tell me the same thing that has happened to them after they've listened to some of the material that that I've been describing to all of you but it's split into two let's say and one part was the let's say the old me that was talking a lot and that liked to argue and that liked ideas and there was another part that was watching that part like just with its eyes open and neutrally judging and the part that was neutrally judging was watching the part that was talking and going that isn't your idea you don't really believe that you don't really know what you're talking about that isn't true and I thought that's really interesting so now and that was happening to like 95% of what I was saying and so then I didn't really know what to do I thought okay this is strange so maybe I've fragmented and that's just not a good thing at all I mean it wasn't like I was hearing voices or anything like that I mean it wasn't like that it was it was well people have multiple parts so then I had this weird conundrum is like well which of those two things are me is it the part that's listening and saying no that's rubbish that's a lie that's you're doing that to impress people you're just trying to win the argument you know without me or was the part that was going about my normal verbal business me and I didn't know but I decided I would go with the critic and then what I'd tried to do what I learned to do I think was to stop saying things that made me weak and now that I mean I'm still trying to do that because I'm always feeling when I talk whether or not the words that I'm saying are either making me align or making me come apart and I think the alignment I really do think the alignment is I think alignment is the right way of conceptualizing it because I think if you say things that are as true as you can say them let's say then they come up they come out of the depths inside of you because we don't know where thoughts come from we don't know how far down into your sub structure the thoughts emerge we don't know what processes of physiological alignment are necessary for you to speak from the core of your being we don't understand any of that we don't even conceptualize that but I believe that you can feel that and I learned some of that from reading Carl Rogers by the way who's a great clinician because he talked about mental health in part as a coherence between the spiritual or the or the abstract and the physical that the two things were aligned and and there's a lot of idea of alignment in psychoanalytic and clinical thinking but anyways I decided that I would start practicing not saying things that would make me weak and what happened was that I had to stop saying almost everything that I was saying I would say 95% of it as a hell of a shark to wake up and I mean this was over a few months but the hell of a shark to wake up and realize that you're mostly dead would it's a shock you know and you might think well do you really want all of that to burn off well there's nothing left but a little ha sleight of you it's like well if that 5% is solid then maybe that's exactly what you want to have happened also I told you that story is an elaboration of this line and God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually to question worth asking just exactly what are your motives well you know maybe they're purer than mine were and it's certainly possible I don't think that I'm naturally a particularly good person I think I have to work at it very very hard and I don't necessarily think that everyone is like that but some people are worse than that and everyone's like that to some degree so it's worth thinking about just how much trouble are you trying to cause you know and the other thing you might think about is that if you're not doing something important with your life by your own definition because that's the game that we're playing you get to define the terms at least initially maybe you're prone to cause trouble just because you don't have anything better to do because at least its trouble is more interesting than boring you know that's something you learn if you read Dostoyevsky does he ask you knew that extraordinarily well and so if you're not doing something if you're not pushing yourself to the limits of your capacity then you have plenty of left over what would you say willpower energy and resources to devote to causing interesting trouble and so also I would say this is also an archetypal scenario God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually that's something to meditate on and it's not self-destructive because what it is is an attempt to it's like the diagnosis of an illness it's like if that does happen to be the case for you or to some degree maybe it's only 10% of you or something or maybe it's 90% well then coming to terms of that is excellent because then maybe you can stop doing it and what would be the downside to that you'd have to give up your resentment obviously in your hatred and all of that and that's really annoying because those emotions are very they're easy to engage in and they're and they're engaging and they have this feeling of self-righteousness with them and that goes along with them but you're not doing this in order to put yourself down you're doing this in order to separate the wheat from the chaff and to leave everything that you don't have to be behind and it repented the Lord that he had made man on the earth and it grieved him at his heart and the Lord said I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth both man and beast and the creeping thing and the fowls of the air for it repentance me that I've made them what's the idea well the idea is that the cosmos that God created had become corrupt and that's a funny thing because you know this is the other thing about Genesis that always hits me is that that's also true I told you that the Mesopotamians believe that human beings were made out of the blood of King knew who was the worst monster monster that the dragon of chaos could imagine that's a pretty harsh diagnosis but but the reason the Mesopotamians believe that is because they knew as did the authors of genesis that human beings are the only creatures in the cosmos let's say the cosmos of being who are actually capable of deceit conscious deceit and malevolence and the question is to what degree does the expression of that conscious deceit and malevolence corrupt things so badly that it would be better that they didn't exist at all well you see stories there's a story associated with this in the epic of gilgamesh associated with the flood that has exactly the same underlying narrative structure in fact some people think the story of Noah was derived from it where the gods who created repented of their creation and determined that erasing it would be better than allowing it to propagate and you see the same thing in the Mesopotamian creation myth you knew mulisch because the early gods so they're representatives of the Giants of humanity I would say make so much noise and are so careless that the original creator God timeout and and her consort time app decides to wipe them from the face of the earth and so when you read something like this if you read it from an informed historical perspective it starts to have a depth that makes it transcend this sort of archaic and fairy tale like element of the story it's like I've read some very terrible things about what happened in Nazi Germany and and what happened when the Japanese invaded China and just what happened generally in the history of mankind and things can get so bad that it takes the imagination of a very bad person to conceptualize them and when they get that bad this is the only kind of language that works to describe them you know that's another thing that I've discovered working with my clinical clients is that when their lives are really not going well you know when they're close to suicide or when they're close to homicide or when there are things going on in the family that are so corrupt and terrible that they reach back generations and they're aimed at nothing but misery and destruction the only language that suffices has a religious tone because there's nothing else that's available to describe what's happening with the proper level of seriousness and it might be that you've never encountered a situation that required that level of seriousness but that doesn't mean that those situations don't exist they exist you generally do everything you can to avoid being ensconced in them but they certainly do exist and the probability that you'll encounter a situation like that or two at some point in your life is extraordinarily high you'll tangle with someone who's malevolent right to the core and maybe it'll be you that is and that'll be a big shock and then these sorts of things these sorts of poetic descriptors start to become much more real but Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord these are the generations of Noah Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations and Noah walked with God that's an interesting line because if you remember back in the story of Adam and Eve what happens to Adam once he eats the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and wakes up the scales fall from his eyes become self-conscious develops the knowledge of good and evil is he won't walk with God when God calls him in the garden and so Noah is Adam without the fall essentially and there's something that knows right that motivates God to spare him or maybe to show him a pathway through the emergent chaos something like that and that's worth thinking about a lot because there will be situations in your life where what you face is the emergent chaos and maybe that'll be some terrible catastrophe inside your family or maybe it'll be something that's occurring on a much broader social level but the chaos is coming and what you're going to want to know unless you want to be a denizen of the chaos or even a contributor to it and perhaps that is what you want because many people under those circumstances choose that what you want is to know how you build an ark and get through it that's what you if you're if you're interested in life if you're interested in proper being and you're disinclined to produce any more suffering than necessary then you want to know how to conduct yourself when the catastrophe comes so that you have a reasonable possibility of of moving through it and starting anew so when when this old story says well God's not happy he's going to wipe everything out it's like well you might want to take that seriously and then when it says but there's one person who had a mode of being that protected him from that that's also something you might want to take seriously because you might want to know what that mode of being is because you might need to use it and so these sorts of things are practical in the deepest possible sense they're real in the deepest possible sense and practical in the deepest possible sense so Noah walked with God now I'm going to switch way ahead here because you know they said at the beginning of the lecture series that the Bible is a hyperlinked text and everything refers to everything else and so there's utility in reading it in linear order but it's not a linear document it's a document that that you can move through in an infinite number of there's an infinite number of pathways that you can use to walk through it and all of the document expands upon and refers to all of the rest of the document and so I'm going to switch to the sermon on the mount which i think is probably the key document in the New Testament and I'm going to switch to it because I think it's the closest thing we have to a fully articulated description of what it would mean to walk with God so that you're in the ark when the flood comes it's the it's the most fully articulated realization of that idea that that leaps out of the metaphorical because if I say well you should conduct yourself like Noah and walk with God and build an ark obviously those are poetic and metaphorical suggestions and it's not that easy to bring them into practice right it's the distance there's a big distance between you and the archetype it isn't obvious how to manifest it in your own life and what has to happen is the archetype has to be differentiated and articulated so that it becomes sufficiently practical and personal so that you can actually implement it so I'm going to take apart some of the Sermon on the Mount it starts in Matthew five and I'm not going to talk about Matthew five I'm going to talk about the end of Matthew six and most of Matthew seven consider the lilies of the field how they grow they toil not neither do they spin and yet I say unto you that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these wherefore if God so clothes the grass of the field which today is and tomorrow is cast into the oven shall he not much more clothe you O ye of little faith therefore take no Thought saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or wherewithal shall we be clothed those are famous lines and that's our Christ the hippie right it's like hey let it all hang out that's an old phrase do your thing and everything will come to you and these lines have been interpreted in that manner many times but that's seriously not the proper interpretation because there's a kicker with this injunction and the kicker is this for your heavenly Father knows that you have need of all these things but seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you that's a lot different than the hippie thing right because there's a very very very interesting idea here it's it's certainly one of the most profound ideas that I've ever encountered and the idea is this is that if you configure your life so that what you are genuinely doing is aiming at the highest possible good then the things that you need to to survive and to thrive on a day to day basis will deliver themselves to you that's a hypothesis and it's not some simple hypothesis right because it what it basically says is if you dare to do the most difficult thing that you can conceptualize your life will work out better than it will if you do anything else well how are you going to find out if that's true well it's a Kierkegaard ian's leap of faith there's no way you're going to find out whether or not that's true unless you do it so no one no one can tell you either because just because it works for someone else I mean that's interesting and all that but it's no proof that it'll work for you you have to be all-in in this game and so the idea is seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness it's like that's actually a fairly important caution when you're talking about not having to pay attention to what you're going to eat or what you're going to wear it's like what it's essentially saying is that those problems are trivial in comparison and the probability is that if you manifest yourself properly in the world that those things will come your way is extraordinarily high and I believe I believe that that's exactly right I mean I've watched people operate in the world and I would say that there is no more effective way of operating in the world than to conceptualize the highest good that you can and then strive to attain it there's no more practical pathway to the kind of success that you could have if you actually knew what success was and so that's what this that's what this sermon is attempting to to posit it's like in in the story of Pinocchio you know what happens at the beginning of the story of Pinocchio is that Geppetto wishes on a star we talked about that a little bit and so what you pedo does is align himself with the metaphorical manifestation of the highest good he can conceptualize and say he says he makes he makes a commitment let's say he aims at the star and for him the star is the possibility that he can take his creation a puppet right whose strings are being pulled by unseen forces and have it transformed into something that's economist and real well that's a hell of an ambition you know and we're wise enough to put that in the children's movie but too foolish to understand what it means it's such an interesting juxtaposition that that we can both know that and not know it at the same time you can go to the movie you can watch it and it makes sense but that doesn't mean that you can go home and think well I know what that meant well people are complicated right we exist at different levels and all the levels don't communicate with one another but but the movie is a hypothesis and the hypothesis is there's no better pathway to self-realization and the annulment of being than to posit the highest good that you can conceive of and commit yourself to it and then you might also ask yourself and this is definitely worth asking is do you really have anything better to do and if you don't well why would you do anything else therefore take no thought for the morrow for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof I spend a long time trying to figure out without man to because it's another one of those lines that can easily be read as program offer and anti amped you know you remember the old fable of the grasshopper in the end maybe not I'm not going to tell it but that works in the grasshopper fiddles and the ant has a pretty good time in the winter and the grasshopper dies and so this is like a pro grasshopper line but it's not because it says something else it says that if you orient yourself properly and then pay attention to what you do every day that works and I actually think that that's in accordance with what we have come to understand about human perception because what happens is that the world shifts itself around your aim is you're a creature that has a name you have to have a name in order to do something you're an aiming creature you look at a point and you move towards it it's built right into you and so you have a name well let's say your aim is the highest possible aim well then so that sets up the world around you it organizes all of your perceptions it organizes what you see and you don't see it organizes your emotions and your motivations so you organize yourself around that aim and then what happens is the day manifests itself as a set of challenges and problems and if you solve them properly then you stay on the pathway towards that ape and you can concentrate on the on the ate on the day and so that way you get to have your cake and eat it too because you can you can point into the distance the far distance and you can live in the day and it seems to me that that's that makes every moment of the day super charged with meaning that that's how because if everything that you're doing every day is related to the highest possible aim that you can conceptualize well that's the very definition of the meaning that would sustain you in your life well then the issue is well back to Noah well all hell is about to break loose and chaos is coming it's like when that's happening in your life you might want to be doing something that you regard is truly worthwhile because that's what will keep you afloat when when everything is flooded and you don't want to wait until the flood comes to start doing that because if your arks half built and you don't know how to captain it the probability is very high that that you'll drown take therefore no thought for the morale but for the morale shall take thought for the things of itself sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof that's not a particularly optimistic formulation judge not that ye be not judged for with what judgment you judge you shall be judged and with what measure you mete it shall be measured to you again it's a sensible piece of it's a sensible description I wouldn't call it a piece of advice because I don't think that any of this is advice it's a description of the structure of reality that's not the same as advice and it basically says that you'll be held accountable by the rules of the game that you choose to play and that I also think is perfectly in keeping with what we understand about human psychology because you you are playing you have to play a game that other people will allow you to play and that will cooperate with you while you're playing and it will compete with you while you're playing it but you have a fair bit of flexibility in setting up the parameters of the game but you don't have any choice about whether or not you're going to be in a game you're in a game and you're going to be held accountable by the rules of the game because that's how the game works and so you might want to pick a game by whose rules you would be willing to be held accountable and why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye or how will you say to thy brother let me pull out the mote out of thine eye and behold a beam is in thine own eye well you might be wondering what a beam is and a mote is a dust speck and a beam is a very large piece of lumber and so the issue is not so much the blindness of others even though there's as much blindness among others as there is as there is for you but that issue here the advice here the description here is you should be concerned about what's interfering with your own vision first and you should leave other people the hell alone in relationship to that and so if your mode of being in the world is if you would just act better things would improve for me or if you identify the evil and the catastrophe is something that's outside that someone else needs to fix or that someone's response someone else is responsible for then then you're not going to fix that and you're going to remain blind to the things that you're doing and not doing that make things not go well and so it's just better to think all right I'm probably blind in many many ways and maybe there are some ways that I could rectify that because it's highly probable that you're blind in all sorts of ways I mean it's in fact it's virtually certain and so it's just more useful to think how is it that I'm wrong in this situation I'll tell you something that I learned to do when I was arguing with my wife which happened quite frequently because when you actually communicate with people you find out that there's many things that you don't agree on and that's because you're actually different creatures and so if you're actually going to have a truthful conversation then you're going to find out that you don't see things the same way and then you can either pretend that that's not the case and gloss over it and then end up in a 30 year silent war or you can or you can have the damn fight when you need to have it and see if you could straighten it out so now and then we'd get in a situation where we were at loggerheads we couldn't move and you know it would spiral up into hate speech let's say cuz yeah everyone laughs because they know they manifest plenty of hate speech towards those they loved so one of the things we learned to do was when we hit an impasse was to separate and to go our own ways and to go sit and think okay look we're at this unpleasant situation can't figure out how to move forward I'd always think of course it's her fault obviously it's her fault least 95 percent but maybe there was something I did that contributed like five percent to it and so I would sit and think and ask myself a question which was is there anything I did in the last six months that increased the probability that this impasse would manifest itself and I'll tell you you have no idea how fast your mind will generate an answer to a question like that because there's undoubtedly some idiotic thing that you did that you know that you remember that increase the probability that you're going to have your hands around the throat of the person that you love and then you can go tell them that and then you can have a conversation especially if they do the same thing say look you know here's how I'm an idiot in this situation now the person says well yeah here's how I'm an idiot and then you're two idiots and then maybe you can have a conversation so thou hypocrite first cast out the beam of light out of thine own eye and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote of thy brother's eye that's a hard argue with that ask and it shall be given you seek and ye shall find knock and it shall be opened unto you for every one that asketh receiveth and he that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be opened have some pretty optimistic again but but again I think it's a description of the structure of the existential reality and and but by by which I mean when I'm in my clinical practice and I observe and this is also the case with my students is let's say people's lives aren't what they would like them to be and so then you ask why well forget about tragedy in catastrophe because that's self-evident and we're not going to discuss that although the degree to which you bring about your own tragedy is always indeterminate but I would never say that every terror thing that is visited on a person is something they deserved I think that that's a very dangerous presupposition especially because everyone gets sick and everyone dies but one of the main reasons that people don't get what they want is because they don't actually figure out what it is and the probability that you're going to get what would be good for you let's say which would even be better than what you want right because you know you might be what wrong about what you want easily but maybe you could get what would really be good for you well why don't you well because you don't try you don't think okay here's what I would like if I could have it and I don't mean I don't mean in a way that you manipulate the world to force it to deliver you goods for status or something like that that isn't what I mean I mean something like imagine that you are taking care of yourself like you were someone you actually cared for and then you thought okay I'm caring for this person I would like things to go as well for them as possible what would their life have to be like in order for that to be the case what people don't do that they don't sit down and think all right you know let's let's figure it out you've got a life that's hard obviously it's like three years from now you can have what you need you've got to be careful about it you can't have everything you can have what would be good for you but you have to figure out what it is and then you have to aim at it well my experience with people as being is if they figure out what it is that would be good for them and then they aim at it then they get it and it's strange because they don't necessarily an idea about what would be good for you and then you take ten steps towards that and you find out that your formulation was a bit off and so you have to reformulate your goal you know you're kind of going like this as you move towards the goal but a huge part of the reason that people fail is because they don't ever set up the criteria for success and so since success is a very narrow line and very unlikely the probability that you're going to stumble on it randomly is zero and so there's a proposition here in proposition is if you actually want something you can have it now the question then would be well what do you mean by actually want an answer is that you reorient your life in every possible way to make the probability that that will occur as certain as possible and that's a sacrificial idea right it's like you don't get everything obviously you obviously but maybe you can have what you need and maybe all you have to do to get it is ask but asking isn't a whim or today's wish it's like you have to be deadly serious about it you have to think okay like I'm taking stock of myself and if I was going to live properly in the world and I was going to set myself up such that being would justify itself in my estimation and I don't mean as a harsh judge exactly what is it that I would aim at well one of the things I found is that in in tests of this theory let's say you could try this this is a form of Prayer knocking sit on your bed one day and ask yourself ah what's what remarkably stupid things am i doing on a regular basis to absolutely screw up my life and if you actually asked that question but you have to want to know the answer right because that's actually what asking the question means it doesn't mean just mouthing the words it means you have to decide that you want to know you'll figure that's out so fast it'll make your hair curl you'll you it's as if you thought about this he thought you know he thought that people had two poles of consciousness and one was the individual consciousness that we each identify with in the other was something he called the self and the self is the you might think about it as the divine within that's close enough approximation and to the universal part of your consciousness it's your conscience that's another way of thinking about it whatever your conscience is but it's something that you can consult it's like the Socratic Damon Socrates said that the thing that made him different than every in Greece was that he consulted his Damon his genius he asked himself how it was that he should conduct himself in the world and then he did that whatever it was he didn't try to force a solution you know he didn't try to force a solution selfishly he asked I'm going to manifest myself in the best possible manner in the world I would like to do that what would that be well you're perfectly capable of thinking god only knows how you're perfectly capable of men speeds of imagination and and dream and fantasies god only knows how you do all of that what would happen if you consulted yourself about the best possible outcome for you you might get an answer well that's what this proposition is or what man is there of you whom if his son asks for bread we'll give him a stone or if he asks for a fish will give him a serpent if ye then being evil know how to give good gifts unto your children how much more shall your father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him well this is a question about the fundamental nature of being I suppose and one of the hypotheses in the New Testament which is different to different hypotheses in some sense than the one that structures the Old Testament is that faith makes being good it's a very interesting proposition and so the notion would be and it's an action-oriented issue as well you act out the proposition that if you act properly in the world that being will reveal itself to you as benevolent but you will not know you'll never know unless you do it so this is a call to that act out the proposition that if you act properly that being itself is benevolent no reason to assume the contrary I mean to assume the contrary would be to be as cynical and bitter as possible and it's not like we don't have reason for that it's not like I don't understand why that happens to people therefore all things whatsoever you would that men should do to you do you even so to them for this is the law and the prophets and that's a reciprocity issue right it's like well imagine what would be this is another thing I learned from Jung because as Jung reversed this because this is often read it's it's the golden rule it's often read as be nice to it be nice to other people it's like that is not what this rule means it doesn't mean that even a little bit it means something like and we'll reverse it so that will concentrate on you rather than the other person to begin with it means something like conceptualize how things could be great if they were great for you if you were taking care of yourself and then work to make that the case for everyone else you know you see that in Buddhism because Buddha reached Nirvana right that's the theory and then he was tempted with the offer to stay there and he rejected that offer and came back to the profane world because he felt that the attainment of Nirvana was insufficient unless everyone attained it simultaneously and so it's something like that but it's treat yourself properly that's a hard thing to do because you're a fallen shameful cowardly deceitful malevolent mortal creature and so it's not easy and you know it and it's not easy to treat something like that properly and and it isn't obvious that people treat themselves better than they treat other people I don't think that's obvious at all but maybe you could start with yourself and think okay I'm going to take care of myself as if I have value what would that look like and then I'm going to work to extend that courtesy to everyone else and that's well the hypothesis here is that if you take all of the moral wisdom that mankind has generated over its millennia of struggle evolved and then manifested metaphors story and then codified into law articulated law and you pick one principle that dominated all of that this would be the principle and it's interesting too because it's the law and the prophets and the law is the rules but the prophets are the process by which the rules are being updated right and so the prophets are superordinate in some sense to the law and the proposition that's set forth in this particular statement is that this maxim which is optimize your own mode of being and then work to do the same for everyone around you is not only the thing that's at the core of the law but it's at the core of the process that generates and updates the law to hell of a thing for someone to say enter ye in at the narrow gate because that's what Strait means enter ye and at the straight gate for wide is the gate and broad is the way that leadeth to destruction well who in the world could possibly argue with that everyone in the right mind knows that there's a million ways of doing things wrong and one way if you're lucky to do things right and so the notion that it's a very very narrow pathway that you tread upon if you're doing things right that's that's wisdom that's the line between chaos and order that you're supposed to be on constantly right it's a very very thin line because if you're a little bit too far in one direction then it's too much chaos and if you're a little too far in the other direction then it's too much order and both of those aren't good it has did the balance have to be exactly right and you can feel that and I truly believe you can feel that and I think it's your deepest instinct it's your deepest instinct and I mean that I mean that biologically I don't mean that metaphorically I think that your psyche is arranged to exist in a cosmos that's composed of chaos and order I think that's why you have the hemispheric structure that you have this is deeper than metaphor and then when you feel as if you're meaningfully engaged in the world when the terror of your mortality strips away and you're engaged and it's timeless that's the deepest instinct you have telling you that you're in the right place at the right time and then what you do is practice being there practice being there and that's that that narrow spot is so difficult to find you wander around it maybe if you're lucky you can watch you can watch this as an experiment watch yourself for two weeks like you don't know who you are because you don't so watch yourself for two weeks and notice there's going to be times when things are proper their raid properly for you yeah it's not easy to notice because when they're arrayed like that you're so engaged you don't exactly notice you know but you'll see oh I'm in the right place it's like okay how did I get here what am i doing right you know how is it that this could happen more often I'd like this to happen more often how would I have to conduct myself in order for that to happen more often and then you practice that and then maybe instead of ten minutes a month or ten minutes a week it's like 15 minutes a day and then it's half an hour a day and then it's an hour a day and then it's four hours a day and maybe if you if you're extraordinarily careful then you get to a point where you're like that a good proportion of the time because Strait is the gate and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life and few there be that find it beware of false prophets which come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly they are ravening wolves that's particularly good advice for today's political situation I can tell you you shall know them by their fruits do men gather grapes of thorns or figs of thistles even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit well that's what I learned from studying the history of totalitarianism in the 20th century is that a corrupt tree brings forth evil fruit and that's for sure and so funny you know people who think when they're thinking about the relationship with divinity or the relationship with God they think it's a primitive and childish way of thinking what if a miracle just manifests why can't a miracle just manifest itself and I would be convinced and the funny thing is is first of all actually you wouldn't be if a miracle actually happened you would actually forget about about six months that's I mean you'd think that's not true but it's true you would actually forget about it because that's what people are like but there are negative miracles that are happening all the time which actually lend some credence to my supposition and we don't pay any attention to that if we can't learn from what happened in the 20th century then we are absolutely incapable of learning because what happened in the 20th century was as bitter a set of lessons as you could possibly imagine and its associated precisely with this a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit every tree that bringeth forth that bringeth not forth good few fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire well that's a flood motif right there it's like we're constantly the archetype of the tree that's the archetype of being it's the archetype of the self often what's the warning here that if you're mostly deadwood you're going to get you're going to burn up and you can think about that metaphysically you can you can project that into eternity and you can think about that as a form of Hell and the funny thing is is that when that's happening to you in real time it is like an eternity in hell it's a perfectly reasonable way of thinking about it but you can strip the metaphysical elements off and you can say well if you're mostly dead wood then a spark will light you on fire and that's also very much worth thinking about wherefore by their fruits shall you know them not everyone that saith unto me Lord shall enter the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven that's an interesting line I think I mean one of the proper critiques of traditional Christianity maybe this is the sort of critique that Nietzsche put forth was that Christianity had degenerated in its moral mission Jung was a little bit more sympathetic and I'll tell you why in a minute but Nietzsche's idea was that Christianity had lost its way when it generated the presupposition that human nnedi was saved in some final sense by the sacrifice of Christ it meant that the work was already done and that and I'm I'm being I'm being harsh in my judgment for the purpose of rhetorical simplification but the idea was that if you just professed faith that that had already occurred then you were granted eternal salvation it's like well it's not so straightforward and I think that that's what this line actually represents it says how you enter into the kingdom of heaven and and again you can think about that under the aspect of eternity or you can think about it as a psychological statement and the answer is quite straightforward is that you do what Noah did to make him immune from the flood and that's to walk with God and that's what this sermon is about it's laying out the practical elements of that and the practical elements are aimed at the highest possible good and play that out in the world and then you may have the opportunity to inhabit the highest possible good that you're positing into existence perhaps not but you can't think of any more practical way of going about that I mean if you build a house then maybe you can live in it if you don't build a house you're not going to be able to live in it if you build a good house then you'll be able to live in a good house and if you build a perfect house then maybe you can live in a perfect house but if you just say that the house has already been built for you and that you can just say that the house is being built for you well then the probability that you're going to be able to live where you need to live is there's no probability that you're going to be able to live where you need to live many will say to me in that day that's the Judgment Day Lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name of cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works and then I will profess unto them I never knew you depart from me you that work iniquity see that's Judgment Day you know that's an archetypal idea and partly it's archetypal because everyday is Judgment Day and the part of you that the part of you that's equivalent to the logo say the part of you that's your own ideal sits in eternal judgment on your iniquity and that's the con that's the source of guilt and shame and and and withdrawal and then resentment and then murderous 'no sand then genocide it's because you can intuit the ideal and the problem with intuiting the ideal is that an ideal is always a judge there's no difference between an ideal and the judge and so you're eternally judged by your own ideal if you have no idea well then you've got no direction and no meaning in your life and then of course the more extremely ideal the harsher the judge that's actually why young young was very curious about why the book of Revelation was tacked on to the Bible to the book of Revelation that's a very weird book and you know in in in the Gospels Christ is I would say perhaps primarily merciful there's a maybe a war in his character between truth and mercy but it's one of the two perhaps mercy and Jung's observation was the gospel Christ was too merciful and that's why the book of Revelation was tapped on tacked onto the New Testament because in the book of Revelation Christ who's the ideal who's above the pyramid right the transcendent ideal is nothing but a judge and everyone fails and of course the ultimate ideal is the ultimate judge and so that's the archetypal reality there and you can say well I don't want to be judged and so I'll dispense with the ideal but then you're Cain because Cain is exactly the person who dispenses with the ideal and so there's no escaping from it there's no escaping from eternal judgment that's the archetypal story you know people put a lot of work into these representations you know and there's thousands of them they weren't messing around these are serious pieces of work you know we don't understand them but that doesn't mean that the people who created them didn't know what they were doing these were geniuses who created these pieces of work it's not like they understood in an articulated manner what they were trying to represent but what they were representing were the the metaphor is at the core of our culture to the degree that our culture is functional and good these are the metaphors upon which it's founded and they're not for the faint of heart you know you say religion is the opiate of the masses it's like yeah then how do you explain this exactly you know because if it was opiates you're after you might just get rid of that panel especially when the other thing that's so interesting about the proposition if you look at revelations in Revelation and you look at the judgment almost everyone ends up on the right side of this panel so if you are just conjuring up some sort of pathetic wish fulfillment why in the world would you tilt the scales in that manner you think that's supposed to make people feel good I don't think so there's almost nothing about this picture that should make people feel good it should if you understand it properly it should terrify you to the depths of your soul that's what the picture is for therefore whoever heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them I will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock and the rain descended and the winds blew and the floods came and beat upon the house and it fell not for it was founded upon a rock and every one that heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them not shall be likened unto a foolish man which built his house upon the sand and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew had beat upon that house and it oh I made a mistake and it fell for it was founded upon the sand and it came to pass this is a very interesting line I really I really you know now and then you run across lines in this particularly happens in biblical settings you run across lines that you cannot believe actually exist you cannot imagine how someone could have imagined up and conjured up the line and these two lines are like that as far as I'm concerned and it came to pass when Jesus had ended these sayings that people were astonished at his doctrine for he taught them as one having a authority and not as the scribes and that's something so interesting you know because that was another thing that really I didn't really appreciate about the churches that I attended to and that would be that the lessons were taught by scribes and the words were mouthed but there was no power in them there was no meaning in them it was it was as if well it was like when I was 20 years old and I was saying all these things I didn't mean you know they were words that sounded good they were like like gilded cloth I suppose that you can that you can wrap around yourself but there's no substance to them and there's a big difference between listening to something that has substance and listening to something that is spoken because it sounds like it should sound good and this line says that whoever spoke the lines that we just described was someone who sounded like he knew what he was talking about and not someone who was just repeating something for the sake of sounding good and it certainly seems to me that the lines that we just reviewed have the awesome impact of authority back to Noah but Noah found grace in the eyes of the Lord these are the generations of Noah Noah was a just man and perfect in his generations and Noah walked with God and Noah begat three sons Shem ham and Japheth the earth was also corrupt before God and the earth was full of violence filled with violence any of you see the new NRA ad you might want to look that up I would say that's the most shocking manifestation of political polarization in the United States that I've yet seen most of it I've seen on the left/right the real what shocked me mostly has been on the left but the new NRA ad that's a whole new thing so it's this attractive woman and doing a voiceover she kind of looks like Demi Moore well she's kind of tough looking I guess Demi Moore could look tough now and then and she has contempt on her face and that's a dangerous thing and in the background there's nothing but images of anteye far is and Berkeley riots and fire and protest and she's describing that as a conspiracy essentially a conspiracy that involves the intellectual elite including Hollywood which is named by name the accusation is is that there's a cabal of corrupt intellectuals let's say who are bringing the country to its knees and that it's time to get your goddamn guns and so look up that and see what you think because there's lots of people who would be perfectly happy if that was the direction in which you were headed and one of the things that I'm hoping is that we might be able to talk our way through it but we're in a situation where every act of idiot individual idiocy will push us one iota closer to the brink and that'll make the 15 percent of the population or 30 percent of the population who would love to see everything degenerate into chaos perfectly happy because that's their aim the earth also was corrupt before God and the earth was filled with violence and God looked upon the earth and behold it was corrupt for all flesh is corrupted his way upon the earth and Noah said and God said unto Noah the end of all flesh has come before me for the earth is filled with violence through them and behold I will destroy them with the earth make the an ark of gopher wood rooms shalt thou make in the Ark from that shalt pitch it within and without with pitch and this is the fashion which thou shalt make of it the length of the ark shall be 300 cubits the breadth of it 50 cubits in the height of it 30 cubits a window shalt thou make to the ark and in a cubit shalt thou finish it above and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the side thereof with lower second and third stories shalt thou make it and behold I even I do bring a flood of waters upon the earth to destroy all flesh wherein is the breath of life from under heaven and everything that is in the earth shall die but with thee I will establish my covenant and thou shalt come into the are thou and thy sons and thy wife and thy sons wives with thee that's a fairly optimistic twist on the story because not only is it Noah but he gets to save his whole family and down a couple of generations and so that's a good thing to think about it's like as things know I had this client and she had a very hard upbringing I would say not a lot of encouragement to say the least let's say a fair bit of discouraged meant and she had a son and what was really interesting about her in relationship to her son is that all the things that she could have learned to do to him given her extensive experience with being made as miserable as possible by someone who was hell-bent on bringing her to her knees she refused to do to her son right she learned the opposite lesson from all her misery and torment which was not to move that forward down the generations and so the idea here is that if you walk properly a name properly and act properly if you walk with God in this manner that we've been discussing is that perhaps that isn't only good for you perhaps it's also the thing that will save your family and then by implication perhaps saves Society because that's exactly what happens with Noah right first it's him and then it's his family but everything else goes and so by saving himself by acting properly and by saving his family he actually saves the world it's interesting you know it's like the most profound people that I've read who've meditated deeply on the problem say of totalitarian catastrophe and I would put Alexander Solzhenitsyn at the top of that list you know the his entire corpus three volumes 700 pages long each in tiny type is a long scream about the absolute necessity of individual the absolute necessity of individual honesty and ethical behavior as the only bulwark against totalitarian catastrophe and that and I've read many writers who've attempted to diagnose the problems of the 20th century and I think elgyn Edson he came to the same conclusions that Viktor Frankl came to as a consequence of his experiences in the Nazi concentration camps and Frankel I am also an admirer of Franco but Solzhenitsyn takes it to an entire different level of profundity and makes an extraordinarily strong case that not only do societies deteriorate because the people within the societies become individually corrupt but that the only way to stave that off is for the individuals within that society to reject that corruption in the in the confines of their own personal lives and he tells endless stories of people that he met in the gulag and in the work camps in the death camps in the Soviet Union of people and this is what he learned of people who were so incredibly tough that even under conditions the most possible extreme conditions there wasn't a chance that they were going to step off that straight and narrow line there was nothing the authorities could do to move them and just watching that was enough to transform Solzhenitsyn because of course one of the things he wondered was after spending a good amount of time in the work camps was well just exactly how did I get here and it wasn't well it was Hitler's fault and it was Stalin's fault although it was definitely the fault of both of them for Solzhenitsyn it was well it was also his fault because he was playing the same game he just wasn't as good at it and of every living thing of all flesh two of every sort shall thou bring into the ark to keep them alive with thee they shall be male and female and so there's another message in this story which is that it isn't only Noah and his family and human society that's dependent on Noah's appropriate actions in the world it's the entire living planet and in an era of excessive and extreme and genuinely disingenuous environmental catastrophe Singh that's something to consider very seriously think perhaps there's nothing better that you can do for everything all things considered including those things that are outside the confines of human society than to get your act together and align yourself properly along all of the dimensions of your being from from from the tiniest microcosm to the to the ultimate macrocosm and that's the way that all of being is redeemed that's what the story suggests and we read it you know a cynical modern people we read it as if it was written by primitive people who thought that it was really the case that someone could build a boat and put two of every kind into it and thereby saved the world it's embarrassing to see things interpreted in a manner that shallow especially by people who don't have ignorant as a justification you know these stories have to appeal to everyone right and there's lots of people in the world who aren't very bright and so they tend to take things concretely like a child would take things concretely if you read them a story and this story can be taken concretely but it has to be because these stories have to be for everyone but if you're sophisticated that doesn't mean that you should dismiss it as if it's written for a child it's maybe you have the obligation to look a bit deeper and think for a moment that it wouldn't been conserved for these many thousands of years if there wasn't something more to it than a casual intellectual dismissal would indicate and take thou on to the of all food that is eaten and thou shalt gather it to thee and shall be food for the end for them thus did Noah according to all that God commanded him so did he and the Lord said unto Noah come thou and all thy house into the ark for the I have seen righteous before me in this generation of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens the male and his female and a beasts that are clean but not clean by two the male and his female of follows also of the air by sevens the male and the female to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth for yet seven days I will cause it to rain upon the earth forty days and forty nights and every living substance that I've made will I destroy from off the face of the earth and Noah did according unto all depth lord commanded him and though it was 600 years old when the flood of waters was upon the earth and Noah went in and his sons and his wife and his sons wives with him into the ark because of the waters of the flood of clean beasts and the beasts that are not clean enough follows and of everything that creepeth upon the earth they went in 2 and 2 unto Noah into the ark the male and the female as God had commanded Noah and it came to pass after seven days that the waters of the flood were upon the earth in the six hundredth year of Noah's life in the second month the seventeenth day of the month the same day were all the Fountains of the great deep broken up and the windows of heaven were opened and the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights and the self-same day entered Noah and Shem and ham and Japheth sons of Noah and Noah's wife and 3 wives of his sons with them into the ark today and every beast after his kind and all of the cattle after their kind and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth after his kind and every fowl after his kind every bird of every sort and they went into Noah unto Noah into the ark two and two of all flesh wherein is the breath of life that makes know where they ultimate Shepherd right Shepherd of all things tender of the garden and Shepherd of all things that's a hell of a roll and maybe that's the one that keeps you afloat during the flood and they that went in went in male and female of all flesh as God had commanded him and the Lord showed him in and the flood was forty days upon the earth and the waters increased and bear up the ark and it was left up above the earth and the waters prevailed and were increased greatly upon the earth 15 cubits upward did the waters prevail and the mountains were covered and all flesh died that moved upon the earth both of fallen of cattle and the beasts and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth and every man and all in whose nostrils was the breath of life of all that was in the dry land died and every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the earth both man and cattle and the creeping things in the fall of the heaven and they were destroyed from the earth and Noah only remained alive and they that were with him in the ark and the waters prevailed upon the earth one hundred and fifty days and God remembered Noah every living thing and all the cattle that was with him in the ark and God made a wind to pass over the earth and the waters receded the Fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were stopped in the rain from heaven was restrained and the waters returned from off the earth continually and after the end of a hundred and fifty days the waters were abated and the ark rested in the seventh month on the seventeenth day of the month upon the mountains of Ararat and the waters decreased continually until the tenth month in the tenth month on the first day of the month were the tops of the mountains seen and it came to pass at the end of 40 days that Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made and he sent forth a raven which went to and fro until the waters were dried up from off the earth and he also sent forth a dove from him to see if the water's were abated from off the face of the ground but the devil found no rest for the sole of her foot and she returned unto him in the ark for the waters were on the face of the whole earth then he put forth his hand and took her and pulled her in unto him into the ark and he stayed yet another seven days and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark and the Dove came in to him in the evening and lo in her mouth was an olive leaf plucked off so Noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth and he stayed there yet another seven days and sent forth the Dove which returned not again unto him anymore and it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year in the first month the first day of the month the waters were dried up from off the earth and Noah removed the covering of the ark had looked up and behold the face of the ground was dry and in the second month on the seventh and twentieth day of the month was the earth dried and God spake unto Noah saying go forth of the ark thou and thy wife and thy sons and thy sons wives with thee bring forth with the every living thing that is with thee of all flesh both of fowl and of cattle and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth that they may breed abundantly in the earth and be fruitful and multiply upon the earth and Noah went forth and his sons and his wife and his sons wives with them beast creeping thing every fowl and whatsoever creepeth upon the earth after their kinds went forth out of the ark and Noah builded an altar unto the Lord and took of every clean beast and of every clean fowl and offered burnt offerings on the altar immediate returns the sacrificial motif and the Lord smelled a sweet savour and that's Noah's proper sacrifice and the Lord said into his heart I will not again curse the ground any more for man's sake for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his youth neither will I again smite any more every living thing as I have done while the earth remaineth seedtime and harvest and cold and heat and summer and winter and day and night shall not cease and God blessed Noah and his sons and said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replenish the earth and the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth and upon every fowl of the air upon all that moveth upon the earth upon all the fishes of the sea into your hand are they delivered you know I've heard commentators David Suzuki for example who claimed that the substructure of Western culture in lines such as this deliver the earth over to human beings and and justify our ravaging of the of being but I don't think that that's a very careful reading and it seems to me that given such matters given the importance of such matters that a very close reading is actually necessary you know in the story of Adam and Eve when Adam and Eve are thrown out of the garden God tells Eve that she's going to be subordinated to her husband he doesn't say that that's what should happened he says that's what's going to happen and the same thing as far as I'm concerned is contained in lines like this isn't necessarily that this is something that should happen it's something that did to happen it's quite remarkable you know to think about how long ago these lines were penned it wasn't obvious until perhaps the 1960s that we had dominated the earth so completely that it's very future existence within our hands and that's a prophetic element of this tale and the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every beast of the earth and upon every fowl of the air and upon all that moveth upon the earth and upon all the fishes of the sea into your hand are they delivered like that's exactly right every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you even as the green herb I've given you all things have I given you all things but flesh with the life thereof which is the blood thereof shall you not eat and surely your blood of your lives will I require at the hand of every beast will I require it at the hand of man at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of man this is a hard section to interpret but what it means is something like this God describes the dominion over the planet that vilified humanity will have and note the power that goes along with that and then puts a limitation on it and the limitation is maintain the sanctity of life despite your power and although it's not easy to extract from the manner in which this is being translated what God is telling Noah is that if you kill yourself if you kill someone else and if any animal kills a human being that there will be a price to pay for that so there's a an opportunity which is that the descendants of Noah can dominate the earth but there's a moral limitation placed on that which is nonetheless life itself is to be regarded as sanctified and sacred whoever shared if man's blood by man shall his blood be shed for in the image of God made he mad and you be you fruitful and multiply bring forth abundantly in the earth and multiply therein and God spake unto Noah and to his sons with him saying and I behold I establish my covenant with you and with your seed after you and with every living creature that is with you of the fowl and the cattle and of every beast of Earth that is with you for all that go out of the ark to every beast of the earth and I will establish my covenant with you neither shall all flesh be cut off anymore by the waters of a flood neither shall there be anymore a flood to destroy the earth and God said this is the token of the Covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you for perpetual generations I do set my bow in the cloud and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the earth and shall come to pass when I bring a cloud over the earth that the bow shall be seen in the cloud and I will remember my covenant which is between me and you and every living creature of all flesh and the waters shall no more become a flood to destroy all flesh there's a negotiated agreement there of sorts and the negotiated agreement is as far as I can tell to the degree that humanity agrees to act in the manner of Noah then the threat of catastrophic destruction will remain at bay and the bow shall be in the cloud and I will look upon it that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth and God said unto Noah this is the token of the Covenant which I've established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth this is the token of the Covenant which I've established between me and all flesh that is upon the earth so that's a good place to stop and there's no lecture next week by the way because the theater was booked so there'll be a one-week break and then when we get back we'll finish the story of Noah there's not much left of it we'll talk about the Tower of Babel which is a very short story but a very very interesting one and then we'll move on to the story of Abraham and so thank you very much for coming and we'll see you in two weeks [Applause] now is the person who has the notification for the meetup after this here and do they have the notification okay because if you give that to me this time I'll remember to read it before everyone leaves so do you want to start okay so see it let's see if the mic is working because lots of people will listen to this question and so okay okay so you said on a recent livestream that you were to you didn't have enough energy to answer this question but you said it was intriguing so I was wondering if you had the energy to answer how someone might help someone that has borderline personality disorder by example by example no no no I don't I don't mean that precisely I mean that the let's not take borderline personality disorder precisely as the example okay I understand the question the question to some degree is how do you help someone that's lost and answer that is if they aren't willing to not be lost you cannot help them and I would also say that as a clinician you see I mean it's an it's a statement that's informed I would say by mythological knowledge but also by straight clinical wisdom not mine particularly I mean one of the things that Carl Rogers pointed out was that there were necessary preconditions for entering into a therapeutic relationship and that would be really any relationship where the mutual flourishing of the two people involved was the Paramount goal and one of the preconditions was that both people had to want that to happen and Rogers believed he didn't know how to get the horse to drink when she had brought it to the water and I thought about that a lot because when people are really lost sometimes they're so lost that that they can't be found and I think the only thing that you can do in a situation like that is get your life together and she and manifest the reality of an alternative mode of being that's what you've got and so that's the only way I know of to solve an intractable problem and I would say the reason that I went down that direction with regards to borderline personality disorders because it's one of the most serious of the personality sort is very difficult to treat and so I'll generalize from that to situations that are very difficult to deal with and you know there's a statement to and this has nothing to do with borderline personality disorder per se there's a statement in the New Testament that's really vicious in fact there's a number of them but this is a particularly vicious one and that is don't cast pearls before swine and what that means is if you're trying to help and it doesn't work then stop helping it's not helping right it may be just wasting your time it might be making things worse no if you're if you're offering something and it's not taken then perhaps you should be offering it somewhere else and sometimes if you offer hand and the person won't take it you have to stop offering the hand and then what you do is you go off and you have your life and sometimes that means in people's lives for example that they have to leave their family members behind there's a scene in the New Testament this is another very harsh scene where Christ is walking down the road with his disciples I hope I've got this story right but I've got it essentially right and his mother calls to him and says I believe that he's supposed to come back to the home because his uncle has died and that there's going to be a funeral and he turns to his mother and says something like let the dead bury their dead I'm about my father's business it's something like that and you read that you think huh that should have been edited out no but it shouldn't have been added it out because it's exactly right because sometimes the thing you do is walk away because there's no other solution and if you are trapped in pathologic relationships and you see no way out of them if you if someone who is thinking has their hands around your neck and is pulling you down you're not obligated to drown with them now there's a rule too if you're a lifeguard you know some of you have had lifeguard training how do you approach someone who's drowning and panicking in the water feed out right like this it's like I'll save you but that doesn't mean you get to drown me while I'm doing it and if it's you drown or both of us drown it's you drown and that's wisdom that's not cruelty right so yeah a couple of questions about dialog and engaging in dialogue with people so the first issue that I face is I have a very high need for intellectual stimulation and I can't get that with most people it's something like you can you can have a dialogue for a time but then titrate openness yeah and then I would then they started run out of ideas they can keep up and it sort of falls apart okay this is the problem that intellectuals have quite frequently is that they sort of once they start reading difficult and rewarding stuff yeah they stopped wanting to talk to regular people and I think that contributes to the disconnect that you see between intellectuals and working-class people and stuff like that and the other question I had was about okay wait I don't know if that's a question I mean I believe there's a question in there but I digress tchen is how did we dress that how should I dress it and is that something that can be dressed well part of part of the answer to that is that's what the universities were for I mean you know not everybody is equipped to or interested in engaging in high-level discussion of abstract and creative ideas you know you hear this idea that everyone's creative that's a lie it's as straightforward as that drew creativity is very very rare and so and if you happen to be a creative person or if you happen to be someone who's profoundly interested in ideas you are in a pronounced minority just as you are if you happen to be extremely extroverted or extremely agreeable or extremely conscientious these are minority issues and what you do is you find like-minded people who are capable of engaging that you know a heavy weight with heavy weight weight lifters compete with heavy weight weight lifters for a reason and everyone thinks that's fine the same thing applies to intellectual and creative endeavors so what you do is you try to find a community where that's that's the nature of the community and you likely have to find a relationship like that as well you know so I don't think so I think what contributes to the siloing is the arrogance that goes along with it because if you're you can be interested in ideas and you can be creative well that's the arrogance of the intellect right that's the thing the Catholic Church had warned about for centuries is the arrogance of the intellect so because if you're if you're wise as well as smart and there is no relationship between being smart and being wise they are not the same thing there's no quick pathway from smart to wise and many of the people who I've known who were very wise were what some of them were intellectually impaired and were still wise you know so it's the arrogance that brings up the block and I see this for example happening in the United States in particular because the last time I went down there for example I was I had friends down there and and some of those friends are very very smart people and some of them were talking about the Trump voters and they were talking about the Trump voters with contempt and I thought you better watch that because that's 50% of the damn population and it might be convenient to think that they're stupid and beneath you but it's not conducive to a civil state and there's no evidence that it's true because there isn't a straight line between intelligent and wise and so I think that if you're if your character is developed and you're intelligent you can have your siloed creative community but you develop enough wisdom so that you can see all the things that people can do that are of high ethical utility that are outside the intellectual domain you know and I think that's why in the New Testament I think that's why Christ is a carpenter right because well first of all carpenter is one of those jobs that when you're dishonest it manifests itself immediately because what you build falls down and so if you're an honest carpenter you build a good house so that there's a nice metaphor there but it's also it's also a warning in some sense against the the equation of intellectual brilliance with moral superiority and so if the intellects would drop their moral superiority and fat chance there is of that then that divide between the working class say and the elite would would resolve and there's every reason to have respect for decent working class people I mean it's on their labour as the left wingers at least hypothetically agree that the entire edifice of the culture is is resting so you can have your cake and eat it too but you have to not assume that your niche makes you superior and it's very difficult for smart people especially smart there's a scene in leeches it seems thus spake Zarathustra wears arethusa the Prophet comes down from the mountain and he comes into a public square and there's this crowd around this little who's only about this high who have a gigantic ear and everyone is marveling at him well that's what the modern intellect is like it's a with a giant well mouth generally not an ear and the the the being is underdeveloped but the intellect is hyper activated and and it makes the person extraordinarily unbalanced and his part because they they can't compete outside the intellectual realm and that makes them very bitter because they tend to think well God I'm so smart everything should just come to me it's like sorry that's not how the world works and and it also that that and that that that attitude is immediately evident to people that they're talking to when they talk in the manner that they talk if they are arrogant intellectuals of that sort you see that in the Simpsons did a good job of that with comic book guy right I mean he completely useless in every possible dimension with an IQ of about 160 and it's very annoying to people who have an IQ of 160 that they can also be completely useless but it happens a lot so yeah hi dr."

    "text": "Peterson long time no see how are you doing thanks so I was up first going to ask about your thoughts on a very popular TV show Rick and Marty you know someone just recommended that to me and they said they thought I would find it funny and that makes me nervous because I like the Simpsons and I like the Trailer Park Boys for actually like the trailer I really liked the Trailer Park Boys and so someone said I know it's so sad you know but they said that I would like Rick and Morty so I'm kind of afraid to even watch it it does have a nihilistic theme to it no I would say so that which is quite telling of the young population which they flee they fall in love with it everyone's talking about it so uh-huh okay well I'll definitely watch it because I've been looking for something to watch when I'm brain dead at night so but I decide to tell them my question from a different angle if I may and it's about the case that governments let's say such as Russia and Iran they have any more extreme cases like Isis they do not want to conform to the nihilistic aspects of the West as a result they've taken an anti-western approach as someone with a Middle Eastern background I've been trying to figure out where the origins of this hostility more precisely comes from and why things are the way they are I recently found out that certain key Iranian philosophers and political activists were partially intuitively responsible for the 1979 Iranian Revolution were highly influenced by the anti Western high daguerreian philosophy and this is partially why they believed that an Islamic state would and it'd be messy and necessary counter position to the ninth nihilistic Western thought you I know that you also come there with Alexander dooking putting those liza yes except Dugan doesn't really seem to have a coherent answer he says that an answer like that is necessary and that hypothetically it's something that Russia might be able to offer but the details seem to me somewhat obscure I mean the Russians maybe the Russians are doing what Solzhenitsyn suggested and returning to Orthodox Christianity although Russia is corrupt enough so that it's very difficult to tell from the outside if that's mere collusion between the corrupt church in a corrupt state or if there's something genuine going on there now you know the I would say there's a question under your question which is tyranny or nihilism well that's a good question man that's a good question well lots of people would pick tyranny over nihilism and so if that's the only choice that people are offered then and I also think that tyranny is stronger than nihilism because what are you going to do organize nihilists hardly well look at look at what happened to what was that thing in Central Park you know against the 1% Jesus I mean what a dismal affair that was we'd like things to be different how well we don't know like so you know you can just run over that if you're tyrannical and organized you can just run over that like there's nothing there at all and that I think there is a danger and I do think that we're enticing the Islamofascists let's say by our nihilistic weakness and I think more than that I think that we're doing something more than that because one of the things that I've been curious about and I'm going way out on a limb here is I've been really interested in the alliance between the neo-marxist nihilistic are the neo-marxist postmodernists especially the feminists and the Islamofascists I just don't get that it's like there's something very very interesting going on there and I think part of it is that when you when you drift too far into the nihilistic sub structure there's a huge call for tyrannical order that manifests itself unconsciously and so that's the dynamic that I see playing out in that peculiar relationship between the modern neo-marxist feminists and Islamofascists I don't I don't know that's a very that's very interesting that that's a very interesting idea that you brought to mind I had no idea that there was a relationship between Heidegger and what happened in Iran in the 1970s if you could send me a citation about that or something to read I'd be very interested in doing that so okay yep yep [Applause] thank you that's that's that's the closest thing I think I'll experienced it out to arnold schwarzenegger actually delivering that line yeah the purrito distribution yeah yeah yeah not Ross but yeah do you have to work oh it's a nasty it's a nasty law yeah it was also known as prices law yeah yeah yeah yeah great yeah yeah yeah hopefully there's fewer of them than that okay two to two things the first is it isn't obvious what the population would be that you would compare this population to right because you could say well the boundary is the four hundred people in this room but it isn't necessarily the case the four hundred people in this room might be the square root of the broader population we're interested in this sort of thing but with the purrito distribution what you also see is that it's it's self similar and so let's say there's four hundred people doing something twenty of them are doing half the work but if you take twenty four of them are doing half the work of the twenty and one of the four is doing half the work of the four and so it's so why am I telling you that it's it isn't it well first of all it isn't that there isn't useful work to be done at multiple slices of the purrito distribution but the other thing is it's also the case that there's not only one purrito distribution right because you might say well if it's just the square root of the number of people in a domain that are doing half the work then you know what do you do with the rest of the people and the answer that might be well they're in a prio different preeto distribution as well where they're doing something productive so well I think it's a good question like we don't exactly end so so the basic rule is the look the basic rule is for example if you take a hundred scientists in a given domain ten of them will have published half the papers and this works with everything it works with with every creative domain the rule applies so now the question is why and I think the choir the answer to that seems to be and I've watched people who become spectacular ly successful it what happens is that zero is a really bad place to be right it's really hard to get out of zero and that's often why people are trapped in poverty because if you have nothing getting to something is virtually impossible once you have something getting to a little more of something is actually quite a bit easier and so what seems to happen this is also called the Mathieu principle right it's the same principle so that's a New Testament citation let's say the Mathieu principle is to those who have everything more will be given from those who have nothing everything will be taken that's another one of those lines in the New Testament that you'd think that a good editor would have just got rid of so but but but I think what it is is that every time you make a step forward the probability that you'll be able to take the next step forward increases and it seems to increase in a nonlinear way so the the world that the Mathieu principle describes is nonlinear you know so you might say well what's your trajectory if you're moving upward well it's not this it's this what's your trajectory if you're moving downward it's not this it's this right you fall you fall you plummet you rise you rise you transcend it's something like that and you might say well that's a hell of a world but whatever it has to be run by some principle and that's the principle that it appears to be run by yes no no no it doesn't mean that at all what it means is that every truth claim you make including those that are implicit in your actions carries with it an ethic that justifies or doesn't justify the action so for example let's say I have a tool and I say it's an axe and I go to the forest and I cut down I try to cut down a tree with it and it doesn't work it's not an axe it's something else and so what the what there's a good book on pragmatism called the metaphysical Club a history of American ideas it's what I would really recommend and what the pragmatists I can't give you a full answer because this is such a complicated issue but what the pragmatists were wrestling with back in the late 1800s the late 1800s this was William James and his crew in in Boston including a philosopher named CS purse who was perhaps America's greatest philosopher they were wrestling with the same issue that the postmodernist would wrestle with 100 years later which is things are indefinitely complex and we're not very bright so how is it that we can make claims to truth about anything and what they were what their their hypothesis essentially was is that with every action and with every truth claim you simultaneously demarcate a territory within which that claim is valid and you you determine whether the claim is valid by noting whether your prediction about the outcome of your action or your or your belief is commencer is is in keeping with if the outcome is in keeping with the prediction then what you've said or done is true or good enough and that's as good as you get and so that's the pragmatic perspective and then when when when the pragmatist encountered charles dark charles darwin's works works they immediately recognized that darwin had generated a pragmatic solution to the problem of the impossibility of being the impossibility of being is this there's way more cosmos than there is you you are going to die you cannot generate a sufficient solution to the problem of your being no one can nothing can it's like the environment is a snake that moves unpredictably across time and you're trying to stay on its back well as how how does the Darwinian process deal with that it produces infinite variance roughly speaking almost all of which die and that's how it solves the problem across time and the things that exist is the things that stay alive are true enough and that's the best you get that's the argument I was trying to have with Sam Harris because Harris doesn't take his evolutionary cycle is a Volusia nary theory seriously enough but we get to kept getting bogged down anyways that's that's the best answer oh I'd like to agree with that but it's not true yeah yep yep yep you really do like to ask hard questions so you I think it depends see this is also why like the pH alien take let's say on on pragmatism because I think that pragmatism as a philosophy has the limitation that you just described but only if you think about the games as limited if you have to play the game in an iterative way then that issue resolves itself and the game theorists have done a good job of mapping that out it's like you could say let's say pragmatically speaking there's no reason I shouldn't deceive you once if I can get what I want it's yeah yeah except that I'm probably not only going to interact with you once I'm going to interact with you a lot and even if it isn't you that I interact with it's going to be a bunch of beings that are so much like you that it might as well be you might as well be you it's going to be me if nothing else and so the pragmatic game stretched across time would include the necessity of iterability in relationship to the validations of the truth claims that's that's how it looks to me I'm gonna I'm gonna I'm gonna stop you if we have say that again yes yes thank you yes but that's not all I am so this is on behalf of somebody dr."

    "text": "Peterson having listened to your expositions on the mythological evolution and amalgamation of religion and keeping in mind your working definitions of belief and truth and despite the obvious reasons for somebody of your background to identify most with Christianity my understanding is that you believe Christianity to be the most complete and articulated form of many of the metaphysical ideas that preceded it and led up to that keeping that in mind would it also be accurate to therefore say that you're not only a believer in Christianity but also if to a lesser degree also believer in in Mourdock in the ancient Egyptian gods and the subsequent gods that you've spoken up here that led up and contribute it to the form of Christianity that you're discussing and that you identify with okay I'm going to take that one apart a little bit I'm bounded in my judgment with regards to Christianity by my ignorance I'm no student of Hinduism so I can't make the claim forthrightly that there's something intrinsically superior to the judeo-christian tradition because I don't know enough to make that claim the claim I can make is that there's something that's dreadfully right about this core elements of the judeo-christian tradition and I've seen analogues to that like one of the things I'd like to do for example is to do a short series on the Delta H Inc because that is one remarkable document once you know especially you might want to read it you can go online and read it's very short out etching ta o teh CH ing and it's the fundamental text of Taoism and once you know that the world of being is made of chaos and order and you know that that's represented by the yin and the yang all of a sudden you can understand the DAO de Jing and it's just it's brilliantly simple and straightforward in it's exposition but it also seems to me to be entirely commensurate with the line of of let's call it logic it's more like a the the mode of description of being that's encapsulated in these stories now with regards to being a believer people ask me all the time two things say do you believe in God and are you a Christian and they answered without both of those is actually there's two answers one is what the hell makes you think it's any of your business that's the first answer and the second is why do you think that you mean the same thing with those questions that I would mean with my answer so you know what because it's such a funny thing because I spent like three and this is no accusation with regards to your questions in the least you know I think it's more about trying to detract the development of these ideas and you know the residual truth and so yeah psychological significance of all these other traditions I think well you know I did I've been there floored by other mythological structures like when I first understood or thought I understood the meaning of the Mesopotamian creation method just I've never recovered from that I would say and the same thing is true of the investigations I did into the Egyptian myths of Horus and Isis and Osiris and Seth it's just a and they're they're so relevant I mean they're so unbelievably relevant and how do how do see this is a problem that none of us really know how to solve it's like they're our sources of wisdom all over the world let's say and they need to be made commensurate with one another which isn't to say that they need to be turned into a fast-food mall you know that's that's like multiculturalism right it's like all the food of the world served in the most terrible possible manner all in one place and something like that and you don't want to do that with comparative religion it's just water everything down and say well it's all nice it's like no it is not nice yeah or that it's all the same because it's not all the same so the the job of communicating between those domains of wisdom is really continuing right it's been a problem ever since the beginning of civilization but it's continuing and I would say the psychoanalyst Jung in particular was took to huge huge steps in in the direction of doing that an extraordinarily positive way and not a simple minded way at all and not just hand waving that oh well it's everyone has one and all shall have prizes not that so yeah last question I choose it kind of in the same vein but it's in regards to another kind of mythology so yeah in terms of I guess Carl Jung's own with us sorry I'm extremely tall but a lot of the I achieved I found some kind of archetypes like for example in my own life but also I've noticed in European life so for example in regards to Odin and Norse mythology yeah with Corleone si I've only been able to actually skim it because I've been like trying to find something like because I felt like there's always this kind of psyche that was almost underneath I guess Western civilization and we see it really like embodied in this specific figure this deity the wanderer the knowledge gatherer the seeker but he's also a war goddess these all these different aspects that are an accumulation of what seems to be something that's distinctly Western mm-hm and I feel this is like almost like this symbol in a way of course it's not always followed there seems to be something maybe there seems to be something I do think that the idea of the individual has been articulated most fully in the West I don't think that's really a I don't think that's a contentious claim actually that doesn't mean that the latent structures from which that idea might emerge weren't also many other places simultaneously and the other thing from let's say from a biological perspective is that we're only talking about differences of a few hundred years in terms of the manifestation of these ideas right from from an evolutionary perspective that's it's instantaneous it's like well a new idea has to arise somewhere so is going to be somewhere first and but it's spreading I mean Christianity for example spread so rapidly that it's absolutely beyond belief and it is actually spreading more rapidly in China now than it did in ancient Rome so well in regards to that it's also been seen like almost in the wake of a dying Christianity I've noted that like there's been a tendency to go towards I guess paganism right yes I understand the like some people laugh at all yes we have Wicca which was mainly a manifestation of Aleister Crowley in his works which were then ended off to whoever actually made the actual ideology and then next thing you know we're finding something almost more stable in I guess Norse mythology and it seems like it's acting almost as a pendulum school swing from something that well people are good like the thing is is when one when one mythological structure collapses it's going to collapse into another mythological structure or another set of mythological structures and and because you can't get out of the mythological structures there's no possible way of doing that what and so I wouldn't say necessarily that the fact that other belief systems emerge in the aftermath of the collapse of the overarching belief system I don't think that that's necessarily a bad idea I think that it has its attendant dangers and so I should stop because I'm starting to get tired and I'm not going to be able to formulate any clearer answers than that and it's also 10 o'clock so we also do have to stop oh yes there is an unofficial Meetup and discussion group at Hemingway's restaurant second floor 142 Cumberland Street just say you're with the Jordan Peterson discussion group yes everyone is invited if you say you're with the Jordan Peterson discussion group please don't misbehave too badly

    "text": "[Music] thank you very much hahahaha thank you very much for showing up again that's a really good to see everybody here so one of the things that I've been realizing as a consequence of going through these stories is that the degree to which they're about individuals is quite remarkable and I think that's really telling you know one of the reasons I prefer Dostoevsky to Tolstoy is because Tolstoy is more of a sociologist he's more interested in the relationship between groups of people this is an oversimplification because obviously Tolstoy is a great author but I like dusty husky better because he really delves into the souls of individuals and I think it's remarkable the degree to which all of the stories that we've covered so far in Genesis are about individuals and they're quite realistic which is quite remarkable - they're not really romanticized to any great degree because all of the people that are regard as regarded let's say as patriarchal or matriarchal figures in Genesis have no shortage of ethical if no shortage of ethical flaws and also no shortage of difficulties in their life and the difficulties are realistic there they're major-league problems you know like familial catastrophes and famine and war and revenge and hatred and all those things it's not a it's not a pretty it's not a pretty book and that's one of the things that makes it great I mean that's one of the things that characterizes great literature right is that it doesn't present you with a whitewashed view of humanity or of existence and that's really a relief I think because as you all know because you're alive there's no such thing as a whitewash existence like you're to be alive is to be in trouble ethically and existentially I've been reading this book recently I'll talk about it a little bit later it's called better never to have a bean and it was written by a philosopher in South Africa in Cape Town name Benatar that's his last name and he basically argues I think it's a specious argument and I think it's artificially constructed but he basically argues that because life is so full of suffering even good lives are very much full of suffering that it's wrong to bring children into the world because the suffering outweighs the good even in good lives and it's actually wrong it would also be better not to exist for exactly the same reason and my sense in reading the book is that he came to that conclusion and then wrote the book to justify it which is actually the reverse of the way that you should write a book what you should do when you're writing a book is you should have a question and you should it should be a real question right it should be one you don't know the answer to and then you should be studying and writing like mad and reading everything you can get your hands on to see if you can actually grapple with the problem and come to some solution and you should walk the reader as well through your process of thinking so that they can come to the well not necessary to the same conclusion but at least track what you're doing and I don't think that's what he did I think he wrote it backwards but then and so I was thinking about it a lot because that's actually a question that I've contended with in my writing there are Memphis da Philly and our satanic figures for example in girth is Faust and also Ivan in in that in the brothers karamasoff who basically make the same case you know that existence is so rife with trouble and suffering that it would be better if it didn't exist at all and the problem I've had with that there's a variety of them but one of the problems I've had with that is what happens if you start to think that way because what I've observed is that people who begin to think that way that isn't where they stop like that they get angry at existence which is what happened to Cain as we saw in the Cain and Abel story and then the next step is to start taking revenge against existence and that cascades until it's revenge against well I think the best way of thinking about it is revenge against God for the crime of being which is I think the deepest sort of hatred that can entertain and and and when you're in the grip of a really deep emotion like a really profound emotion right at the bottom of emotions you're in something that's like a quasi-religious state and that's more or less independent of your belief saying a transcendent deity I mean you can be in a profoundly emotional state that's as deep as it can be and it can have religious significance without that necessarily signifying anything about a transcendent being you know but but then I was thinking you see the problem with that argument is you can gerrymander it endlessly you know because first of all how do you measure suffering and how do you measure happiness it's like how do you assign weights to them and god there's just no way of doing that you have to do it arbitrarily and so you can make an argument that the suffering outweighs the happiness you just wait the suffering more heavily than you wait the happiness and that's the end of that you know and so that's that's a problem but I think there's a deeper problem and I was reading this other book while back as well which was written by the guy who ran the human genome project and I don't remember exactly what it was called but it was something like a scientists case for God is something like that and one of the things he referred to which didn't strike me as hard as it should have to begin with was the he thought that one of the phenomena say that justified a belief in a transcendent being was something like the moral intuition of human beings that you know we have a sense of right and wrong and you know it's certainly in what happens in Genesis in the story of Adam and Eve is that that that story announces the coming of the sense of right and wrong right the knowledge of good and evil and it isn't something we ascribe to animals it's something that's unique to human beings animals can be predators and you know and they can be gentle and and you can have a relationship with them but you never think of an evil cat or you know or an evil wolf even though they're you know they're predatory about human beings we have this capacity to judge between good and evil right and wrong and it's really an integral part of our being and I think you can make an evolutionary case for that a biological case for that as you can make a biological case for most of what is relevant about human beings because we're biological creatures but we don't really understand the significance of that like what happens in the story of Adam and Eve is that that's that realization not coming to the knowledge of good and evil is actually represented as a shift of cosmic significance right it puts a it puts a permanent fracture in the structure of being and you know if you think of human beings as insignificant ants on a tiny dust mote in the middle of an infinite cosmos cosmos that cares less for us then who cares fundamentally if human beings have the knowledge to distinguish between good and evil but if you give consciousness a central role in being and you can make a perfectly reasonable case for that because without consciousness there's no being as far as anyone can determine so it may be much more central than we think and and I really don't think there's a counter-argument to that like not a solid one you can state that consciousness is epiphenomena land and that the world is fundamentally materialistic and it doesn't matter that there's consciousness you can state that but you can make an equally credible case the other way and certainly our lived experience is that consciousness is crucial obviously and we treat each other as if most of the time we're valuable conscious beings and we wouldn't give up our consciousness even though it's often consciousness of suffering and so then I think another problem with the book is that it's it's sort of predicated on the idea that life is for happiness and I don't think that's right and I don't think that's how people experience life and I might be wrong but it seems to me that people experience life as something like a series of crucial ethical decisions it's something like that I mean when I just can't imagine maybe I'm being naive about this but I can't imagine that I can't imagine another being that's like me in in most senses that isn't constantly wrestling in some sense with what the next proper thing to do is it's not like it's obvious it's not bloody obvious and it doesn't mean you'll do the right thing because you don't law lots of times and you know that by your own judgement right because you're making mistakes all the time sometimes you don't know what you're doing and maybe it's a mistake and maybe it isn't and who's to say that isn't what I'm talking and what I'm talking about when you know that what you're doing is wrong and you go ahead and do it anyways people do that all the time and that's also extremely peculiar you bloody well think that if you knew it was wrong and you told yourself that it was wrong that that would be sufficient so that you just wouldn't do it but that isn't what you're like at all you know and you can tell yourself something is wrong a fifty times and you'll do it the 51st time and then you'll feel you know like like you deserve to feel probably and but it doesn't stop you and so so then I think the other problem with the viewpoint the idea that the suffering of life eradicate sits utility is that it's predicated on the idea that happiness or lack of suffering even is is the right criteria by which to judge life and I don't think that's how we actually experience life I think what we do instead is put ourselves through a series of excruciating moral choices you know when one of the things that that's really significant about the biblical stories and I think about the the entire implicit philosophy you know that's embedded in the stories is that that's how life is presented in in the stories is all of these individuals first they're individuals - not groups and second they're agonizing over their moral choices all the time all the time and they have a relationship with God and but it's not a it's not a directive relationship exactly even for the people to whom God speaks directly which I suspect is not something you'd exactly want to have happen is it's there's still even the fact that they have a direct relationship with God doesn't stop them from being tormented continually by their moral choices and so the world is presented as a moral landscape not as a not as a place that justifies itself by happiness it's presented as a moral landscape and people are presented as preachers who traverse through the moral landscape making ethical decisions that determine the course of the world and that seems to me to be right and that's not a that's not the same as happiness by any stretch of the imagination it's a whole different category of being and you know and then I thought that through a lot and I think well we do make choices and what we do is contend with the future you know and that the future seems to appear to us as a realm of possibility that's a more accurate way of thinking about it then then that the future presents itself to it to us as a realm of determined things it's it's presents itself as a realm of possibility and there's good choices in that realm and there's poor choices or even evil choices in that realm and we're negotiating continually deciding which of those choices we're going to bring into being that seems to me to be phenomenologically indisputable and we certainly treat each other as if that's what we're doing because we hold each other responsible for our actions you know with some exceptions and that we're deciding each moment whether to make things better or worse and that seems to me to be correct and I think that that's what these stories illustrate they don't say that directly you know although I think it gets more and more explicit as the narrative unfolds but and then part of the realism of the stories is that the people aren't the people that are being presented are by no means good I mean maybe with the exception of Noah no one seemed to be a pretty good guile they did he did get drunk and you know and and end up naked exposed to his sons and so forth and but I mean he isn't talked about a lot as a character it's a pretty compressed story but Abraham I mean Abraham had plenty of problems not least of which was in his inability to leave home and then you know his lying about his wife and their there's all sorts of mistakes and then Jacob who were going to talk about tonight is an even more morally ambivalent character he's especially at the beginning of the story he's it's it's he isn't the sort of person that you would pick out especially if you were a hack writer you wouldn't pick him out as the hero of the story he does a lot of things that are really pretty reprehensible and takes him an awful long time to learn better and yet he's the person who's put forward as the father of the 12 tribes of Israel it's from this flawed person that the people that that may be that whose story you might say is that the fundamental constitutes the fundamental underpinning of our culture it's it's from this deeply flawed individual that that group emerges and so you might think of that as a relief to because you know you're no knight in shining armor you know with with a with a pure moral past I mean people make mistakes of catastrophic proportions non-stop you know and that also means that these stories put forward something approximating hope because in their realism in their moral realism they present heroes I suppose the heroes of renown right the patriarchs of old let's say who are realistic people who have fits of anger and rage and who are murderous at times and who are deeply deeply embroiled with family dispute and and who who have adulterous affairs and and like they do all the terrible things that people do and the weird thing is is that God is still with them and you know it isn't obvious what that means or even if it means anything but it's very it's not disputable as far as I can tell that a were conscious and that consciousness is a transcendent phenomena which which we do not understand and that the landscape that we traverse through is moral like every story you ever watch anything that grips your imagination on the screen or in the theater like any story that grabs you is a story of moral striving it's just not interesting otherwise right the person has to be confronted with complex moral choices and then you see the outcome and you know the good guy doesn't and the bad guy does it badly and things don't go so well for the bad guy generally and if it's a bit more sophisticated than good and the bad are in the same individual and that's you know that's a more compelling story but so we could say well let's we could make the assumption that it might be worthwhile thinking of the world as a as it has been thought of classically as a theater upon which the forces of good and evil continually strive for dominance and I for the life of me especially after I started reading deeply into 20th century history and all the terrible things that happened in the 20th century and all the terrible unbelievably incomprehensible things that people did to one another I just couldn't see seeing things any other way is realistic you know because I don't think that you can immerse yourself in 20th century history without coming to the conclusion that evil is a reality and if it's a reality that it depends on what you mean by reality but it's fundamental enough reality for me and if it's a reality then I don't see how you can escape from the conclusion that the cosmos as we experience it at least is a place of moral striving and well that's one of the things that's really illustrated in the story of Jacob and and I found that quite striking so so the last time last lecture I ended with the Abrahamic stories with the death of Sarah and that was Abraham's wife and so we're gonna continue from from there remember Abraham had a son Isaac and he was asked by God to sacrifice his son which we talked about in in some depth and I was attempting to make the case that you know the idea of sacrifice was one of humankind's great discoveries because it meant the discovery of the future essentially but it also meant the discovery that the future was something that you could make a bargain with and that you could give up something now something impulsive some pleasure even a deep pleasure in the moment and you could strive and hypothetically you could make a covenant a bargain with the future and if your sacrifices were acceptable and that seemed to mean an ethically acceptable you had to sacrifice the right thing that that vastly increased the probability that not only you would be successful let's say but that your descendants would be too and I don't think that that's an irrational proposition I mean you have to leave in it a bit with the realization that sometimes you know you get sliced off at the knees no matter what right because life has an arbitrary element and and that can't be tossed out but building in the arbitrary element will say you still want to think well what's your best bet given a certain amount of randomness and it seems to me that conscious self-aware sacrifice and proper ethical striving is your best bet and you know there's another idea that well I've always explained it when I've explained it to people I've always used the movie Pinocchio as an example you know that when Geppetto was trying to make his puppet into a self-aware and autonomous moral agent which is what he wants above all else you know he aims at the highest good that he can conceive which is the star that he prays to essentially and hopes for the transformation and there's also something in that that's unutterably profound and maybe that is somewhat independent of the idea that you have to believe in God I would also say that what it means to believe in God in the old testament is by no means clear and that's something I also really want to talk about tonight it's not obvious what it means and well Gepetto what he does at least is aim at the highest good of which he can conceive you know and that that's actually in a philosophical definition of God upon occasion that God is the highest good of which you conceive and you know that's different than the idea of a transcendent being precisely but it's in line with it's in line with certain interesting psychoanalytic speculations this is one of the things I really liked about Carl Jung you know Jung was so radical a thinker it's just beyond belief like I've read a lot of critics of you and I've always I've always got too kicked out of them because the things they accused Jung of are so trivial compared to the things that Jung actually did that it's like accusing a murderer of jaywalking like because Jung was unbelievably radical like here's one of his ideas you know he thought that it was necessary he believed that psychotherapy could be replaced by a supreme moral effort and so the moral effort would be something like aiming after good and then trying to integrate yourself around that and that the the good at which you aimed would be something approximating what you would be like if you manifested your full potential and that you have a glimmering of what that full potential was so that would be the potential future you and he thought of that he thought of people as four dimensional entities especially essentially that were stretched across time and that you as a totality across time including your potential manifested yourself also in the here and now and that part of what your potential manifested itself was something like the voice of conscious conscience or intuition it's amazing idea it's an amazing idea right because it's like what you could be in the future beckons to you in the present and helps you determine the difference between good and evil it's a mind-boggling idea and you know I think that it's an idea you have to contend with and then he went further than that and this is this is also remarkable idea you know he was interested in this symbolic representation of Christ and I mean psychologically speaking and he thought of Christ as the representation of the ideal potential human it's something like that so it was a symbolic rip thats what Christ was is a symbolic representation of the ideal potential of a human being and so for young there was no difference between there was no psychological difference between who you could be in the future beckoning to you and the prey in the present and orienting yourself in relationship to Christ psychologically those were the same thing and then so that's a pretty mind-boggling idea like seriously that's a mind-boggling idea you know especially when you add the psychological idea that the one of the things that characterizes your ideal future self is the ability to make sacrifices right and the deeper the sacrifice the better and then also to recover from the sacrifice right so that's the death and rebirth so the part of you that's most essential to your full flowering as a as a being is your ability to let things go and then spring back from that so to die in some sense and to be reborn in the service of a higher good and then well then the next part of that is that the direction of the world depends on you doing that so not only your own life but your family's life and and because we're networked so intently together you know that the whole panoply of humankind that may be the structure of the of the cosmos and you know you might think well no but you know it's not so simple it's not so simple first of all one person can wreak an awful lot of havoc there's absolutely no doubt about that and as we get more technologically powerful that becomes even more relevant and important and and and crucial you know one of the things that Young said was that we had to wake up because we are too technologically powerful to be as morally asleep as we are and that seems to me just to be self-evident that's yeah for sure that's true we're we're we're half asleep with nuclear bombs it's not a good idea it's seriously not a good idea and so well and then you might ask yourself - you don't well like what is the ultimate potential of a fully developed human being and well we certainly know that you have admiration for people who are more developed rather than less developed that's that just happens automatic or resentment that but that's okay it's the same thing it doesn't matter but it's not like you can't identify them you can identify them you know and and they're put forward to you in in in drama and fiction and all of that constantly so that's another form of moral intuition you know you can write you can discern the wheat from the chaff let's say and and so the other thing that I was thinking about that's worth consideration too is that you know and maybe this is maybe this is petty but I don't think it is somebody asked me the other day if I believed in miracles and I hate being asked questions like that you know and you know it's also people ask me do I believe in God and like I don't know what they mean when they say that and so I don't know what the answer because I don't think we're talking necessarily going to talk about the same thing but in any case I said yes and I have a variety of reasons for that but one of them is that you know the consensus among physicists is that we can track the origin of the cosmos to something like a hundred millionth of a millionth of a second after the Big Bang it's like it's so close to the Big Bang that the difference is literally infinitesimal but the consensus is that before that whatever that is the laws of physics themselves break down well what what do you call an event that exists outside the laws of physics that by definition that's a miracle now that doesn't necessarily mean that there's a transcendent Adi that caused the event that's a separate issue but it does imply a barrier of some sort beyond which we can't go where some other set of rules apply and so I find that interesting as well so all right so Sarah dies and Abraham makes a bargain with the Hittites to purchase a burial place for her and they offer it as a gift and he insists upon paying for it it's a little story that basically indicates two things that Abraham was the kind of guy that you trust pretty much when you see him and that even if something is offered to him as a gift he's going to do everything to be reciprocal about it and and so it's not a massively important part of the story but it's it's in keeping with the same narrative flow and so Efron who's a hit I'd offer Zabar you'll place as a gift and Abraham says no you know you have to let me pay for it and Efrain says he will and that works out very well and so he has a good burial place for his wife and then Abraham decides that Isaac needs a wife and so he sends his eldest servant to Mesopotamia to find a wife for Isaac and there's a strange ritual that's performed so it says in the story that the servant places his hand under Abraham's thigh to to swear but that isn't really what it means it means that he places his hand I don't know exactly how to say this properly well use your imagination how about that and the idea is that as far as I can tell that he's swearing on the future he's swearing on future people it's something like that so that's that's sort of what testified means right think about the route well I'm not kidding I'm not kidding that is what it that's that is the derivation right it is the derivation so so so anyways this is a serious issue and so that servant has to go and find Isaac a good wife and he wants him to find Isaac wife who is willing to accept the same fundamental belief system which is something like the belief in a god that's a unity rather than a plurality you know the other thing that Jung was very insistent upon was that there was a relationship between polytheism and psychological confusion and monotheism and psychological unification I really like that idea too that you know that what you're trying to do because you are a plurality that that's one of the things the psychoanalysts we're really good at figuring out that the cognitive scientists haven't touched yet as far as I could tell they're way behind the psychoanalysts in that element of thinking is that you are composed of sub personalities which all have their own desires and their own viewpoint their own thoughts and their own perceptions and they're in a war with each other constantly maybe even a Darwinian war it's been it's been portrayed that way by certain neuroscientists and that that one of the goals of life is to integrate all of that plurality into a hierarchical ethical structure that has some canonical ethic at the pinnacle right we've talked a little bit about that and it's not obvious what should be at the pinnacle but we can guess at it it's it's that which we admire that's one way of thinking about it it's that that describes fair play across a sequence of games that's another good way of thinking about it it's it's the heroic ideal that's another way of thinking about it but it's it's combined with generosity you know because the hero the mythological hero goes out into the unknown and slays the dragon and gets the gold but then comes back to the community and distributes what's found and so it's courage plus generosity and and so all of your all of that interior struggling that you're doing is an attempt to bang yourself against the world with challenge constantly to hit everything together like you're beating on a piece of iron to to to cure it let's say so that you don't you're not an internal contradiction you're not massive competing gods something like that because it's just too psychologically stressful and hard on everyone else and impossible for them to get along with you if you're one thing one moment and another thing another moment and so so anyways Abraham insists that Isaac find a wife from among people who are likely to carry off forward the monotheistic tradition and I'm not sure that the monotheistic tradition is actually indistinguishable is actually distinguishable from the individualistic tradition I think they might be the same thing at different levels of analysis you know so because individual means undivided in some sense right to be an individual means to be one thing and the other thing that mitigates against the idea of life as happiness is it isn't obvious to me that it's happiness that is what molds you and shapes you you know it's something more like optimal challenge voluntarily undertaken it's something like that right and I think that's echoed in the idea that everyone has a moral obligation to raise their cross something like that to accept the fact of their mortality voluntarily I believe that that's the case and I do actually think that that's a prerequisite to proper psychological development because if you're not willing to take your mortality on voluntarily like if you're kicking and fighting about it constantly and you have every reason to don't get me wrong then you can't act forthrightly in the world right you're going to be afraid and when you're afraid then you can't voluntarily take on a challenge and then if you can't take voluntarily take on a challenge then you can't develop and so again the life seems to be something like if it's a proper life is the voluntarily voluntary taking on of great challenges and maybe that's better than happiness like it's certainly more noble you know it's not a word we use very much anymore the idea of nobility because we're so obsessed with happiness but I think happiness is a like if it comes along man great you know wonderful don't don't take it lightly or for granted because it's fleeting but the idea that that's what you should be for in some sense - seems to me if that's what life is for then maybe it shouldn't be maybe that's correct because that isn't what life is but so doesn't it isn't obvious to me that that's what life should be you know I mean if you really loved someone like like your son let's say what do you say well I hope he has a happy life or would you say I hope he accomplishes great things it seems to me that that's better the accomplishing of great things and because that's admirable you know it's like a happy person is a happy person but a noble person is an admirable person and and that's that's better man and so maybe there are better things than happiness and so you can't judge being on the basis of the ratio of suffering to pleasure something like that it's and I don't think we do that I don't believe we do that I mean comedians are happy right but everyone doesn't aspire to be a comedian and you don't watch comedy all the time even though you could laugh non-stop more or less if the comedian's funny you want to get your teeth into something it also seems to me that this is one of the reasons I like the existential philosophy was that you know the existentialist believed it's sort of an original sin idea they believed that we came into the world with an ethical burden already laden upon us something like something like that and that we had a felt sense that it was necessary for us to justify our being and if we didn't do that then we weren't authentic to ourselves we weren't moving towards individuality we weren't sustaining the community we weren't living properly and that and that that idea was deeply embedded in people as part of their ordinary experience and that also seems to me to be accurate and you know I've dealt with lots of people say in my clinical practice and they don't really cut they are they will come and say I wish I wasn't so unhappy but they don't usually come and say I wish I was happier and those things aren't the same and and then when we when you talk to people who are having trouble you know they want to straighten things out and figure out how to do them right it's something like that and and that that's the primary that's their primary goal and so anyways Abraham sends his eldest servant off to his the place that God has granted him to find a wife and interestingly the borders of the promised land are quite similar to the current borders of Israel in these are estimates right based on on the biblical and I mean that's not a fluke obviously but it's it's interesting to see the concordance between these ancient stories and the present-day world so I thought that was very interesting and it shows once again that the past you think the past is the past but it's not it's it's still here it's embedded in the present you know just like the future and somehow in some ways is folded up inside the present waiting to unfold the past is all folded up inside the present too so anyways the servant goes to the land that he's been charged to go to and and he's trying to figure out how in the world am I going to find a good wife for Isaac I mean I don't know any of these people and so he has this little dialogue that's presented in the form of a prayer I suppose and he thinks well I'm gonna go to the place where you water where people get water and water the animals and because that's a place where everyone gathers so that's a good place to find someone and and it's it's not a place of fun and lightness and relaxation and impulsivity it's a place of life-sustaining work and and he thinks something like well what would a decent girl do at a watering place and he thought well maybe she would offer a stranger some water and also offer to water the camels because that would be brave to approach the stranger and then generous and then indicative of the willingness to make an effort and when you know that a camel I think he took ten camels was quite a few camels anyways just one and that a camel can drink 20 gallons of water and Rebecca who was drawing water from the wet turns out to be Rebecca I was drawing water from the well which is hard right because water is heavy and you have to lift it up and it's ten camels and so that's like 200 gallons of waters so you know she has to put herself out a fair a bit in order to make this stranger happy and so that's what happens and then the servant has brought along gifts and that sort of thing and anyways to make a long story short Rebecca agrees to come back to come back with the servant and huh marry Isaac and so then she has she gets pregnant and she has twins and this is an interesting thing the twins fight inside her she can tell that that they're not getting along and this is an echo right it's an echo of Cain and Abel and there's a mythological motif that the unions have called the hostile brothers the hostile brothers and you see them all the time Batman and the Joker are hostile brothers and Thor and Loki or hostile brothers and it's an unbelievably common motif and you know the ultimate hostile brothers are Christ and Satan so that's the that's the archetypal representation of the hostile brothers right the ultimate good and the ultimate evil and so and so it's an echo of the cain and abel story although it's a little more complex I would say from a literary point of view because it isn't obvious which of these brothers is Cain and which of them is Abel they have parts of both in each of them so Esau who turns out to be one of the brothers in Jacob movie turns out to be the other both have their admirable qualities and their faults anyways Esau comes is born first but Jacob has him by the heel and so there was a fight within the womb to see who would emerge first now that's relevant because the firstborn had a special status well has a special status in many communities especially agricultural communities and there's a reason all these people were more herds people but if you divide your property equally among all your children then in like three generations everybody has one goat and everybody starves to death you know or the same thing happens with lands so one of the ways that that traditional communities solve that is they just give them almost everything to the firstborn and then the everyone else knows well you go out and do whatever you can and it's kind of arbitrary and unfair but you know at least it's predictably arbitrary and unfair instead of doom over for generations you know so it actually mattered to be the firstborn and and God generally favors the firstborn and then you might think well what is it about being born first that's so relevant apart from the the cultural practice of abort generous inheritance and I would say well the firstborn is something like the model for the leader of the family right because the firstborn child should be if there's a number of siblings they should take care of the siblings at least to some degree but also should be a role model for them so it's like a natural position of leadership but there's a site there's a cycle psychologize ation of the idea of the firstborn in these stories because god often passes over the firstborn in favor of a later born child he seems to do that on the basis of moral character essentially and so there's this idea that well there's a natural proclivity towards leadership that's just a biological fact that would be associated with being a firstborn but there's a element of characterological development that transcends that and so that you it's more important to be spiritually a firstborn let's say than to be biologically a firstborn and God recognizes that continually in these stories and inverts the natural order and favors a later born who's who's done more work with regards to characterological development and that's also interesting to you know I've talked to lots of business people about leadership and there's a literature on leadership but it's not a good literature it's it's pretty shallow partly because it's not that easy to define leadership and partly because there are different you know you people have different temperaments and different temperaments can be leaders they just do it in different ways now there's something in common about being a leader though and I would say one is that if you're an actual leader you actually know where you're going right because what are you gonna do lead people in circles it's like maybe they'll follow you but you're not a leader you're just a charlatan so you have to know where you're going and then you have to be able to communicate that and then people have to trust you so you actually have to be honest because people are at that stupid at least not for a long period of time and then where you're going has to have some value because otherwise why would anyone want to go along with you so and then you might say well what what are the attributes then that make you a leader and I would say well they're characterological fundamentally and this is not naive optimism or or or casual moralizing it has nothing to do with that you know we know for example that conscientiousness that the personality trait is a good predictor of long-term success in in most occupations not all but most and that one of the things that's associated with conscientiousness is that people keep their word they're trustworthy and that's certainly one element of a leader especially across any reasonable amount of time you have to be able to trust the person they can even be harsh right it doesn't matter because you can see harsh leaders and kind leaders but as long as they do what they say they will do then then you can follow them and you know that the future payoff is is is secure something like that so the idea that character logical development is more important to leadership than primogenitor I think that's the right word primal Genesis anyways being a firstborn that's a very crucial psychological realization that it's character logical development that makes you favored of God you know and I do think we've forgotten this in many ways because there isn't a lot of emphasis in our education system on characterological development and that's very very surprising to me I think maybe it's partly because in our fractured society we can't agree on what constitutes a reasonable characterological goal so we just throw up our hands and don't educate our kids to any degree at all especially in schools about what an admirable person is like or even let them know that well maybe you should actually try to be one you know that that's actually the most important possible thing that you could learn right [Applause] so and I also think and I think this is laid out very thoroughly in the biblical stories as well is that if there are enough people who are admirable then things work and if there aren't and things things are terrible you get wiped out you remember when Abraham is bargaining with God with regards to Sodom and Gomorrah he asks God to save the city if there's like 40 admirable people right respectable but let's say admirable right I don't want I don't want to say good because good is being corrupted in some sense by casual usage I mean admirable noble people right I think Abraham bargains got down to like ten if there's ten of them in the city the city won't be destroyed and that that's not very many in this city so there's an interesting idea there which is that there there doesn't have to be that many people in a group who have their act together but zero is the wrong number and if it's zero then then we're seriously in trouble and I think that goes along with the idea of the Pareto principle in economics too which is that it's a small minority of people who do most of the productive work in any given domain but so so a small number of properly behaving people might have enough of an impact to keep everything moving and that might also that might actually be true but it can't fall below some crucial level and I do think that we're in some danger of allowing it to fall below some crucial level because our society seems to be at war in some ways against the idea of the individual and individual character per se and I think that's absolutely I think that's absolutely catastrophic and that's part of the reason that I'm doing these biblical lectures you know because I think that I've known for a long time that the moral presuppositions of a culture are instantiated in its stories they're not instantiated in its explicit philosophy there might be a layer of explicit philosophy and of course there is in the West and a layer of explicit law but underneath that there are stories and there isn't anything under the stories except maybe behavior you know and that's so implicit it doesn't even actually count it's not a cognitive operation and so this is the story these are the stories that are underneath our culture and so there better be something to them that's what we hope and but more importantly maybe we shouldn't toss them away without knowing what they mean because if we toss them away then we're throwing everything that we depend on away as far as I can tell and we'll we will pay for it we'll pay for it individually because we'll be weak you know because if you're not firm in your convictions then someone else who's firm in their convictions can you're their puppet like instantly and then you're also the puppet of your own doubts right because unless you have convictions you're gonna generate doubts like mad because everyone does and then the doubts win and and you'll be paralyzed because there'll be you know 50% of you moving forward and 50% of you frozen stiff and that'll be enough just to lodge you in place and so okay so there's a psychologize ation of the idea of leadership which is very important and then it's associated with the idea of character or logical development and it's associated with the idea of struggle not happiness and it's also associated with this Abrahamic idea which I really liked and which was something that's been very useful to me as a consequence of doing these lectures because remember at the beginning of the Abrahamic stories abraham's like a stay-at-home guy right he's like the guy who's 40 years old living in his in his in his mother's basement and god says like get the hell out of there you know get out in the world where you belong go do something difficult because what you're doing isn't acceptable and you know the first thing he does is go somewhere there's a terrible famine and then he goes somewhere there's a tyranny so you know it's it's pretty funny he follows God's call and it's not like sweetness and light and paradise immediately it's nothing like that it's it's instantaneous combat you know of the most difficult kind so but but Abraham does in fact follow that impulse and you know it's interesting too I mean I don't know here's another thing that made me a really an advocate of psychoanalytic thinking and it was the sort of thing that started to terrify me about what the human psyche was out like I started to understand that not only were we like an amalgam of relatively autonomous subpersonalities each of which had the possibility of gaining control but that we were also victim you might say or beneficiary of impulses that were beyond our conscious formulation or or or understanding or capacity to resist so here's this here's a funny story so I was talking to one of my patreon people online this week and he said he was a committed atheist and that's fine you know lots of atheists are very honest people and they're atheists because they don't know how to reconcile what they know with traditional claims let's say and they're not willing to just mangle them together you know and there might be cynicism all that associated with it as well but he said he was he said he was entranced by these biblical lectures you know which is pretty weird and he said if someone would have told him a year ago that he was going to like be obsessed with the sequence of biblical lectures he would have told them that they were mad and so we had a bit of a discussion about that and because this is an interesting thing you know and he mentioned this he said it was something like you don't choose your interests they choose you and that's really worth thinking about to man because you know it's really hard to get interested in something you're not interested in even if you know there's a good reason for it you know you're studying for an exam you find the material boring you know anything will be more interesting than than the studying even though you know that that's what you need to do you can't voluntarily grab yourself by the scruff of the neck let's say and shake yourself and say sit down and concentrate your mind will just go everywhere but then if you're interested in something and even if it's something you shouldn't be interested in because that happens all the time then it's like you're a laser focus man you can pay attention forever you can work until you're exhausted you won't even notice it then you remember everything it's like okay if you can't control your interest what does and man I tell you you can think about that for a very long time so Jung talked about the spirit mercurius you know Mercury's the winged messenger of the gods and and here's how he conceptualized it psychologically he thought is what the ancient people who thought about mercury has the winged messenger of the gods were trying to state psychologically you know your your interest Flitz around it's like there's something that captures it and that moves your interest from place to place you know like if you walk into a bookstore you'll get interested in a particular book it's as if the book grips you is you don't know why you're interested in that you might but often you don't know why you're interested in that book and you know your interest is flitting around and so that's mercury the thing that makes your interests like flicker around is mercury the winged messenger of the gods and mercury is the messenger of the gods because it's the things behind the scenes psychologically that are manipulating your attention and for Jung those were equivalent in some sense to the lost gods and so for Jung your your interest was being manipulated behind the scenes by unseen forces that were associated with your character illogical development across time that was the manifestation of the self so the self is this the the potential you let's say and the way it operates in the present is by gripping your interest in directing it somewhere and that's part of the instinct of self-realization it's a mind-boggling idea man really it's I think it's correct I can't see how it can't be correct it doesn't mean I understand it completely but it certainly seems phenomenologically correct and I mean the potential that you are has to manifest itself somehow in in the here and now it has to and what better way than by directing your attention you know it's like it seems like this might be useful for you or maybe you get attracted to this person or maybe you admire this person that happens with kids a lot they'll admire someone and then copy them and you can see that that's obviously part of their developmental progression right it's a form of hero worship but kids are very imitative and they hero worship at the drop of a hat and so they're they're entranced by the the next stage of development and if they see someone who embodies that especially if it's in the zone of proximal development it's it's um it's something they could achieve stretching a bit they find someone who embodies that next stage of development and then they start to imitate them and act like them well we're adults are no different we're no different we're just we do it at a perhaps more abstract and sophisticated level so okay so Jacob and Esau are hostile brothers there they're like Cain and Abel except the mixture of Cain and Abel and they're very different Esau was red and covered with hair he was a hunter and a man of the field so he's like your basic jock right he's extroverted he's outgoing he's really tough he's like extraordinarily masculine he hunts and he's a real favorite of his father and so and and Jacob isn't he's a dweller in tents and yeah right exactly exactly exactly right and it says Isaac loved Esau but Rebekah loved Jacob now that's a problem right that that's a big problem and that there's a Freudian element to this it's like this family is now divided because one child is the favorite of the mother and that's Jacob and one child is the favorite of the father and so Jacob is kind of a mother's boy I guess to use an rather archaic phrase and certainly not as admirable from his father's perspective as Esau who's a tough guy who goes out with a bow and arrow and like you know wanders around in the plains and brings animals home and and he's tough he's a tough guy so and but but there's this discord in the family because one parent prefers one child and the other parent prefers the other and it's obvious from the story that the parents do not communicate about this because they really take sides and so there's a split in the family and that's I think very realistic because one of the things that you do learn if you have a family and of course most of you do but if you also think about families is that there's there's deep divisions within families very very frequently that no one will ever talk about and or even think about often because it's too painful to think about you know and Freud himself said Freud was clearly his mother's favorite and the family sacrificed a lot including some of the potential ambitions of the other children in order to kind of put Sigmund Freud up on a pedestal and and advance his education and it worked I mean you know he turned into a great man but there was a cost to his siblings and Freud himself said that there was something about being the favorite of the mother that gave a person additional confidence throughout their life and you know there's there's something to be said about that even someone like Eric Erickson you know he noted that very interested in child development that that first bonding with the mother was the it was the place where trust was established maybe trust even in the goodness of existence was established and so anyways Jacob is Rachel's favorite and he saw his Isaac's favorite now he saw being extroverted let's say is also a bit impulsive and maybe he's not he's a man of action he's not a forward thinker and but he's also doing hard work and so you know he goes out and he's hunting and he's worn out and he comes home and he's faint with hunger and Jacob is at home cooking he's boiling up lentils red lentils and you know Esau comes in from the hunt and he's like half starved to death and he's sitting there in the aroma of these red lentils reaches them and he's exhausted and and and he tells Jacob that he wants some of this stew and Jacob who's being a pain in the neck fundamentally they basically says no there's a there's a teasing thing going on here and and we won't give him any and and and there's you have to imagine this because it's not laid out explicitly in the story but there's some dispute about whether Esau gets to have lunch and Jacob finally says well I'll give you some but you have to you have to give me your birthright and he saw you think he must say something like you know well to hell with it take it you know you son of a take it just give me some damn stew it's something like that so that's what happens but you know with these archaic people once he made a statement like that that was you were done that was it and so Esau sells his birthright and this turns out to be incredibly significant Manson who wrote biblical commentary said oh there's a bit of a twist to it so Esau eats the the red lentils and then from then on his name is red and you've got to use your imagine in a bit I mean people are making fun of him right that's why they're calling him red I mean he's already red because we established that but no one was calling him red before this and so for the rest of his life you know every time he goes out amongst his friends and family they call him red and sort of snicker because he's the you know half famished idiot who sold his birthright for a bowl of lentils and so it's it's not it's not that funny actually and so Esau is not happy about this and and it actually turns out that this so what does it mean it means don't sell the future for the desires of the present and don't be casual about what you have and then there's an archetypal element to this too and Benson says various have been the opinions what this birthright was which Esau sold but the most probable is that together with the right of sacrificing so determining what should be sacrificed and when and being the priest of the family it included the peculiar blessing promised to the seed of Abraham that of being the progenitor of the Messiah and the error of the special promises of God respecting Christ's Kingdom it was at least typical of spiritual privileges those of the firstborn that are written in heaven well that's a lot harsher than meets the eye to begin with and so there's a very interesting deep moral story there which is it's sort of Esau does the opposite of a sacrifice it's the reverse right he sacrifices the future for the present and so the story basically says the way it's laid out across stories is that if you're the sort of person that sacrifices the future to the present then that eradicate the possibility that you will bring the the most noble being into existence that's what it means and you can again this is the psychological significance of the biblical story so that's a bad thing to do if you want to realize your potential let's say you don't do reverse sacrifices that's a very bad idea and so Esau really did himself in by being too attached to the present without a vision of the future so he's - in the moment you know and and he pays a heavy price for it I mean he's the first of all he loses his birthright and and his double inheritance so there's a practical consequence and then there's a spiritual consequence and then he's well he's been made a fool of by his brother Jacob means supplanter by the way that's what the name means and Jacob is always trying to usurp Esau as we see and so Jacob gets one over on him and you know that's not doesn't make an older brother happy when a younger brother gets something over on him that's for sure and then he loses the opportunity to be the progenitor of the Messiah which is like people already didn't realize that precisely but it seems to be you know it's kind of rough that so and then there's there's a statement in Matthew 16:26 for what is a man profited if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul or what shall a man give in exchange for a saw it's an echo of the same idea you know when you think well what is this idea of soul mean and it's not intellect it said it's something like it's something like consciousness allied with character I think and I think the reason that it's valued so much is that because you got to ask yourself well what do you really have when it comes down to it so life is suffering let's say and you know you can you can pile up worldly goods and the God in the Old Testament doesn't seem to have anything against that really right the people who he favors seem to prosper quite nicely in the world but they also have to make a choice between whether they're going to fundamentally sustain their character or whether they're going to prosper in the world when push comes to shove and the idea constantly is that really what you have in the world that allows you the best possible defense against the suffering that's intrinsic to being is your character that's what you have period and I don't think there is anything that's more psychologically true than that you know because everything else well first of all your relationships with others depend on your character and certainly this is part of the story of Noah's Ark you know because his generations were perfect so he had a very tight familial arrangement everyone trusted each other that's a big deal if you hit a rocky patch in your life right and it's character that it's character that determines that you know if you're generous and honor and all of those things and people know they can rely on you assuming they're not resentful that's a whole different story then they're gonna come to your aid when when it's necessary they're gonna pull together with you and you know when people are really after you for one reason or another and they're accusing you of all sorts of things and you're guilty because you you have a past it's laden with characterological errors then it's very easy for people to take you down because they'll poke until they hit a place where you're guilty and then you're done because you'll do yourself in with your own judgment and so well so ESO makes a very big mistake and there's a sacrificial idea here too which is you know now and then you're going to be faced with a situation where it's something you really want or your character maybe you'll have to lie about something you know and you'll think what difference does it make you know a lie about it Jacob does this but the problem there's a bunch of problems with that one is that well now you know that you're the sort of person that will in fact deceive yourself about the nature of reality if something shiny is dangled in front of you and that's not good because it undermines your faith in yourself and when you're really in trouble they call that the dark night of the soul when you're really in trouble that's what you've got you've got whether or not you can trust yourself and that's it you know when things are really harsh and so if you've betrayed yourself in that manner then you weaken yourself under the worst possible circumstances and that's just that's really not a good thing so this is very practical advice it's not casual moralizing there's very little casual moralizing in these stories in the next part of this story there's some parallels with Abraham and that's built into the narrative I think because Isaac is Abraham's descendants and so we have to keep the narrative echoing forward otherwise it loses its its continuity and there's a famine in the land that Isaac sin and God tells him to stay the course anyways repeating the promise he he gave to Abraham although Isaac goes to AB Emelec also telling the King and people that Rebecca was his sister exactly what Abraham did when he went to Egypt and so there's another echo there of the same the same it's as if the story is being told for a second time essentially and that's supposed to remind you of the of the previous story but they're careless the King sees that Rebekah and Isaac are intimate together and luckily he doesn't have them put to death he just tells everybody in the kingdom that they're to be left the hell alone and then Isaac prospers in that land just like Abraham did in Egypt until the Philistines asked him to leave he's just getting too rich and powerful things are going too well for him so he's asked to he's asked to leave now in the meantime Esau gets married Hannah this is a funny little story he says he marries two women who give grief to Isaac and Rebekah so they who every so marries they're not popular with his with their in-laws not in the least that actually becomes relevant a little later because they drive Rebekah quite mad so I get a kick out of that because that's very common you know it's not easy to integrate new people into your family and and hope that that will go smoothly it's actually one of the real catastrophes in life right you have a kid maybe you get along with them and maybe you don't but let's assume you do but then they marry someone that you just don't like and or maybe you think is wrong for them I mean that's really rough that's what are you gonna do about that you know because you're you're basically screwed both ways if you have the person you love around then you have to put up with this Prentis creature that they allied themselves with and if you if you get rid of them completely well then you know you don't have your child anymore so it's a very very difficult position and so that's another example of the realism I think of the stories now Isaac who's hypothetically on his deathbed asks Esau to hunt for venison because he likes venison and he's happy that his son is a hunter and Rebekah over here is this and so she conspires with Jacob to to slaughter two small goats and make his father some stew because he wants Esau to make him stew out of venison but Rebecca who's being I would say let's say slightly deceitful or probably lying that would be more accurate she conspires with Jacob so Jacob kills two little goats kids and boils up a stew and then he puts on some goat skins because Esau is a hairy character and and Rebecca dresses Isaac in Esau is clothing because Isaac can't see very well at this point and so then Jacob goes into his father with the stew and he's trying to disguise his voice but it doesn't work very well and so Isaac asks him to come close and Jacob puts out his arm with the goat skin on it and and Isaac smells him too and he smells like he's oh and which maybe wasn't the best thing but and feels like him and and so because Isaac thinks he's on his deathbed he decides to deliver a blessing - hypothetically - Esau and so but it's Jacob and so that's a big deal - because the blessing is actually as I said before with these ancient people it appeared as though once you said something you didn't get to take it back you couldn't say well look you've you deceived me so it doesn't count it was like they weren't maybe as as what week might be one way of thinking about it but another way is they weren't quite as attentive to context you know because if I make you a deal and then it turns out that you've betrayed me I may feel that the deal is no longer valid because the assumption was you were being honest to be giveth in that you know violates the whole spirit but that isn't how these people thought they said once he promised man you promised and that was that so Isaac blessed Jacob he says that God give you the dew of heaven and the fatness of the earth and plenty of corn and wine let let people serve you and nations bow down to you be lord over thy brethren that's gonna be rough on e so let thy mother's sons bow down to the cursed be everyone that curseth thee and blessed be he the blesseth thee and so there's a quite a remarkable painting of that so there's Rebekah she's looking pretty old and Isaac's looking pretty blind and Jacobs taking directions from his mother and we might say he's perhaps a little old to be taking moral lessons from his mother especially given how she's acting and so it's a pretty ugly scene altogether especially that we also know that Jacob already tricked Esau out of his birthright and so now he's like taking the birthright and he's taken the blessing and so as I said that Jacob he turns out to be the father of Israel it's like he's a reprehensible character these are major-league betrayals that he's engaging and it's not trivial he really really pulls the rug out from under his brother and you know you could say well Esau is not as awake as he might be you know he's kind of a wild man and fair enough but it certainly seems to me that the the predominant moral error falls on Jacobs shoulders it's very treacherous behavior what he's doing so then he saw shows up and he's got a nice stag for his dad and it's like little late for that and he states that his brother was rightly named Jacob which means supplanter because he's been deceived twice and Isaac says Isaac answered he's asking funny I was asking fundamentally if there's anything at all left over for him and Isaac can't give him the same blessing because that's already been given so he has to think of something else and Isaac says behold I've made him thy Lord and all his brothers I've given to him for servants which includes you and with corn and wine have I sustained him and what shall I now do unto thee my son and Esau said unto his father have you even one blessing for me my father and blessed me also and an e so lifted up his voice and wept and you know we already know that Esau is a pretty tough guy by all appearances and you know he's out there hunting on his own and camping and it's like he's no pushover and the fact that this reduces him to tears is an indication of the magnitude of the betrayal and Isaac says behold thy dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth and of the dew of heaven from above and by thy sword thou shalt live and thou shalt serve your brother and it shall come to pass when you will have the Dominion and you'll break the yoke his yoke off from thy neck and Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his father blessed him and Esau said in his heart the days of mourning for my father are at hand then I will slay my Jakub so fundamentally you know if Isaac dies or when he dies then we'll mourn for him and then Jacob better look the hell out because it's like it's it's serious death coming his way and you know he's got a he's got a point he's in in Dante's Inferno I think I mentioned this at one point so Dante's Inferno it's a very interesting story it's a descent into hell and it's it's actually one of the places that we sort of derive the popular conception of Hell was partly based on Dante's on Dante's imagination on his work and what Dante was trying to do was to discover the hierarchical structure of evil and you know you might think there's a hierarchical structure of good some things are better than other things but there's also a hierarchical structure of evil some evils are greater than other evils and he put betrayal in the in the in the lowest part of health right so if you were betraying people you were right besides Satan himself and so and I think that's good that's very smart well Dante was a genius after all and I think the reason for that is that you see if someone trusts you they're laying their vulnerability open to you now they might just be naive let's say and that's we won't think about that because you're just a child if you're naive you can still be betrayed but if you're an adult and you trust it's often because you if you're an actual adult its you willingly open yourself up knowing that you could be hurt right because you're not naive anymore so you decide to trust and you see all open myself up and I know that I'm laying myself open to you if you choose to use that power and then that's a good thing to know you know if you've been hurt as a child or hurt as a naive person you might say well why should I ever trust again which is a really good question and the answer is the reason you trust again once you're an adult is because you're courageous you're courageous it's an act of courage to trust and the reason it's useful is because if you trust someone you open the door to reciprocity and negotiation and cooperation and you entice the best part of the person forward and so it's a it's a courageous act but then if you betray someone then what you've done is you've taken the best part them which is the part that will courageously trust you know with open eyes right and you've stuck a dagger in that and so you've purposefully damaged the best part of them and so that's why it's such a egregious fault and and it's often people don't recover from that sort of playing at you if you betray someone badly enough you can you can damage them like you can give them post-traumatic stress disorder if you really if you really put your mind to it and you know that's not just a psychological disorder if you have post-traumatic stress disorder it produces permanent neurological alterations that make you more neurotic more sensitive to negative emotion really for the rest of your life like you can you can recover from it to some degree but stress will tend to reinstate the PTSD so you you hurt someone and it's not merely cycled not not that psychological is merely but it's not merely psychological right it's it's fundamental physiological damage so anyways Jacobs smart enough to get out of there and which is also not really a testament to his integrity right I mean he's done these terrible things at the behest of his mother because he wants power and and he wants to get it without deserving it and then you know he finally goes too far and he hightailed it out of there to his to another family member to his mother's brother and so it's not exactly the world's most heroic story that's for sure and so now there's an interlude here and this is a really interesting interlude it's the story of Jacob's Ladder so he's off to visit Lebon or lab and who's his his mother's brother and on the way he he has asleep and he lighted upon a certain place and tarried there all night because the Sun was set and he took of the stones of that place and put them for his pillows which seems to indicate very bad planning on on his part and and lay down in that place to sleep and he dreamed and beheld a ladder set up on the earth and the top of it reached to heaven and beheld the angels of God ascending and descending on it and behold the Lord stood above it and said I am the Lord God of Abraham thy far and the guard of Isaac the land were on thou liest to thee I will give it and to thy seed and so this story of Jacob's Ladder has really possessed the imagination of the West and there's a reason for that it's because it's an archetypal story because the idea of a ladder that reaches to heaven is one of the oldest ideas of mankind so you find it widely distributed among the shamanic cultures for example and it's a hallmark of psychedelic experience that's another way of thinking about it which is a very peculiar thing so there's one representation of of the ladder you see god up at the top there peeking out from the clouds now you know that's sort of where we get the idea that God is in in heaven and then heavens up in the sky and and that's an easy story to make fun of because you know we've gone up to the moon and there's no God there and and but but this this is not a reasonable way of conceptualizing what these experiences are about these experiences what this is the opening up there that's more like an opening into an alternate dimension that's a better way of thinking about it's beyond like from from the judeo-christian perspective one of the things you have to understand is that God is beyond space and time he's not in the universe he's outside the universe in some manner and so the idea that that you have an experience of God and it's up isn't the OP is the best that the human imagination can do with what's essentially a form of extra dimensional experience or that's the best way to conceptualize it and these experiences aren't rare you know they they make the they make up the core of of the shamanic tradition and so there's an intrusion of the ancient shamanic tradition which is tens of thousands of years old into the biblical stories at this point now why Jacob had a essentially shamanic experience is very difficult to tell because we don't know what these old people were up to right and we don't know how much of the archaic tradition archaic religious tradition was still extant about at that point in time but we certainly do know that our ancient forebears were using psychedelic substances constantly like Amanita muscaria mushrooms for example which were widely used in India before they became extinct that's the theory anyways that seemed to be the basis of the chemical soma which much has been written about and so we here ever this as a dream that were as a vision and perhaps that's what it was but perhaps that wasn't what it was either and perhaps it was an experience that was induced by or by the same processes that shamanic people have always induced these experiences and so we're gonna go through this a little bit so anyways there's a there's a connection between heaven and earth that opens up that's that's that's the that's the vision and there's messengers moving up and down now one way you can conceptualize that is psychologically as we already discussed that you know there there are forces within you that are active and alive and you can think of them in some sense as messengers of the higher self and so you could think about this as an image of a psychological reality but and so we can stick with that but but here's some of the representations that have been made I really like the one on the right that's William Blake I like the helix idea and I don't think that that's that's fluke there are helixes and double helixes and all sorts of imaging imagery very ancient and very modern that are associated with both healing and with this kind of vision so and you see it in the Blake representation God is associated with well really with the Sun and with light and and you see that on the left as well that wherever God is is where light is and so that's a very interesting idea as far as I'm concerned as well there's some other representations one by Chanel so now there's this idea that there's a there's the possibility of opening up a line of communication between the human psyche and the transcendent divine and there's a there's a great image of Christ as Pam - they're so creator of the world that is one of the first mosaics if I remember correctly and I wish I knew remember where it was but I don't but it's a very interesting image I'm having a carving of it made at the moment by a friend of mine but you see Christ's face portrayed in a medieval manner and he's holding a book so it symbolizes the importance of the book you know as a means of transmitting wisdom and his face is very asymmetrical and that the eyes are different one side and the other and one half of the face represents the human part and the other side of the face represents the divine part and you know I also think about that psychologically because I do think that that's the right way to conceptualize human beings is that there's an aspect of us that's mortal and human and limited but there's an aspect of us that's transcendent and divine as well and it's latent in some sense but there are times when it manifests itself and this is not speculation right this is like the oldest experience of human beings now it's not necessarily an easy experience to have but it's reported everywhere and it can be reliably induced as we've discussed before by chemical means which and I don't know what that means exactly we've talked a little bit about psilocybin mushrooms for example and you could say that the mystical experiences that have been invoked in the newest experiments down it Johns Hopkins are arrangements or forms of psychosis you know because they have some similarity to psycho psychotic experiences although psychotic people were given LSD in the 60s and they always said that that was something different than what they were having and if you give psychotic people amphetamines you could make them worse so their bio chemically separate and we know that and but also the thing that's so interesting about the psilocybin experience is is that they reliably produce mystical experiences that the people rate as among the most important experiences of their life and among those who have the psychedelic experience positive things happen to them and so that kind of messes with the whole psychosis theory right because what are you gonna do you got a claim that you give someone a pill and they have a psychotic break and then they're healthier it's like no that isn't how psychotic breaks work you're not healthy or after having one you're like you're a broken egg and it's not easy to put you back together so and we know that people all over the world have discovered every manner of psychedelic substance that you could possibly while you imagine there's lots of hungry people wandering the earth for a long time and they eat every damn thing they could get their hands on and now and then something very peculiar happened as a consequence so so I'm gonna tell you a little bit about the shamanic tradition because it's associated with Jacob's Ladder so according to le a de murcia le odd it was a great historian of religion a comparative Jung's and and and they influenced each other quite substantially le otta believed that shamanism that used psychedelics was a degeneration from the original more pure shamanism but I think later scholarship has demonstrated that that's incorrect that that the shamanic ritual per se was a direct consequence of the use discovery of an and ritualistic use of psychedelic substances but anyways Eliana identified three pathways to shamanism and the shaman in it in a tribe was more educated than the typical person with a larger vocabulary and was the repository of the oral tradition and so learned all the stories that had been passed down word to mouth and people by the way are very very can very very accurately tell the same story across generations that's been quite well documented so and and people who can't read really can remember because what else are they going to do their memories are far greater than modern people's memories because we can forget everything because we can just look it up but they remembered things because they had no choice my father knew someone who was illiterate and and and and couldn't use numbers either when he grew up in Saskatchewan you know sixty years ago and he was a he had a sheep if I remember correctly and although he couldn't count he knew if one of his sheep was missing because he knew all the sheep and so he could tell just by looking if one of the sheep was missing but he couldn't count and so well so people who don't have our particular set of skills first of all they're not stupid and second they have other skills that we don't understand to fill in the gaps so le ah de identified spontaneous vocation so you were just you have this spirit of a shaman let's say so you're probably extremely high in openness let's say from a modern perspective hereditary transmission so you know your father was a shaman and your grandfather was a shaman and so forth and you got initiated into that process or a personal quest in Siberia this is from Ileana in Siberia the youth who is called to be a shaman attracts attention by his strange behavior for example he seeks solitude becomes absent-minded loves to roam in the woods or unfrequented places has visions and sings in his sleep you know if you put someone in a place that's deprived that's where you're you're deprived from a sensory perspective it normal people will hallucinate quite quickly so it seems what happens is that if you dampen down the sensory input then you start to become aware of the background processes of your mind it's something like that it's like the signal-to-noise ratio I got to get this right as the noise decreases some of the noise becomes signal the background noise become signal and you start to become aware of your own internal psychological process is it something like that he has visions and sings in his sleep in some instances this period of incubation is marked by quite serious symptoms among the accout young man sometimes has fits of fury and easily loses consciousness hides in the forest feeds on the bark of trees throws himself into water and fire and cuts themselves with knives we went to a part lash in northern northern Vancouver Island about a year ago and they had this one dance it was the croc Wakulla natives and they had this interesting dance that was the dance of the wild man and so the person who invited us was the wild man and he was dressed up and in tree branches and so forth and so he was the person who'd been in Bush too long and he came in as a cannibal and there there was genuine cannibalistic rights among these people not so long ago he came in as a cannibal and everybody had to wear this like cedar headdress because if you had a cedar headdress on then the cannibal wouldn't take a bite out of you and they actually took this rather seriously so you should have your cedar headdress on and so he's looking around the crowd and there's like 400 people in this place and he could really act - so he's doing this wild man dance and then all the women stood up and started to kind of dance in place and sing and they were taming him so that was really cool you know it was really interesting to see that because those people are about they've had an unbroken culture for about 13,000 years say that's how long they've been out there and it was very interesting to see that dramatization of the domestication of of man by women laid out in that dance in that way but it was also interesting in relationship to the shamanic tradition because he came in as a wild man right and he had to be re civilized in some sense and brought back down to earth so but by whatever method he may have been designated as shaman is recognized as such only after having received two methods of instruction the first is ecstatic dreams trances visions the other thing that this guy told me and I have no reason to doubt him he's also not a literate person and so has a great memory he does carving traditional carving and he's very good at it he carved a 53-foot totem pole that's now in front of the Museum of Art in downtown Montreal so if you ever go there you can go see it I won't be there forever but it's there right now and he was taught to carve by his grandparents and he said that he dreamed in you know you know what the Haida images look like so the Crocker walks are kind of like the high that same sort of imagery he told me that he dreamed in those images so when he dreams that's the form that the things he dreams about takes and he also said that he would talk to his grandparents in his dream so if he was working on a piece of wood and trying to figure out how to carve it and he ran into a particularly difficult problem he'd dream and his great he'd have a conversation with his grandparents and they'd help him figure to solve the problem and then he wake up and he could go Karva and the thing is he told me these things sort of matter-of-factly right like you don't you know what I mean it wasn't like he was telling me these weird things that happened to him although he was doing that to some degree he I asked him a lot of questions about what he carved and what it all meant and you know that was just part of his explanation of how he did it and he he carved me a couple of doors that I have in my house and one of them is quite interesting well the to make a panel and they're an underwater scene and under the water there's a bunch of you know mythical monsters some of them are killer whales and I think there's an octopus down there and carved in this particular style and he said that the other thing that happens to him when he dreams is he goes down to the bottom of the water where these mythical creatures are and he gets inspiration from them and so I thought that was extremely interesting too you know we we don't know what a mind that isn't hyper civilized let's say hyper literate like like our minds are cuz we're so bombarded by external stimuli we have no idea what the natural mind is like really and so it was quite interesting to to to listen to that and also to see the consequences cuz he's quite a great he's quite a great carver so the first is ecstatic dreams trances visions the second is traditional shamanic techniques names and functions of the spirits mythology and genealogy of the clan a secret language this twofold teaching imparted by the spirits and the old master shamans constitutes initiation well so you know modern people have a problem with that because we don't really get initiated but I would say that you know let's say that we reach out a quest of some sort you wouldn't be here I don't think if you weren't because why else would you be here and so you're on a quest of some sort to figure out to struggle with the meaning of life let's say and you don't want to do that alone because you only last like 70 years and good luck figuring it out on your on your own it's just not gonna happen it's too complicated and you'll be too isolated right if it's just you that's insanity that's no one can stand that and so you hope that other people have things to tell you and that your culture has something to tell you you know so you're on a quest maybe not with the same intensity as a shamanic initiate but you know let's give you some credit and then you're also trying to understand the wisdom of the past and that's the second part of this it's like okay well you're a human being and human beings have been telling stories for a long period of time trying to figure out what's going on trying to figure out how to orient themselves in the world and so you know partly what you're doing here is exactly what the shamanic initiatives in the second part of the process which is to expose yourself to the degree that you can - names and functions of the spirits mythology and genealogy of the clan and the secret language this twofold teaching imparted by the spirits and the old master shamans constitutes initiation so it's that's the rebirth right yeah that's that's what a nation is it's being born again and and that's a birth of the spirit rather than over the body it's something like that and so it's the rebirth of an integrated psyche that's one way of thinking about it and a psyche that's that's individual but also grounded in common humanity and the wisdom of common humanity and that makes you strong or at least it makes you stronger because there's a limit to your strength but God Only Knows to some degree what that limit is you know people can be unbelievably tough unbelievably tough and I think it's even the more admirable for human beings to be tough because we're so conscious of how we can be hurt and we're so conscious of what that hurt can lead to you know you can have your family taken away from you and you can be destroyed and the fact that you can be courageous in the face of that at all is something that is absolutely unbelievable right and people deserve a lot more credit I think then people give themselves because the fact that we can be honorable under conditions of life and death right of suffering that's that's a testament to the human spirit and there's a profound anti human ethos I think that pervades our culture you know that considers human beings cancers on the planet something like that you know and that there should be less of us it's the same spirit that motivated the guy who wrote the book about it better to have never been it's like I don't see it that way you know I mean I think people do pretty well for you know for having their leg caught in a bear trap and their head caught in a vise they're actually doing pretty well because life is really hard and the fact that we're not absolutely brutal and murderous all the time is really something remarkable given what we actually have to contend with that we can go out of our way to be honest and generous and altruistic and to care for each other under unbelievably dire circumstances and to act nobly sometimes under the most trying conditions you know in Solzhenitsyn's Gulag Archipelago he tells story after story of people who acted abysmally but also people who under the worst threats imaginable never sacrificed their character you know in reading about that is really well it really makes you wonder that's that's what it does the future shamans among the Tungus as they approach maturity go through a hysterical or a history would crisis but sometimes their vocation manifests itself at an earlier age the boy runs away into the mountains and remains there for a week or more feeding on animals which he tears to pieces with his teeth he returns to the village filthy blood-stained and it's only after 10 or more days that have passed that he begins to babble incoherent words the strange behavior of future shamans has not failed to attract the attention of scholars and from the middle of the past century several attempts have been made to explain the phenomena as a mental disorder but the problem was wrongly put from the one hand it is not true that shamans always are always have to be neuropathic in mentally deranged on the other hand and this is the critical issue those among them who had been ill become shamans precisely because they had succeeded in becoming cured so it was it's not the descent into this strange subterranean psychological state that constitutes the transformation that makes the shaman but it's the emergence back out of it and that's a journey to the underworld in a and a rebirth right and so and there's this great book this is a great book by a guy named Henry Ellen birch a and he was an existential psychoanalyst and philosopher and he wrote a book called the Discoverer of the unconscious which I would highly recommend it's on my list of recommended readings it is a great book if you want to know about the psychoanalytic tradition it's the best introduction there is and he discusses Adler and Jung and Freud and there's a very credible job of all three but also takes the history of psychoanalytic thought back three or four hundred years before Freud and so it's it's very engaging reading and and and and very interesting and one of the things alan burridge a points out quite clearly is and he associates this to some degree with this shamanic tradition that both Freud and Jung Jung in particular underwent very intense periods of psychological disturbance let's say and I would say what was happening is that because they were questioning their axioms at the most fundamental level they were deranging their cognitive and perceptual structures right and Jung was also experimenting with imaginative techniques with visionary techniques which he which he did a lot and there is a period of his life where he was having constant a constant stream of visions which he wrote down in a book called the red book but at the same time he was still functioning as a psychiatrist and operating normally in the world and so you know people have suggested that what he had was a psychotic break but that's ridiculous because you don't know that's not how it works man if you're having a psychotic break you you know I've been an effective psychiatrist those things do not go together especially not for a long period of time and so there there's the possibility of extreme experience without psycho psychopathology and so and Allen Burgess he says much the same thing about Freud and about Charles Darwin as well who underwent a terrible period of of mental confusion I would say as a consequence of formulating his theory of evolution which was really hard on him because he was a he was a die-hard Christian and he knew what he knew what the implications of his theory word he didn't know what to do about that you know so it was very very hard on him so it's quite common for people of genius to go through an intense crisis psychological crisis but then resolve it and the genius is in the resolution right the precondition for the genius is the dissolution in some sense because you have to be obsessed with the problem it has to grip you completely before you're going to concentrate it on it's so obsessively that you might come up with a solution but it's the people who come up with a solution that are the prophets in the shaman and so forth and so on and and and so that's not this isn't something that only characterizes archaic cultures we just don't recognize it in our own culture properly and and that's a problem well sometimes we do right you remember that in the Lion King right that Rafiki shows up he's the shaman he brings he brings Simba down that tunnel dark tunnel that's the dark night of the soul he has him reflect upon himself in a pool when he reflects upon himself deeply he sees the reflection of his father then that becomes a car thing of cosmic significance and his father appears in the sky just like God appears to jacob and basically tells them that it's time for him to grow the hell up and to return to the devastated kingdom and to set it right you know and so and that's right that's exactly right I mean we live in the devastated Kingdom that's an eternal truth and it's the responsibility of the individual to grow the hell up and to set it right because when it's devastated and when things are not in place then everyone suffers too much and that's not good and there's no excuse for not doing something about it because you don't have anything better to do so and even like children's movies tell you this so [Music] this is a fun one this is from the Eid wine Psalter 9th to 12th century and that's Adam and Eve but the there is speculation that the fruit that they're eating there you see it is psilocybin mushrooms right because they're the only kind of mushroom that grow like that so that's pretty wild you might say and then this is the I think it's called Bannister realign if I remember correctly and it's what ayahuasca is made out of and it has this double helix form which is very very interesting and they the people the natives nobody could figure out how the hell they made this ayahuasca we which transports people spiritually in a very intense manner and there's a whole religion based on it like a modern religion as well as the archaic religion and to make this stuff they had to take two plants that don't grow anywhere near each other and like there's like a million plants in the Amazon so like how do you figure that out nobody knows and then you have to cook them in this very particular way for a particular amount of time before you produce this stuff so one of the plants has DMT in it which is a very intense psychedelic but it's very short acting and the other has an MAO inhibitor so if you take the DMT and you take the MAO inhibitor then the DMT trip lasts for much longer and so that's what these Amazonian natives figured out and no one has any idea how they managed it and if you ask them they tell you that the plants told them how to do it which isn't much of an explanation as far as modern people are concerned but then when modern people take the ayahuasca and the plant so to speak starts to talk to them there are a little less leery of the whole theory that the plants had something to do with this so you know and these things that these I'm loathe to talk about this because I'm not an advocate for drug use but by the same token you can't ignore empirical data it's not reasonable and the empirical data that psychedelic substances can produce mystical experiences and that those often have a transformative effect I mean one of the latest studies showed that if you took people who are dying of cancer and you and you gave them psilocybin in a sufficient dose to produce a mystical experience that you radically it decreased their their fear of death it's like you go to think about that man that's that's tough that's a tough experiment you you just wouldn't expect that that you think you take someone you'd arranged them intensely and then when they come back they're not even though they're dying they're not nearly as afraid of dying you know you got to kind of wake up and smell the roses when you see something like that and the people who are doing this research are very reliable people so there's the Amanita muscaria you know there's this old idea it's quite a funny idea toadstools so flies like Amanita muscaria and there's some this is ridiculous there's some evidence that they actually like getting stoned so cuz animals will eat these like reindeer will eat these things too and they get pretty tripped out by them and so I have this book on psychedelic use among animals which is a small book but and so so there's there's this idea that toads used to sit around the they have any NamUs carry and wait for the stone flies to like buzz badly around them and then snap them up so that's pretty funny I think and so and you know there are mushrooms in in the u.s."

    "text": "that are the oldest the oldest organisms on the planet a there's one mushroom I can't remember where it is but it covers something like oh god I don't know like square hundreds of square miles it's like this huge thing because it's all underground right and they have these very complex networks of my Celia they're called and they think the thing is like a hundred and fifty thousand years old something like that so there's plenty of things about the world that we don't know that's for sure there's the chemical makeup of the classic psychedelics you see they all have the same fundamental structure this is serotonin that's the one of the major brain neurotransmitters and so what happens with the psychedelics is that they they alter the they alter the brain function by altering the neuro chemical utilization of serotonin they changed the manner in which the serotonergic systems worked and the serotonin system is very basic system because when you're an embryo and your brain is developing it's the serotonin projections that basically orchestrate the development of your brain so they're and they're very archaic circuits very very archaic circuits so and this is the paper I think I stole this from psilocybin Griffiths who's been doing a lot of this research psilocybin can occasion mystical type experiences having substantial and sustained personal meaning and spiritual significance so why that's a good question right like so so here's a question for you it is beyond dispute that human beings are capable of religious experience why why is that exactly and like you can associate it with psychosis but that doesn't work if the theory doesn't hold theory hold water it's not the same thing so why is it there exactly and it's not an easy thing to figure out like I've been trying to figure I'm always trying to figure out a biological explanation for everything right because if you want to find something to stand on you want to make sure that it can resist a challenge and so if I can find an explanation for something that's reductionistic and materialistic and biological then I'm going for that that's a tough one consciousness is a tough one the moral sense is a tough one they're not easy things to crack the Big Bang is a tough one so you know I mean a cynic might say that maybe sometimes when people are close to suicide they'll have a mystical experience you know and you maybe you say well it's a last-ditch attempt of your brain to delude you into thinking that your life has some significance you know and that's a plausible theory but I don't think it counts for the generality of the phenomena so so I don't buy it what happens in the shamanic experience is that the shaman has the experience of being reduced to a skeleton first so death a deaf experience very realistic death experience and then the next thing that happens is that he finds himself in a place where he's communing with his ancestor or the ancestral spirits and then after that there's the climbing of something like the ladder Jacob's Ladder se and an encounter with God for all intents and purposes and it's very widespread phenomena it's the World Tree and I've thought about this a lot trying to figure out what this what this represents according to a yeah coot informant that's in Siberia the spirits carry the future shaman to hell and shut him in a house for three years here he undergoes his initiation the spirits cut off his head which they set off to one side for the novice must watch his own dismemberment with his own eyes dissolution to the primary elements in some and hack his body to bits which are later distributed among the spirits of various sicknesses it's only on this condition that the future shaman will obtain the power of healing his bones are then covered with new flesh and in some case he is also given new blood so there's a death and resurrection experience that's associated with the shamanic ritual we're here in the presence of a very ancient religious idea which belongs to the hunter culture bone symbolizes the final route of animal life the mould from which the flesh continually rises it is from the bone that men and animals are reborn for a time they maintain themselves in an existence of the flesh then they die and their life is reduced to the essence concentrated in the skeleton from which they will be born again that's a good graphic representation of the experience that's an old painting by I think it's her own amis Bosch if I remember correctly and I really like that because it's it's reminiscent of the near-death experiences that you hear people describe and they're quite common as well and and I had that very weird experience once I don't think I've told you this story I was I was assessing someone who had gone through a car windshield and he was very depressed it had happened a long time before but he was very depressed and the insurance company was basically accusing him of malingering because he'd been depressed for so long and you know he'd sort of healed up and everything but if your left hemisphere is damaged especially the frontal part of your left hemisphere then you can be in a chronic state of depression because the left hemisphere generally speaking is responsible for positive emotion and so if it isn't there then it's like negative emotion for you and so I wouldn't assess him and I was giving him this I think it was called the MMPI the Minnesota multiphasic personality inventory which is a kind of a standard path personality test half psychopathology test and he was filling it out he was a very serious guy middle-aged guy nothing about him was new agey in the least he was like an accountant I think I think in fact he was an accountant if I remember correctly and there was one question and it said my spirit has left my I think that's right it's very close and he stopped and he asked me well he said I'm not sure how to answer this and so I said well why and he said well after I went through the car windshield I was in a coma for three weeks something like that and I died I think he said he died three times and he said that he could remember he couldn't remember anything during that period of time and he couldn't remember the car accident that's retrograde amnesia it's quite corn common with head injuries and he said that during one of those experiences and this is all he remembered from the hospital was that he came out of his body and went down the long tunnel of light you've heard these near-death experiences and then saw his family members there and saw the heavenly light and then realized that it wasn't his time and came back to his body now what was interesting about this guy was that well first of all I didn't ask him about this right he basically volunteered this story and it was instigated by this question and and he didn't know that anybody else at any ever had an experience like that cuz I asked him if he'd ever heard anything about like that he said no so that was interesting but what really was interesting is how the hell did he remember that right because he had amnesia during that entire period of time he was in a bloody coma so he didn't remember anything they remembered that and so well those experiences are more common than you think and then there's a you know there's a painting of one which is quite interesting and that's like a tunnel to heaven it's the same basic idea it's a little bit more suffering going on in this one I think but that's pretty much typical of Hieronymous Bosch I mean I don't know what was up with that guy but he was he was one strange character now the Scandinavians have this idea that the world is a tree and I've been thinking about that a lot I think that the tree idea tree is something that is grounded in in matter let's say and that reaches up to heaven in the Scandinavian tree at the bottom there's quite a cool idea at the bottom of that see this tree is constantly being gnawed by snakes you can sort of see the snakes at the bottom and at the same time it's being watered and the water makes the tree grow at the same rate that the snakes gnaw on its roots so it's like a yin-yang idea you know that there's continual chaotic destruction and replacement at the basis of whatever this process is but the tree seems to me to be a representation not so much of its it's like a different dimensional space that's that's what's trying to be represented so imagine that you know you're structured if you take powers of ten magnification say human beings are about in the middle of the tiniest thing and the largest thing if you do it by my powers of 10 and so you know you have a subatomic level in an atomic level a molecular level and you know then that may be a level of organs and then there's you and then there's your family and so on all the way up the the tree fundamentally and so I think that what this tree represents and this is the things that thing that the shaman moves up and down I think that's what it represents it's this it's this different view of of its dimensionality it's something like that and I think that what happens in the psychedelic experience is that consciousness can travel up and down that structure it's something like that and maybe not only up and down it but maybe right through it and I know that's a radical claim it's a really radical claim and it might be wrong but it's probably wrong even because most radical claims are wrong but but but I'm not so sure it's wrong and here's something cool so that's the Scandinavian world tree and that was drawn by an anthropologist who visited the tribes in the Amazon who use ayahuasca now you see it's a snake it's a tree with snakes well you know that's reminiscent of the story in Adam and Eve obviously but it's also reminiscent of our primate dwelling place right because that was basically our ancestral home a tree surrounded by snakes and the snakes like to eat us and this is a long time ago this is like 50 million years ago it's really a long time ago and so we don't know where these images come from precisely but I do have the suspicion that we use the circuitry that we developed to detect snakes to represent the unknown as such because like a snake is something that comes out of the unknown and like we evolved right we all evolved out of an animal sub structure and so we had to get our our biological cognitive structure from somewhere and we have this capacity of thinking about the absolute unknown and the terrors that are involved in that that the horrors that can emerge from what we don't understand and it stands perfectly to reason that we would use circuits that were already pre developed for that and that this is a reasonable representation of the existential structure of the world so I think I might have showed you this before but it never ceases to amaze me this this picture so my son drew this when he was nine eight and so on the right you see mushroom houses and they have the names of all his friends on them and so that's order right and then on the left side you see chaos there and that little orange thing is a bug and then there's a river that runs right down the middle and so that's like the you know the yin-yang symbol with the divide in the middle that's quite cool and then there's there it is there's Jacob's Ladder it's like Jack and the Beanstalk which is by the way another variant of the same shamanic story and there are bugs going up and down it they're taking messages from heaven and then up there in heaven it's got the Sun and there's st."

    "text": "Peter and I don't know where in the world he got this it's not like he had a lot of religious education I mean despite me and you know there's the pearly gates up there and then that was the world as far as his he had a very well ordered psyche I would say and and still does but when he drew that it just absolutely blew me away and so I had it laminated and it's in my office because well I don't know because like what the hell do you make of that you know that's that's why so well you sort of get the picture there you know the cathedrals the great cathedrals of Europe are there like the forests in stone right and they try to represent the light coming through the leaves and so it's sort of our ancestral forest home but it's it's transformed into these great sculptures of stone and you know they produce all because of the combination of light and darkness and color but also I think for the same reason that huge trees produce awe and people you know and we don't want them cut down they seem sacred in some sense and perhaps they are but you know it also seemed to me this is an intuition that the the architects of these great cathedrals were trying to get they're trying to express something that's deep and structural they're trying time trying to express the idea that if being was constituted properly then it would be organized from the subatomic level all the way up to the highest cosmic level perfectly so every layer stacked on top of each other without any contradictions now that would be an ideal mode of being and everything would come together under those circumstances and that's what's being expressed in these cathedrals it's not all that's being expressed because they're also shaped like a cross and you know the idea is that the center of the cross which is the center of suffering is also the place of the individual the place where the transformation takes place that's all built into the architect as well and so then there's the tree like structures that make us up it stretched down to the tiniest realities the microcosm and there's this this idea it's all represented in the same way again it's this idea especially the Mandela up in the top-right it's the idea of is perfection of crystalline structure and that's what the Yogi's are trying to attain when they organize their bodies they're trying to get every single layer of their being aligned properly and it's something like and you can kind of see an echo of that in the I think that's a Tibetan sand painting if I remember correctly left the idea is that if you get yourself a line properly then information can flow along that tree that that's you without without impediment something like that and that would be like a state of optimal health and that both physical and spiritual exercises can put you in that state and that's well those are all clouds of ideas that surround this idea of a ladder to heaven so Jacob is talking to God and God says behold I am with thee and I will keep thee in all places where you go and bring you again into this land for I won't leave you until I have done that which I have spoken to you of and Jacob awakened out of his sleep and he said surely the Lord is in this place and I knew it not and he was afraid and said how dreadful is this place this is none other but the house of God and this is the gate of heaven when Jacob rose up early in the morning and took the stone that he had put for his pillows and set it up for a pillar and poured oil on top of it that's a sacrifice and he called the name of that place Bethel but the name of the city was called l-'izzat the first and Jacob vowed a vow saying if God will be with me and will keep me in this way that I go and will give me bread to eat and raiment to put on so that I come again to my father's house in peace then shall the Lord be my god and this stone which I have set for a pillar shall be God's house and of all of that that is given to me I will surely give the tenth unto thee and that's a pretty good place to stop so now I'll just conclude so you have this very morally ambivalent character right who's so far pretty much everything he's done that we're familiar with is not good so he's he's betrayed his brother horribly twice badly enough so that he his brother wants to kill him and everyone can kind of sympathize with his brother so and then he runs away essentially because his mother tells him to which is not exactly a testament to his character and despite that strangely enough he has this experience you know and that's heartening I guess and that's the point is that people are predisposed to terrible error there's no doubt about that and yet when I was writing my latest book I had a friend of mine Norman Doidge wrote the foreword and Norma's written a couple of great books and he's Jewish and he read some of what I'd written and he took me to task for making the god of the Old Testament you know from a Christian perspective too harsh and unforgiving and I rewrote a fair bit of it because of his criticism and because of what I've learned doing these lectures it's like it's not exactly right you know I mean what happens in the Old Testament is if you screw up especially if you know you do and you decide that you're not going to do anything about it so it's conscious and deliberate then like look the hell out you are in serious trouble and I actually think that's also psychologically accurate one of the things young pointed out and this always struck me was that if you don't know what you're doing this is actually in the Gospel of Thomas as well interestingly enough as one of the caustic Gospels Christ tells his followers something like if you make a mistake and you don't know what you're doing then you'll be forgiven for it but if you make a mistake knowing what you're doing and you do it anyways then like good luck to you and and and I think that's I think that's that's psychologically accurate I mean one of the things that's very interesting about the judgmental God in the Old Testament however is that he can be bargained with and even if you make mistakes especially if you're unconscious of them if you haven't learned yet let's say then you always have the opportunity to return to the proper path and that's people get cynical about that because there's no this mostly Christian idea that you could live a terribly sinful life but if you repented on your deathbed it's like heaven for you and it's like oh that's that sounds like a great deal right it's like you can do whatever the hell you want until just before you die of course you might not know when that is so that's a problem you then you can just say well I'm sorry and you know everything's forgiven but the problem with being cynical about that sort of thing is that it's no trivial matter to repent you know because to repent means a figure out what you actually did and the worst things that you did the more horrible it is to figure it out it's no joke right and there's no genuine repentance without understanding of the depth of your depravity and so if you lived a particularly reprehensible life and you come to understand it I think that in and of itself could kill you you know it's a terrible thing to wake up and see what you've done if what you've done is truly terrible so there's no easy out it's not an easy out it's it's just pure cynicism to associate that idea with with an easy oh it's not but there is that positive idea that it's continually represented is that the individual is the source of moral choice and the individual is prone to genuine error and temptation in a believable and realistic way but that that doesn't sever the relationship between the individual and the divine and the possibility of further growth and then I would say well thank God for that because without that like who would have a chance right who would have a chance and so the idea that the daddy has presented the infinite let's say as presented in the Old Testament is merely judgmental is definitely wrong and and is in fact something that you can contend with and Argan with oh I'll close with one thing one of the things that I learned that while I was going through this was the meaning of the name Israel because Jacob eventually gets named Israel and and I'm jumping ahead a little bit to the next lecture but Israel and so he's also the father of Israel and the father of the twelve sons who make up the twelve tribes of Israel but what Israel means is he who struggles with God and that's such an interesting idea because it's again a psychological idea and that's why I said earlier that it isn't obvious in the Old Testament what it means to believe in God because what Jacob does is struggle with God and I think that that's a really good characterization of an ethical life because if you're trying to lead an ethical life that's what you're doing is you're struggling like blind belief isn't helpful because you don't know what you're believing in like it's just not that helpful but if you're possessed by by the desire to orient yourself properly but also confused by the by the existential structure of the world which we all are then then what you're doing when you're trying to orient yourself properly in life is struggling ethically and Jacob actually gets quite hurt he wrestles with God literally and God dislocates his his his thigh and so you know the idea there is watch the hell out right the thing that you're contending with is powerful although you can contend with it that's the thing that's so interesting but you know you do it at some genuine peril which i think is exactly right but the idea that Israel so there's Israel the state let's say it Israel the promised land and all of that but there's this more important idea which is again a psychological idea which is the State of Israel which is the promised land is the state that everyone who wrestles with God exists in and that's not happy naive belief in you know an eternally blessed afterlife it's not that it's not a wish fulfillment it's it's it's to be actively engaged in life in the difficulties of life right and trying to find the path because that's what wrestling with God is is trying to find the path and that seems to me what belief means fundamentally in the Old Testament perhaps in the New Testament as well is that belief is expressed in trying to find the path and that's an ethical struggle and it's a real struggle it's the struggle of life so as long as you're willing to engage in that struggle then hypothetically you have the divine behind you and so I believe that I think that's true because the other thing I see is that the people who set things right so that yeah the the horrible forces of cosmic destruction don't do us in the people who are trying to set things right are the ones that are struggling ethically and so and that there is a redemptive element to that and I don't think there's any way of being cynical about that so well so thank you will [Applause] so remember to speak right into the mic because there are all these other people watching that will hear it will hear us so okay hi dr."

    "text": "Peterson so with the story of Jacob today there was a theme of betrayal and you can see that from the beginning because he was very angry and jealous at his brother I was thinking are there new stories or we can say about betrayal that does come from a loved one right where it's not from a place of so black and white of anger resentment and bitter and how do the parties kind of recover from that or is there any way to redeem that or is it as black and white as if you betray someone then there it's like Jacob where hatred no and in fact in this story it's not black and white because we know we're only halfway through it and one of the things I've noticed as a clinician let's say is that and as an observer of people in general is that I've never ever seen anyone get away with anything and Jacob doesn't get away with any of this and so you know he's humbled by his eventual experiences and he learns that he did it wrong and there's reconciliation that happens throughout the story of Jacob so and there's minor betrayals and major betrayals you know that some of them have tremendously serious consequences and some of them have lesser consequences but there is an underlying idea that things can still be set right even though it's well I think it takes Jacob some 20 years something like that to set things right and even then it's like touch and go so if I answer your question okay yeah hey you speak frequently in your lectures about I guess the war between good and evil or the struggle of life really is a struggle between good and evil being at the core of a conscious lived existence and I guess on that note if you were 100% certain that there was no afterlife would you still be able to preach that there's a positive meaning in life if you were a hundred percent certain some atheists seem to be 100 percent certain and yet they still preach that there's some positive meaning to life would you be one of those or would you turn into Cain you know so cynical I think that well as far as I'm concerned one of the things I learned from studying 20th century history is that like even if the idea that even if you take the most cynical of ideas let's say that life is irredeemable suffering and and perhaps isn't even justified because of that it still seems to me that you have an ethical duty let's say to live in a manner that reduces that to the degree part that that's possible and so and I think that that can be experienced as meaningful in some sense independently of the transcendent context now I don't exactly know how to strip off the transcendent context because one of the things I would say that's happened to me is because I've spent so much time looking at the horrible things that people have done is that it's like Jung said that he when this is one of his famous quotes he said no tree can reach up to heaven unless its roots reach down to hell and so as I've dug deeper into the depravity of human beings my sense of the possibility of human beings has also grown what would you say in proportion and until I've become convinced actually that good is a more powerful force than evil even though evil is an unbelievably powerful force and so I can't really strip the transcendent away now whether what bearing that has on eternity say on an afterlife i mean i i i I can't say anything about that the only thing I guess I can say is that there are many things about being that we don't understand in the least and we don't understand the nature of consciousness or the nature of time so I I'm not I wouldn't despair about that but yes I think that life can still be meaningful without without there being a necessity of an afterlife no no no no hi dr."

    "text": "Pederson so since studying your work one of the things that I found most fascinating is your analysis of the story of Cain and Abel and my question is if if Cain got to the point that he did right before killing his brother murdering his ideal and decided that that was something he didn't want to do what advice or guidance would you would you give a person that got to that point well there's a story I read called the cocktail party I've mentioned this before by TS Eliot and in the cocktail party there's a scene it's a play where this woman approaches a psychiatrist and and starts talking to him about her problems and she says something that surprises him she says I hope that I'm the problem he says well why would you hope that and she says well I thought about it a lot and if the world is the problem then I'm done because I can't change the world but if I'm the problem then maybe there's something about myself I can change and I can undo this terrible situation that I'm in and so I would say that's repentance fundamentally it's like there if and I say this carefully because I understand that people are susceptible to bad fortune sin and ignorance can make that worse but independently of that like good people suffer make no mistake about it but if things aren't right for you if you're resentful about being because that's the right way of because that's the deepest way of thinking about if you read the writings of the people who do the mass killings for example that's what you see over and over it's cain it's like they're angry beyond comprehension at the in tolerability of being and they're angry at God even if they don't say it exactly like that they come so close to saying it like that that it's there's no difference you know what God says to Cain is look to yourself first before you criticize being and that strikes me as right it's because to not do that is arrogant beyond belief that's satanic arrogance literally if something like that can be literal it's like don't make yourself the judge of being before you clean up your your room let's say and because the other thing to it this is something I learned in some part from Solzhenitsyn when he was in the prison camps and trying to understand how these heroic people he saw could possibly manage it one of the exercises he undertook and he really viewed this within a Christian Orthodox context of repentance and redemption is he said he went over his life with a fine-tooth comb and tried to imagine all of the ethical mistakes he made in his entire life that he knew were mistakes it was it was this was the soul searched not he wasn't relying on external standards of morality except insofar as we're inevitably influenced by those and then his idea was is there something I could do right now to put that right and that's the right question like if things aren't going your way and I think that means that you're resentful and arrogant and deceitful those are the three things that clump together I think that constitute the core of evil it's something like that and so if you're possessed by that which is a hell then its repentance that's the right answer and what that means is you have to figure out what you did wrong and you have to pay for it and then at least you could think well look I can try that with all of my soul let's say and see what happens right it can at least be an experiment and then I would also say that that's an act of faith it's an act of faith to conduct that experiment because you put yourself on the line right and that's what an active faith is you don't know the outcome but you don't know the outcome of your life so live in some sense is an act of faith you're putting faith in something that that's why you're moving forward you couldn't move forward without an act of faith you know and people say well I own move forward on the basis of the facts it's like yeah but you select the facts and there's an infinity of facts and they don't just tell you what to do so it's not a credible answer so if you're in that situation it's like look to yourself you know and one of the things about Solzhenitsyn that's so bloody amazing is that's what he did and then he wrote the Gulag Archipelago and you know he took an axe to the intellectual and moral substructure of of the totalitarian communist states so while he was redeeming himself let's say he was simultaneously redeeming the world and you know you see something like that like you you gotta wake up man that's that was really something so yeah dr."

    "text": "Peterson I have a lot of questions that arise from your comments at the Bell for one hundred event your m103 video your recent discussion with ayaan Hirsi Ali and your comments on Islam in the West in general and in your comments there's this common theme that one of these things is not like the other you put the judeo-christian tradition on the one side and Islam on the other specifically the quote complex problem of Islam in the quote as a quote totalizing system and before I go further let me state that if hypothetically a final analysis of Islam resulted in as total of denunciation as your analysis of post-modernism or near Marxism I wouldn't be personally offended at all this isn't a a personal question in your recent interview with ayaan Hirsi Ali she said Western values are superior to Islamic law and Islamic values I agree with that basically certainly in the context of let's say current global affairs I'll skip the quotes from a recent magazine interview but you should read them because hers is a worldview which is very much the West versus Islam not radical Islam but Islam including necessarily the military option so my question is at the level of psychological significance of these stories at the level of mythology and archetype how is Islam so different from the Jo Christian tradition you know because Adam Adam Eve of Shaitaan Shaitaan so on and so forth everything from the fault of the flood a lot of what you've discussed in this lecture series is necessarily part of Islam as well and in fact I think one of the strongest criticism of Islam that it's perhaps pretty unoriginal you know tonight you said that the moral presuppositions of a culture are instantiated in its stories I see a lot of the same stories so current global affairs aside I'm asking at the deepest levels how different are these stories in the morals presuppositions ok well that's that's a killer question well ok so the first thing I would say is fundamentally I don't know and so part of the reason that I'm one of the things I'm planning to do is to have a series of discussions and plenty of people have contacted me about discussing with ayaan Hirsi Ali as you know she has powerful and serious folks and they're not happy with her black and white distinction and so now I read infidel and I really liked that book like I my sense was that she she was a heroine now what that means in relationship to Islam that's a different story because she came out of a like a totalitarian let's say family structure in a relatively totalitarian society and you could make the case that there's a correspondence between that and his lemon you could make the case that there isn't and and of course that's the critical issue and so there's a couple of things that I can't wrap my head around with we have wrap my head around easily in relationship to Islam and so one is what I see as the failure to separate church from state and that's a problem now it may not be a problem as such but it's certainly a problem in relationship to the relation between Islam and the West because we separate church from state now there's fundamentalists in the United States Christian fundamentalists who think that that separation is a mistake so it's not only it's not only an idea that's rooted in Islam that those should be United but it's definitely a problem with regards to our coexistence because that's a fundamentally different presumption okay so that's problem number one problem number two for me and again this may be a consequence of my ignorance which I'm trying to rectify Muhammad was a warlord and I I don't know what to do about that fact like one thing you can say about Christ hypothetically let's say I'm not talking about a historical reality necessarily although I'm not denying it either is that of all the things he was warlord was definitely not one of them and I don't know what to do about that and so I don't know how to reconcile that and I don't know how to reconcile like not only was Muhammad a warlord which I don't think is an unreasonable thing to proclaim the expansion that he initiated was unbelievably successful I mean within six hundred years it was the biggest empire of the world had ever seen and a demolished Byzantine Christianity which is something that Western people don't even know you know I've read thinkers who said that the West was so traumatized culturally let's say by the demolition of Byzantine Christianity that we can't even study it now and so I don't know if that's true but I don't know that it's not true either and the Buddhists were wiped out of Afghanistan and we saw that echoed in talibans destruction of those great Buddhist monuments and so so what I'm hoping is that there's a bridge there better be a bridge and that's why I want to have these discussions because I'd like to understand if there's a bridge and so lots of people have sent me people who I should talk to who who they think represent Islam far better than ayaan Hirsi Ali and perhaps they're correct and hopefully I'll get an opportunity to talk to them because I would like to know why I would like to know if what I think is wrong because if it's wrong it's important that I know it's wrong but at the moment I don't a I don't know it's wrong and B I don't see I'm not sure what it signifies so and I don't think anyone is sure right because we have this entangled entangling of the civilizations you know when there's other things too like I'm not very happy with the Saudi Arabs and the Wahabis I don't think they're our allies I don't see how any Western woman can possibly think that they're our allies and I'm not happy with the fact that the petrol dollars that we send them are transformed in substantial part into the kind of propaganda that's definitely a threat to the West and I'm not very happy with the fact that our politicians appear stupidly blind to that now that may again be a consequence of my ignorance it's certainly possible but those are the sorts of things that that I can't reconcile and so you know I've seen that I've also seen parallels between the ideas that I'm presenting here and other religious traditions Taoism and Buddhism Hinduism it's harder for me to bridge the gap with Islam and I'm not sure why that is I think it has something to do with the things that I just laid out now what I don't know about Islam would feel very many volumes many of which I have sitting on my shelves at home right now because I want to do the reading you know as I progress through this but good evening dr."

    "text": "Pearson thanks for continuing this series even as atheists appreciate the interaction and the the conversation I wanted to ask you something that is both emotional and analytical because oftentimes you're basically pegged as seeing things very analytically so you were talking earlier about you were talking about the the the juxtaposition between happiness and honor even though I don't think they're mutually exclusive personally but if there's a situation let's say where someone is truly in love with someone else and they love them for many years and decades they have a whole history together and then someone and then one of the people in this grouping start falling in love with someone else so it's not that there's less love for the original partner how analytically and emotionally do you take care of a situation like that when you feel that you want to stay honorable and be happy okay so the first thing I would say is the devil is always in the details right so one of the things that I'm not happy about with much modern moral theorizing is that it takes a story like that you know and then tries to extract out a general moral principle and often that's impossible because the particulars of the situation are very important but having said that all right so let me think about that for a minute I'm not sure that it's possible to be honorable in a situation like that because I think that you've acted out the violation already and having acted out the violation to confess it might be the right thing to do although perhaps not you know because if you it isn't obvious to me that if you betray someone then you get to have the right to tell them about it I know I know you're not yeah yeah I understand I understand my observation has been that if there's a tight relationship and if one party is betrayed by the other in that matter that it's almost always irreconcilable it breaks it and you know I've helped people try to struggle through that but on both sides of it the person who was betrayed and the person who did the betrayal I've seen people grow up and not do it again and this was in situations where their partner didn't know and in a couple of those situations it seemed to me that it might have even been a necessary learning experience for the person who did it you know it it helped them develop and that doesn't mean I'm justifying it but life is complicated but but I think that society works better all things considered when you make a promise and you stick to it and one of the things I learned from reading young which which I really liked was you know he believed that and he had his affairs too so you might think about it as somewhat hypocritical but but I think that people can make mistakes without having what they think necessarily be wrong you know he said that there are things in a marriage that you can't have unless you're all-in and I believe that I believe that and so if there's a back door open or though like to begin with or a back door opens then I think that there's something about the relationship that is lacking at least and I think you pay a big price for that so I mean it depends on whether you regard a marriage as a practical arrangement or a spiritual arrangement now really it's both you know and both are important but if it's a spiritual arrangement or a psychological arrangement above all then I do think that you don't get the transformation without being all-in and if you violate it then even if you can work it out with your partner there's something that you will never get as a consequence so [Applause] last question okay I hope I'll make this good thanks also for a continuing the lecture series I haven't listened to all of the lectures but it seems like you focus very much on the appeal of the bible-- of stories to the individual psychology you have any thoughts on the relative importance of crowd psychology to the appeal and staying power of the bible and also the the reason why the Bible or the biblical stories took precedence over other ideologies which could have taken its place okay well let's go to the second one first I think it's the same thing that happens when someone both creates and edits a great movie it's no one knows like imagine how many choices are there in a great movie let's say it's an animated movie because absolutely everything in an animated movie is constructed everything there's God only knows how many choices like maybe there's millions of choices you know and each choice is guided by some intuition of narrative suitability or beauty or there's some higher ideal motivating it right the desire to produce a masterpiece maybe that's it that was certainly the case with the Disney movies for example and so that that aspiration then then makes the decisions and so I would say well something like that guided the writing and the selection of the stories in in the biblical canon now could have there been other stories included well the Catholics and the Protestants don't have the same biblical tradition and neither do the Jews and the Christians and so it isn't exactly clear what to make of that you know I mean that's akin in some sense to the discussion we just had about Islam and Christianity in some sense I've left that aside that specific question except insofar as I've just answered because I'm trying to take what we have which I know is that their route of our culture and to figure out what it is that we have why it is that we have it well I've made some attempt to explain that in the manner that I just described but I don't have a final answer I could it have been different it could have been different at some levels but the same at others you know I mean one of the things it's the scholars of comparative religion who haven't been infected fatally with post-modernism have definitely realized so young for example in Le ah de people who are interested in grand narratives one of the things they pointed out quite clearly is that there's there's there's a set of common mythological themes across many cultures and I tried to outline that in maps of meaning and that worked out quite nicely for me at least as far as I was concerned because once I had the basic archetypal structure mapped out it opened up all sorts of stories to me from all sorts of different cultures and that's been unbelievably useful like the Mesopotamian story of it the Anu mulisch when I figured out what that meant as far as I was concerned like I've never forgotten that it just seared itself into my memory and the same with the Egyptian stories and you know some Buddhist writings that I've read in some the daodejing is also very powerful so I think that things can be different on one level and the same at another but that humanity kind of coalesce is on what's the same over a reasonable period of time because there isn't that many ways that human beings can live properly as individuals and as groups together and so there's this constant force that makes our ethical presuppositions converge and then that's automatically expressed in the stories it's something like that now it's an imperfect process and it's full of error so so just one announcement well two announcements the next lecture I believe is November 14th so I'll hopefully finish off the story of Jacob looks like it and then I'm also appearing on a panel with God's odd and or an Amity on November 11th and there's still quite a few tickets available for that so if you're interested you could go to my website and pick up those tickets huh it should be well hopefully it'll be interesting I think it will be and might be too interesting that's one possibility so we'll see but I'm gonna do two more of these this year and I hope I get through the story of Joseph and then I can start in the New Year with it with Exodus and that's a story that I know quite well and that the Exodus and Leviticus and what's the one after that yes thank you so I'm very much looking forward to that because that is one killer story that so and I've got some surprises for that as well so anyways thank you very much for coming and hopefully we'll see you November 14th"

    "text": "[Music] that's a hell of a welcome for someone who's gonna talk about the Bible so I thought I would get farther than through Genesis by by this point but I'm not unhappy about the pace either I've learned a tremendous amount and so hopefully what we'll do today is finish Genesis completely and then I think I'll try to start up with Exodus in May depending on what happens next year I have a busy travel schedule and but I would really like to do it I really like the Exodus story and I understand it very well a lot of the stories in Genesis especially after the first few stories say up to the Tower of Babel I had to do a tremendous amount of learning about which is really good but I do know the Exodus story so I'm really looking forward to that so so let's dive right into it and see how far we can get today so we'll review first so Joseph's father is Jacob and Jacob is the patriarch of Israel essentially that the father of the twelve tribes and we might remember that he had a very morally ambivalent pathway through life and it's one of the things that I think so interesting about the stories in the in the Old Testament is that these so called patriarchal figures are very realistic and it's something that I was also being struck by that accounts in the New Testament that way there's lots of things that Christ does that you'd think would have been edited out over time and sanitized but they're not and that the Old Testament is definitely not a book that's been sanitized and that's it quite interesting that that's the case so you sort of see people with all their flaws and I've been trying to also derive some general conclusions about them the moral of the story of the Genesis stories and because these stories are fundamentally moral and moral as far as I'm concerned has to do with action right because moral decisions are the decisions that you make when you're structuring action when you decide to do one thing or another generally you want to do things that are the best things that you can think of to do and hence good but sometimes you also want to do things that are they're worse things you can do you know because you're angry or resentful or bitter and so the moral decisions that you make that govern your actions are really the most important decisions that you make in your life and it's not that easy to figure out how to make moral decisions we don't have an unerring technology for that the same way as we do for say making decisions about empirical reality which in some ways seem a lot simpler partly because we can work collectively at it partly because we have a rigorous methodology for deciding what's true and what's not so one of the things that's really struck me like it's an overarching theme I would say that the emerges out of Genesis especially after the really ancient stories say especially after the stories of Cain and Abel and Noah and the Tower of Babel when you get to the accounts of the historically or historically real people one injunction seems to be get the hell out there and do something you know one of the major themes for all of the patriarchs that we've talked about Abraham say Jacob and Joseph is move out into the world regardless of the circumstances at hand now that's in in in the Old Testament stories that's basically portrayed as harkening to the voice of God something like that maybe you could think about his destiny or a psychological calling and the funny thing too is is that it's not that these people have an easy time of it when they heed that call so what's what's fascinating is that they often run into extreme difficulties right away and I think that's very interesting first of all because life is obviously full of extreme difficulties and second it's another example of the failure to sugarcoat things which is one of the things I think makes a mockery of anti religious theories that are even quite sophisticated say like Freud's because Freud thought of religion as a and it was a wish fulfillment essentially and and also Marx who thought about religion as the opiate of the masses it's if those were true it seems to me that there'd be a lot more wish and a lot less reality a lot less stark harsh reality you know in the first thing that Abraham encounters is a famine and then he has to hide his wife and then he he basically journeys into a tyranny so that's about as bad as it gets in some ways and those themes recur continually and no one ever lives where they're supposed to live they'll even live in Canaan and not the promised land and so it's a pretty rough it's a pretty rough series of stories but the fundamental idea is something like there's no time for sitting around there's time to go out into the world and engage and then there's there's hints about the proper and improper ways of engaging right so clearly the improper way to engage is I think most clearly delineated in the Cain and Abel story and with Cain exemplifying the inappropriate way to engage with the world and that's to engage with the world in a bitter jealous and resentful manner now one of the things that I really like about the Cain and Abel story and that theme recurs continually with the with the duality of the brothers right there's there's constant conflict between a perspective that's essentially like Cain's and and the and the opposite perspective which all which I'll get to in a minute but Caine sees that the world is a very tragic place and that the rewards are distributed unfairly and that there are people who do better and people who do worse and as a consequence of that he becomes bitter and resentful and curses God and then he becomes homicidal fratricidal which is even worse than he destroys his own ideal then his descendants basically become genocide or something like that so that seems to be the wrong way to go about things you know unless your goal is to make things worse like it's not like it has a limited number of things has nothing to object to he's got plenty to object to his situation actually is bad he's overshadowed terribly by his brother who everyone loves who does extraordinarily well and who's good at everything and the story is a bit of nivel inton for Keynes failure although a fair bit of its laid at his own feet but he's definitely failing and so you can understand why he would have this terrible attitude but the problem is all it does is make it worse so it doesn't seem to be one of the things I've also learned as a psychologist sort of pondering these sorts of things it's often a lot easier to identify what you shouldn't do than what you should do like it's I think evil is easier to identify than good I think good is trickier but evil stands out to some degree and then at least you can say if you're trying to get as far away from that as possible we could even say just for practical reasons so your life doesn't become hell and your family life doesn't become hell at least you could get as far away from that as possible even if you weren't able to conjure up what would constitute the good as a name you could at least avoid those sorts of pitfalls and I do also think that its pitfalls like that that really threaten our society right now you know that I see a tremendous rise in resentment fueling almost all of the political polarization that's taking place and seems unfortunate given that by and by large everyone on the planet is richer than they've ever been now that doesn't mean there's no disparity there's but there's always disparity anyways Jacob of course Jacob on see so and so the and Jacob ends up with with with Isaac's blessing and so that's that's a moral catastrophe and then he has to run because his brother wants to kill him and so that's the fratricidal motif again I like that too I think that's real really realistic you know one of the things that Freud noted constantly and this is where Freud really is a genius is that the most intense hatreds and also sometimes the most intense love is within families you know and in the Freudian world of psychopathology it's all it's all inside the family and in fact the pathology in the Freudian world is actually the fact that it's all inside the family because people who get tangled up in the Freudian familial nightmare which is roughly eatable in structure can only conceptualize the world in terms of their familial relationships they've been so damaged by the enmeshment and the trauma and the deceit and the betrayal and the blurred lines and all of that that they just can't expand past the family and go out in the world so the idea that brothers can be at each other's throats I think is that's a very powerful idea and it's not something that people like to think about so so Jacob has to leave and it's not surprising because I mean what he did was pretty reprehensible he betrayed his brother but nonetheless he's the person who dreams of the ladder that unites heaven and earth and that's a very perverse thing you know what but one of the things I think it does is give in some sense it gives hope to everyone because it isn't you know if only the good guys win we're really in trouble right because it's not that easy to be a good guy it's it's it's really not that easy and most people are pretty keenly aware of all the ways that they fall short even of their own ideals and so if there was no hope except for the good guys almost all of us would be lost and so that's one of the things I really liked and was more surprised about with the Old Testament stories is that these people are a very complex and they make very major moral errors by anyone's standard and yet if and yet the overall message is still hopeful and the the message that runs contrary to the message of evil say that message of good is something like well there's a lot of emphasis on faith right and the that's a tough one because cynics people who are cynical about religious structures like to think of faith as the willingness to demolish your intellect in the service of superstition and well there's there's something to be said for that perspective but not a lot because the reality is much more sophisticated part of the faith that's that that is being insisted upon in the old testament is something like and I'm speaking psychologically here again that it's useful to pause it a high high good and to aim at it so and I really think that's practically useful to the research we've done with the Future authoring program for example indicates pretty clearly that if you get people to conceptualize an ideal and a balanced ideal you know so what do you want for your family what do you want for your career what do you want for your education what do you want for your character development how are you going to use your time outside of work how are you going to structure your use of drugs and alcohol in places where you might get impulsive how can you avoid falling into a horrible pit if you really think that through and you come up with an integrated ideal and you you put it above you as something to reach for then you're more committed to the world in a positive way and you're less tormented by anxiety and uncertainty and so and that makes sense right because here you are alive and everything and so unless you were capable if you're not capable of manifesting some positive relationship with the fact of your being then how could that be anything other than hellish because you it would just be anxiety provoking and terrible because you're vulnerable and there'd be nothing useful or worthwhile to do well that's just not I just can't see that as a winning strategy for anyone you can make a rational case for adopting that strategy in that you know you can say well there's no evidence for for a transcendent morality or for an ultimate meaning there's no hard empirical evidence but it seems to me that there's existential evidence as well that has to be taken into account and of course psych psychologists have talked about this a lot Carl Rogers for example in Hume for that matter Freud for that matter most of the great psychologists have pointed out that you know you can derive reasonable information that's that's solid from your own experience especially if you also talk to other people and you can kind of see in your own life when you're on a productive path that sort of in Nobles and enlightens you or a destructive path and I think it's kind of useful to think that maybe the dichotomy between those two paths might be real you know and and because that also allows you to give credence to your intuitions about that sort of thing but I don't anyways I don't think it's unreasonable to posit that since you're alive adopting the highest possible regard for the fact that you're alive and that you're surrounded by other creatures that are alive I just can't see how that can possibly be construed as a losing strategy and so that's the first thing so that's something like faith right it's faith it's not it's not only faith in your being but it's faith in being as such and the faith would be something like if you could orient your being properly then maybe that would orient you with being as such and you never know like I mean it might be true there's no reason to assume that it wouldn't be true I mean even if you just take a strict biological perspective on this and think about us as the product of three and a half billion years of evolution I mean we have struggled over all those billions of years to be alive and to match ourselves with reality and so because one of the things I've often wondered is you know life is definitely difficult there's no doubt about that and that's unfair and there's inequality and all of those things and people are subject to all sorts of terrible things but I also wonder if you weren't actively striving to make things worse just how much better could they be you know because people are very they like houses that are divided amongst themselves they're pointing in six different directions at the same time they're working at cross-purposes to themselves because of bitterness or began and resentment and on what unprocessed memories and childhood hatreds and unexamined assumptions all sorts of things and you you just gotta wonder if you could push that aside and or int yourself properly and then the other thing that of course is stressed very heavily in the Old Testament and of course that goes through the entire biblical corpus is that it's not only enough to establish a positive relationship with being which I think is the essential it's a good description of faith you have to make that decision right because being is very ambivalent and you can make the case that maybe it's something that should have never happened but that doesn't seem to be productive to me and faith seems to be I'm going to act as if being is ultimately justifiable and that if I partake in it properly I will improve it rather than making it worse so I think that's the statement of faith and then what seems to go along with that is something like truth in conception and action you know even people like Jacob who are pretty damn morally ambivalent to begin with get hammered a lot by what they go through and what seems to happen is that they're hammered into some sort of ethical shape right so by the mid point of their life's journey there are people who are solidly planted who you can trust and who don't betray being or themselves or their fellow man and so it's an interesting I mean it seems reasonable to me to first assume that you have to establish a relationship with something that's transcendent it might even be just the future version of you but and then second that you have to align yourself with reality in a truthful manner and that that's your best bet and the biblical stories are actually quite realistic about that too because they don't really say that if you do that you're going to be instantly transported to the promised land like even Moses as we'll find out in the Exodus stories he never makes it to the Promised Land and so it's not like you're offered instantaneous final Redemption if you move out forthrightly into the world establish a faithful relationship with being an attempt to conduct yourself with integrity but it's your best bet and it might be good enough and even if it's not good enough it's really preferable to the alternative which seems to be something closely akin to hell both personal and social so Joseph's father is Jacob later Israel he who wrestles with God and we've talked about that a little bit it's sort of implicit and what I've been saying is that I think we all do that to some degree we wrestle with reality itself that's for sure not only the reality we understand but the reality we don't understand which is sort of a transcendent reality and then maybe whatever reality is outside of that you know because the classic judeo-christian conception of God is that there's time and space and of course there's lots of things about what exists in time and space that we're completely ignorant of and that's transcendent in that sense but then there's an idea that there's a realm outside of that which is a well it's an interesting idea it's a very sophisticated idea I think rather than a simple idea it's it's difficult to know what to make of it but it doesn't really matter because I think regardless of what your attitude is towards those sorts of things intellectually you still end up in the same position as Jacob for all intents and purposes practically speaking because I don't think that there's anyone who at some point in their life or perhaps even everyday doesn't at some level wrestle with God and you could just call it well the nature of reality I suppose if you want to be say reductionistic about it but I don't think it makes any difference it's still something you're stuck with and it's not only the nature of reality itself that you have to struggle with but it's also the nature of your moral relationship to it your behavioral relationship to it so that's how you should perceive it and how you should conduct yourself and then whether or not the the advantages of doing it properly are worth the difficulty and the disadvantages so that seems to me just a straight existential statement then you know Jacob gets damaged by his wrestling which is also very realistic so anyways he also ends up his father of Joseph who's the favorite son son who's born in his old age to his favorite wife and that's who we're gonna talk about to you today so you remember so Jacob is the forefather of the twelve tribes of Israel and there's his his wives and this son and the offspring that resulted those are all the sons there's a daughter named Dinah as well and rachel is the woman he really loved and the first son he had with Rachel was Joseph and that was when he was older and so that's in some sense why Joseph is his favorite so this is the beginning of the story of Joseph now Israel Jacob loved Joseph more than all his children because he was the son of his old age and he made him a coat of many colors and there's a lot packed into those two sentences you know the first is that now Israel loved Joseph more than all his other children that's probably not so good one of the things we've seen in the stories that have preceded this is that whenever there's marked preference on the part of parents for one child over the other and in with with with with Jacob and Esau it was Rachel was Jacob was Rachel's favorite and ISA was Isaac's fav that didn't work out so well that put a real twist in the entire structure of the family and so there's a warning there right off the bat you might say well you can't help having a preference for one child or for another but I don't know if that's true and it's certainly something that you should be very cautious about because it doesn't seem to work out very well because he was the son of his old age fair enough and he made him a coat of many colors that's a very interesting image that coat of many colors that that idea and so I'm gonna delve into that idea because it sets the stage like it says what sort of person Joseph is he's favored he's younger he's favored but he also has this particular garment that characterizes him you know and one of the things I've really learned from analyzing women's dreams in particular is that women very frequently in my experience very frequently dream of clothing as a role and so if you're interpreting women's dreams then if they put on the shoes of their grandmother for example then you understand very rapidly that the dream is trying to make an association between their own behavior and something that's characteristic of either the state of being a grandmother or the particular grandmother and it makes sense right because clothing protects but it also signifies a role and it's interesting in in the Old Testament stories often if someone is going to act deceitfully they change their they change their outfit and that's kind of what you do when you act deceitfully right you dress up like someone else you present yourself like someone else so anyways back to the coat of many colors well for something to be many colored it sort of spans the entire gamut of possibility and so there's a hint there that if you want to be a full-fledged person that you have to manifest a very large number of traits and so I want to go into that idea a bit the first thing I want to talk about is some of the things that we've learned about what happens to you when you go to a new environment now there's this idea in very deep idea in clinical psychology a fundamental idea which is that if someone's a just about something what you do is you and it's getting in their way you take what they're anxious about and you define it because that already delimits it right because one of the problems with being anxious about something is you won't speak of it it's like Voldemort and then if you don't speak of it you it's way bigger than it should be as soon as you start talking about it you cut it down to size and so and it it's for a bunch of reasons it's because you're not as afraid you're not as afraid of as many things as you think and you're braver than you know and more and more capable so as soon as you're brave enough to start talking about what you're afraid of then you see that there's more to you than you thought and that there's less to the problem than you thought and then you can decompose it further into smaller problems and then you can figure out how to approach those smaller problems and so and then it doesn't seem to me to be that you get less frightened it seems to be that you get more courageous which is way better than being less frightened because there's lots of things to be frightened about so if you're courageous that that really does the trick now the question is what happens if you like let's say that you're very socially inept and you don't know how to introduce yourself or to make any establish the initial parts of a relationship with anyone and so then you start putting yourself in situations where you're required to do that and so then the question is how is it technically that you transform you say well you learn well we want to be more specific about that what does it mean that you learned well if you're dealing with someone who's particularly socially inept and you're doing psychotherapy with them you might teach them how to shake someone's hand properly and say their name and remember the other person's name and so you just practice that with them so that they have the motoric routine down so that form of knowledge is built right into your body it's like look at the person put out your hand shake it don't not like a dead halibut but you know with a reasonable grip say your name don't mumble it look look at them so that they can hear you and then when they say their name try to remember it and that's then so you can practice that with people and so then they develop something that's motoric right it's embedded right in their body and so and then you can say to them well the other thing you can do is when you start a conversation is don't sit there thinking about what you're gonna say next because then you won't be paying attention to the person and you'll make a fool out of yourself because you'll manifest non sequiturs right because you'll get out it's like if you're dancing and all you're paying attention to is where your feet are and you're gonna step on the other person all the time so you want to pay attention to the other person and then whatever automatized social knowledge you have will come to the forefront so it's a good thing to know if you're socially anxious right if you're socially anxious one of the things you should do is pay way more attention to the person you're talking to rather than less and you should pay as little attention as possible to yourself so if you feel yourself falling in because you're anxious then what you do is you push your attention out and pay attention to the person because to the degree that you've been socialized then all your automatic responses will kick in so but anyway so you go out into the social world and you learn to shake someone's hand and you learn how to listen to them and ask them questions because that's the next thing because people love you can't just ask them random questions obviously but if they start talking to you and you don't understand something about what they're saying or maybe something they said is interesting and you ask them a question they're pretty damn happy about that because it means you're actually paying attention to them and people actually love to be paid attention to because it hardly ever happens so they really really like it and so okay so so what's happening well first of all your mastering them automated motor movements right where to point your eyes where to put your hands how to move your lips like really embodied knowledge it's a special kind of memory and you're practicing them so that's building new skills for you and then by listening to the person and watching yourself interact you're also generating new new abstract information that enables you to conceptualize the world in a different way so if you go out to ten you go out and talk to ten different people or 50 different people then you get to listen to what those 50 people said you get to watch how they're how they express themselves and you gather a corpus of knowledge that changes the way you perceive that broadens you as a social agent okay so that's two forms of knowledge but then there's a third one which is real interesting which is that you know you have a lot of biological potential and it's hard to know what potential is but part of it is that you're capable of generating proteins that you haven't been generating so you should get right on that by the way so but what the way that works in part is that if you put yourself in a radically new situation then your brain that there are genetic switches that turn on because of the demands of the new situation that code for new proteins so it's as if you have latent software that would be one way of thinking about that will only be turned on if you go into the situation where that's necessary and so then you might think well if that's the case how much of you could be turned on if you went a whole bunch of different places and that's a really really that's a profound question because one of the deep answers to how you should get your life together is you should go a very large number of places and turn yourself on and I want to walk through that a little bit because there's a very rich symbolic world that expresses that so now the idea about having a coat of many colors would be that the person who is the appropriate leader because remember or the proper person which would be the same thing one of the things that these old stories are trying to express and to figure out is how is it that you should act which is the same as what constitutes the ideal those are the same question and the hand here with Joseph is well you should wear a coat of many colors which means that you should be able to go have a drink in the pub with the guys who are you know drywalling your your house and you should be able to have a sophisticated conversation with someone who's more educated in an abstract way and that maybe you should be equally comfortable in both situations right because you might think well there's more one of the indications that there's more to you is that you can be put more places and function properly and that would be a good thing to aim at because here's the other issue is that you know perfectly well that the fun the mental tragedies of life and your exposure to malevolence in the course of that life so those being the worst things there's not a lot you can do to to alter that fundamentally because their conditions of existence you're going to be subject to your vulnerability and you're going to be subject to malevolence that's that and you can't hide from it because it actually makes it worse so you're stuck with it so then the question is well what are your options and one option is to curse the structure of being for being malevolent and tragic and fair enough and now there is to make yourself so damn differentiated and dynamic and able that you're more than a match for that now that's not an easy thing but doesn't matter because like what what's the alternative there's no good alternative and that's also worth knowing so you see these ideas expressed in the strangest places and so we've talked a little bit I think in this video series about Pinocchio but if we haven't it doesn't matter you see there's Jiminy Cricket at the opening of the Pinocchio movie pointing to a star which is roughly the nativity star for all intents and purposes and it's a it's a symbolic indicator of something Dimond like and pure right glimmering in the darkness that's transcendent and above the horizon upon which to fix your eyes and so that's the thing is you need that technically and the reason you need that is because we know enough about psychology now to know that almost all of the positive emotion that you're going to experience in your life and positive emotion is analgesic by the way right it actually quells pain so it's not just positive it also gets rid of negative which is a big plus almost all the positive emotion that you're going to feel you're going to feel in relationship to a goal because you feel positive emotion as you approach a goal and so if you want to feel positive emotion then you need a goal and then you might think well if you want to maximize that positive emotion which is enthusiasm and also what pulls you out into the world as well as feeling good then you need the possible goal well not because that's gonna engage the largest segments of your being like if your goal is too narrow then a bunch of you isn't gonna be on board for it you know if the goal is well-developed and multifaceted then all of you can partake in that even your negative elements even your anger and and your fear can get on board with that let's say so you need a goal man that's worthy you've got us thank you good you need a goal that justifies the tragedy and malevolence of life that seems to be the bottom line now maybe you think well there's no goal that can do that it's like well there are still better and worse goals so and I'm not convinced that there are no goals that can do that I think that's an open question you'd never know that until you pursued the proper goal long enough to find out who you would be as a consequence of pursuing it so that's also your destiny or your existential voyage right it's also not something that anyone else can do for you someone can say get your act together for Christ's sake and get it get get at it that's that'll make the world unfold best for you but there's no way you can know that without doing it so and unless you think you've done a particularly stellar job of that then you have no reason to doubt its potential validity so plus like crickets are telling you this and so you know they're a very reliable source okay so you see the star the star recurs as a motif in Pinocchio and one of the more interesting elements of it here is that when Geppetto wants to transform his puppet the marionette who's being played by forces that operate behind the scenes which is a really good definition of the persona from a union perspective right and also something indicative of something like an ideological or conceptual possession Geppetto who's a good guy is positive father figure Reid lifts his even though he's a patriarchal figure right and a very competent one he still even lifts his eyes up to something that transcends his mode of being positive as it is and wishes that his creation would undertake the kind of transformation that would make it autonomous and fully functional as a moral agent no strings right so that's very interesting I think Solzhenitsyn said the salvation of mankind lies only in making everything the concern of all that's a pretty decent star-like goal I would say and so what happens in the Pinocchio story is that because and I think this is a symbolic representative of what I just described you that happens at a genetic level if you put yourself in new situations so Geppetto is roughly culture in the Pinocchio story right he's he's a craftsman he's he's a and and he makes Pinocchio so he's he's who's his son he's the socializing agent and he aims for something above mere socialization which is I think part of the mysterious element of human beings you know in our scientific models we basically have socialization and biology but there's always a third element in mythological stories which is whatever you might construe as the spontaneous action of consciousness that's associated with freewill and you know that's just basically being conceptualized in religious terms as something akin to the soul now we don't have a category for that scientifically because what we try to do scientifically is to reduce everything either to socialization or to biology but it isn't clear to me that that's it's perfectly reasonable from the perspective of practicality at a scientific level you don't want to multiply explanatory principles beyond necessity but there's many things that that doesn't come to terms with such as the fact that we all treat each other as autonomous beings with freewill and that that seems to work and that if we stop doing that then things go to hell very very rapidly so and the mere fact that we have been able to conceptualize what that conscious freewill might be metaphysically or physically doesn't mean it doesn't exist it just means that we don't understand it I mean what it was only in the last 15 years that we discovered that 95 percent of the universe was made out of some kind of matter that we can't even whose properties we can't even imagine except that it seems to have mass so anyways what happens is when Geppetto reach lifts his eyes up to the star he so it's society aligning itself with the proper goal with regards to individual development right so so the instead of society being at odds with the individual they line up and then what happens is nature comes onboard and that's the blue fairy in the in the Pinocchio story and that seems to me to be a symbolic representation of what happens biologically when when you set the goal properly get your culture behind you and move into the world it's that there's a biological transformation that occurs as a consequence of that which means that a bunch of you that hasn't been turned on turns on and I guess one question would be is what would you be like if you turned on everything inside of you that could be turned on well that's a good goal that's a good thing to find out so now I'm going to introduce a couple of other ideas so there's this idea in union psychology called the circumambulation and you only had this idea that you had a potential future self which would be in potential everything that you could be and that it manifests itself moment to moment in your present life by making you interested in things and the things that you're interested in are the things that would guide you along the path that would lead you to maximal development now it sounds of like a metaphysical idea or a or a mystical idea even but but it's not it's it's not it's a really profoundly biological idea the idea is something like well you're set up so that you're automatically interested in those things that was fully expand you as a well adapted creature well like there's nothing radical about that idea how else what else could possibly be the case unless there's something fundamentally flawed about you that is what the the situation would be it's kind of interesting to think about how that would be manifest moment to moment but the idea is something like well your interest is captured by those things that lead you down the path of development well that better be the case okay so that's fine and so there's some utility in pursuing those things that you're interested in that's the call to adventure let's say so and the call to adventure takes you all sorts of places now the problem with the call to adventure is like what the hell do you know you might be interested in things that are kind of warped and bent and often it's the case that when new parts of people manifest themselves and grip their interest say they do it very badly and shoddily and so you stumble around like an idiot when you try to do something new that's where the fool is the precursor to the savior from the from the symbolic perspectives because you have to be a fool before you can be a master and if you're not willing to be a fool then you can't be a master so so you're gonna it's it's an error mmm error ridden process and that's also laid out in the Old Testament stories because the first thing that happens to all these patriarchal figures when God kicks them out of their father's house when they're like 84 is that they they run into all sorts of trouble and some of its social and some of its natural and some of it's a consequence of their own moral inadequacy so they're fools and but but the thing that's so interesting is that despite the fact that they're fools they're still supposed to go on the adventure and that they're capable of learning enough as a consequence of moving forward on the adventure so that they straighten themselves out across time and so it's something like this so this circumambulation that young talked about was this continual will return to this this continual circling in some sense of who you could be you might notice for example that there are themes in your life you know when you go back across your experiences you see you kind of have your typical experience that sort of repeats itself and there might be variation on it like a musical theme but it's it's like you're circling yourself and getting closer to yourself as you move across time that's the circumambulation now you remember that for a second as well go back to it okay so imagine that something glimmers before you it's an interest that's dawning and you decide well first of all you're paralyzed you think well how do I know if I should pursue that it's probably a stupid idea and the proper response to that is you're right it probably is a stupid idea because almost all all ideas are stupid and so the probability that as you move forward on your adventure that you're gonna get it right the first time is zero it's just not gonna happen and so then you might think well maybe I'll just wait around until I get the right idea and which people do right so they're like 40 year old thirteen year olds which is not a good idea so they wait around until it's Waiting for Godot until they finally got it right but the problem is you're too stupid to know when you've got it right so waiting around isn't gonna help because even if it the perfect opportunity manifested itself to you in your incomplete form the probability that you would recognize it as the perfect opportunity is zero you might even think it's the worst possible idea that you've ever heard of anywhere highly likely highly likely so so you had there's niches nature called data will will - stupidity which I really liked so because he thought of stupidity as being it you know it's it's you have to take it into account fundamentally and work with it and so and so you can take these tentative steps on your pathway to destiny and you can assume that you're gonna do it badly and that's really useful because you don't have to beat yourself up it's pretty easy to do it badly but the thing is it's way better to do it badly than not to do it at all and that's the continual message that echoes through these historical stories in Genesis it's like these are flawed people they should have got the hell out of their house way before they did and they go out and they stumble around in tyranny and famine and self betrayal and and violence and but it's a hell of a lot better than just rotting away at home and that's the that's great so that's good and so why is that well okay so you you start your path and you think that you're heading you know towards your star and so you go in that direction and then because you're here the world looks a particular way but then when you move here the world looks different and you're different as a consequence of having made that voyage and so what that means is that now that thing that glimmers in front of you is going to have shifted location because you weren't very good at specifying it to begin with and now that you're a little sharper and more focused than you were it's it's going to reveal itself with more accuracy to you and so then you have to take you know it's almost like 180 degree reversal but it isn't because you know you've I mean you've gone this far and that's a long ways to get that far but that's a lot farther than you would be if you just stayed where you were waiting and so it doesn't matter that you overshoot continually because as you overshoot even if you don't learn what you should have done you're going to continually learn what you shouldn't keep doing and if you learn enough about what you shouldn't keep doing then that's tantamount at some point to learning at the same time what you should be doing so it's okay so it's like this now what's cool about it though I think is that as you progress the degree of overshooting starts to decline right and that we know that there's nothing hypothetical about that as you learn a new skill like even to play it play a song on the piano for example you over shoot madly you're making all sorts of mistakes to begin with and then the mistakes they disappear there's a great TED talk I think it was about this guy set up a really advanced computational recording system in his home and recorded every single utterance his young child made while learning to speak and then he put together the child's attempts to say certain phonemes and put them in the list and you can hear the child deviating madly to begin with and then after hundreds and hundreds of repetitions just zeroing right in on the exact phoneme so you know I you might not know this but when kids babble because they start babbling when they're quite young they babble every human phoneme including all sorts of phonemes that adults can't say and then they they die into their language so that after they learn say English then there's all sorts of phonemes they can no longer hear or pronounce but to begin with it's all there which is really quite interesting but so they zip as they learn a particular language they zero in on the proper way to pronounce that and their errors minimize and every time you learn something that's how it is and that's really useful to know too because it means that it's okay to wander around stupidly before you fix your destination now you see that echoed in exodus right because what happens is that the Egyptians or the Hebrews escaped a tyranny which is kind of whatever you do personally and psychologically when you escape from your previous set of stupidly held and ignorant and stubborn axioms it's like away from that tyranny it's like great I freed myself from that well then what well you think well now I'm on the way it's no you're not now you're in the desert where you wander around stupidly you know and worship the wrong things until you finally organize yourself morally again and head in the proper direction so that's worth knowing too because you think well I got rid of a lot of things baggage excess baggage that I didn't need in my life and now everything's okay it's like no it's not you've got rid of a whole set of scaffolds that were keeping you in place even though they were pathological now you have nothing and nothing actually turns out to be better than something pathological but you're still stuck with the problem of nothing and and that's well that's exactly why exodus is structured the way that it is it's that you escape from eternity its terrain we're no longer slaves yeah well now you're nihilistic and lost it's not necessarily an improvement but it is but it is the pre see it's also useful to know that because you can also be deluded into the idea that imagine that you're trying to become enlightened which might mean to turn all those parts of you on that could be turned on you think well that's just a linear pathway uphill you know it's just from one success to another it's no it's not it's like here you are and you're not doing too badly and the first step is a complete bloody catastrophe it's worse and then maybe you can pull yourself together and you hit a new plateau and then that crumbles and shakes and bang it's worse again and so because part of the reason that people don't become enlightened is because it's punctuated by intermittent deserts essentially by intermittent catastrophes and if you don't know that well then you're basically screwed because you go ahead on your movement forward and you collapse and you think well that didn't work I collapsed it's like no that's par for the course it's not indication that you failed it's just indication that it's really hard and that when you learn something you also unlearn something and the thing you unlearned is probably useful and unlearning it actually is painful you know let's say if you have to get out of a bad relationship it's like not every not any real there isn't any relationship that's a hundred percent bad and so when you jump out of it well maybe you're in better shape but you're still lonesome and disoriented and you don't know what your past was and you don't know what your present is and you don't know what your future is it's that's not that's why people stay with the devil they know instead of you know looking for the devil they don't know so so anyways the fact that you're full of faults doesn't mean you have to stop and thank God for that that's a really useful thing and the fact that you're full of faults doesn't mean that you can't learn and so you can pause it an ideal and you're gonna be wrong about it but it doesn't matter because what you're right about is positing the ideal moving towards it if the actual ideal isn't conceptualize perfectly well first surprise surprise cuz like what are you going to do that's perfect so it doesn't matter that it's imperfect imperfect it just matters that you do it and that you move forward so that's really that's really positive news as far as I'm concerned because you can actually do that right you can do it badly anyone can do that so that's that's useful okay so like if you were an efficient person you would have just done that but you're not but who cares you know you still end up in the in the same place and maybe the trip is even more interesting who knows probably two interesting young I began to understand that the goal of psychic development by which he means psychological development or spiritual development is the self there's no linear evolution there's only a circumambulation of the self a getting closer it's like it's like you're spiraling into something something like that and the thing that you're spiraling into recedes as you move towards it and gets more and more sophisticated and well developed as you move towards it because you're not gonna run out of goals right no matter how much you have your act together there's probably undoubtedly 30 dimensions along which you could get your act together a lot more so and some of those aren't even conceivable to you when you're in your initial on carved state let's say uniform development exists at most at the beginning later everything points towards the center this insight gave me stability and gradually my inner peace returned so this is fun on the left there that's the short Cathedral that's the one that has the maze in it that I told you about they actually light that up with lasers now and so that's it lit up with lasers and so so they're turning it into a Cathedral of light which i think is really fascinating and it's a it's a continuation of the same idea right because the stained glass windows were obviously I wouldn't call them primitive attempts to do that I mean stained glass windows are pretty impressive you know buddy it's an elaboration of the same thing so now you can go to that Cathedral they light up the whole town like that which is really something and so there and there's how the cathedral is built it's a cross and remember the cross is an X that marks the center of the world and the cross is the place where each individual is and I think that's the fundamental message of Christianity is the cross marks the place where every single individual is and it's a tragic place that consists of suffering and exposure to malevolence and that the only way to come to terms with it is to accept it and that seems to me I don't see anything metaphysical about that statement whatsoever it's like well x marks the spot fair enough you're in a spot you're right in the center of your world it's right in the center of the world as far as you're concerned and the same with the rest of us it's characterized by suffering and exposure to malevolence there's no doubt about that what are you gonna do about that bitter resentful hateful all that does is make it worse so you have to accept it now that's not an easy thing because that's actually I would say a heroic task to voluntarily accept the conditions of your own existence and that happens out the cross so that's fine and that's associated with light well that's good that that's associated with light you wouldn't want that to be associated with darkness that would be a bad thing so and so there's the there's the the labyrinth that was built in 1280 and so the idea is you walk in here it's the same idea as that star sequence of slides that I just showed you so here's the ideas that north south west and east so that's the whole world laid out in two dimensions and so the question is how do you get to the center now we already know what the center is the center is the center of the cross that's the place of maximal suffering you could say maximal malevolence as well but it's also the place where that's transcendent so how do you get there well the answer is well you don't just stand on the outside looking in that's not gonna help so and you can't just run right to the center even if you're in California and so you have to walk in here and then you see you go like this and you go to every single place every single place on that on that little cosmos and then once you've gone to every single place and expanded yourself as a consequence of going north and west and east and south then there's enough of you so that you're at so that you can tolerate being first of all that you could figure out where the center is but also that you can tolerate being at the center and so that's what that represents that's pretty and look I mean let's make no mistake about it hey people were pretty damn serious about those ideas like that's a that's quite the piece of work for people in the 12th century you know those some of those damn cathedrals took 300 years to build we don't build anything that takes 300 years people were putting a lot of effort into whatever these things meant you know and if you think they meant bearded man in the sky then you know it's hard to it's hard to account for the kind of motivation that would produce these buildings with that kind of paucity of conceptualization you know the towns and and it was certainly the case in charge is that they groaned under the tax burden that was required to produce these now you might think well that's partly tyrannical and no doubt that's the case but but that's not the whole story the whole story is that the people who produce those buildings they thought about every bit of it it's nothing's accidental and they're trying to portray something just like that window is trying to portray something that's the same thing as this it's the center from which all things manifest themselves you see it that's Christ there and being portrayed as as that center or the center within him something like that very much like the chakras and in in yogic practice same basic idea it's the opening up of the internal structure and and and its proper realization so there are people walking the labyrinth so that's the coat of many colors right that's that's this differentiated mode of being that enables you to be competent and at home in the widest possible number of places and that that's a real differentiation of your personality it's a breaking through the boundaries of your personality including the ones that you impose on yourself to become someone who's useful wherever they're put and that's really relevant to this story of Joseph - because one of the things that happens to Joseph is that well a lot of bad things happen to him because he's the favorite of his father his brothers hate him and so the first they're gonna throw him in a pit I think they do throw him in a pit then they sell them to be a slave then he ends up in we'll go through the story he ends up some places where you probably wouldn't want to go prison being one of them but it doesn't matter because even when they put him in prison he's actually not imprisoned he just figures out how to make the prison work way better and then he's in control of the prison and it really it's an interesting I had this friend you know and he was very smart but very cynical and he wasn't employed very well and he got a little older and he should have given his level of intelligence and employability and so he had to take jobs that weren't very intellectually challenging you know and one of the things I tried to convince him of was that even if he worked he wanted to work behind the parts department in an automotive store because he liked cars but it was beneath him you know because it was sort of a as far as he was concerned it was a he was too smart for a job like that which actually turned out not to be true he wasn't smart enough for a job like that or he wasn't wise enough but you know what one of the things I tried to tell him was then you're looking at the situation wrong because even in a simple job so-called simple job like let's say dishwashing in a restaurant which I did an awful lot of it's not that simple you're dealing with a lot of other people very fast staff changeover you're feeding people you're helping them have a celebration you're helping them take a break like you can do it really well and then the kitchen can operate properly and then people can come out to the restaurant it's not a bloody catastrophe and like your even when you're doing something that's a menial job so to speak like dishwashing there are ways of doing it really badly resentfully and horribly and doing it really well and as soon as you do it really well it's not a menial job anymore it immediately transforms no I mean you can be around people who won't let that happen and you should go get another job if that's the case but if you do it properly then it's not menial at all and that's also a good way out of resentment you think well I've just got this you know two-bit job it's like yeah what if you did it as well as you possibly could you know what would happen well the first thing that would happen is you'd get a lot smarter that's for sure and that that's hardly a negative thing okay so that's the coat of many colors so it's an intimation of what Joseph is like and what we're seeing with all of these patriarchal figures is the continual realization of the ideal person right you could think about it as successive approximations of the ideal person and the story is exploring all sorts of different possibilities including ones that are very violent and catastrophic and malevolent it's trying to cover the entire territory and to focus in on what's the proper way through the maze the maze of life the labyrinth and the hint here is that while you should be multi-dimensional these are the generations of Jacob Joseph being 17 years old was feeding the flock with his brethren and the lad was with his sons of Bilhah and with the sons of Zilpah his father's wives and Joseph brought unto his father their evil report well we already know that Joseph is Jacob's favorite so that doesn't make him very popular among his brothers he's younger and now we also find out that he's been set up more or less as you might say a snitch because that's what this phrase means is that he goes out and watches his older brothers and if they do something they shouldn't do then he comes trotting back to Jacob and reports well that's not gonna make you popular so and you would say well is that Joseph's problem or jacob's problem and I would say and this is something I learned from reading dealing to is that that's a conspiratorial problem right is it's the parents at fault but so is the child who agrees to do that they've they've got a little cabal going and you might say well it's only the parents fault but the son will be taking advantage of every advantage that offers him because he could say no to I won't do that so anyway so Joseph is the favorite he's a bit of a teacher's pet that's what it looks like now Israel loved Joseph more than all his colors because he was the son of his old age and he made him a coat of many colors and when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren they hated him and could not speak peaceably unto him so let's say you have a child or number of children and one of them is your favorite how should you treat that child well it isn't obvious that you do them any favors by overtly making them your favorite right I mean first of all maybe you don't challenge them as much as you should and second of all you definitely set up a Cain and Abel like scenario in the household and that or maybe it's an eatable situation too because you happen to love your child more than you love your your spouse which is that's not a recipe for familial harmony so it seems to be a bad idea okay so now we have two reasons that Joseph is not liked by his brothers is one is well he's a bit of a Rat Fink and the other is that he's the peas the favorite and he's playing that to the hilt by the looks of things and when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren then all his brethren they hated him and could not speak peaceably unto him okay and Joseph dreamed a dream and he told it to his brethren and they hated him the more he said unto them hear I pray you this dream which I have dreamed for behold we were binding wheat sheaves in the field and lo my sheaf arose and behold your sheaves stood round about and bowed to my sheaf and his and remember he's yeah the young one right and and also the daughter of the favorite wife which is another thing that's or the son of the favorite wife which is another thing not really working in his favor and his brethren said to him shalt thou indeed reign over us or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us and they hated them yet the more for his dreams and for his words well there there's a shock you know that makes perfect sense so and it gets worse so you see here well there's the wheat sheaves bowing there and and then you see this what's going on here well that's not the end of his let's call it grandiosity and there's an idea to in in the Old Testament especially in the stories of Joseph that if God sends you a dream twice he really means it and so I don't know if that's true although I do know that people have repeating dreams it might be true that the a dream you have twice is really trying to punch something home you know it's certainly the case that recurrent nightmares are meaningful and that recurrent nightmares are associated quite tightly with decreased states of mental health and that if you can treat the nightmare which is often quite easy by the way then the some of the mental health problems will decrease so repeated dreams seem to be important anyways he dreamed yet another dream and told it to his brethren and said behold I've had another dream and be and behold the Sun and the moon and the Eleven stars bowed to me and he told it to his father and to his brothers and his father rebuked him and said unto you unto Him what is this dream that thou has dreamed shall I in my and your mother and your brothers indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth and his brethren envied him but his father observed to saying well what the hell do you make of something like that right if someone tells you that it's like are they responsible for their dreams we don't really seem we don't really hold ourselves responsible for for the dreams we have at night and what do you make of a dream is like one of the things that Jung pointed out this is where he differed from Freud substantially as Freud tended to think that the dream hid its meaning because its contents weren't acceptable to the conscious mind and Jung said no no you don't understand that's not what happens what happens is the dream is doing the best it can to express something that the person doesn't yet really know and Jung thought about the dream as a manifestation of nature it wasn't associated with the ego at all it was just like you have a dream and there are things happening and it the same way that when you walk into a dinner party there are things happening there you know it's not the dream isn't something that's subject to your capacity for manipulation it's something that happens to you not something that you do and so so if someone has a dream like that well you've got three options you can just discount dreams altogether which is what people in the modern world tend to do which is a very bad idea because there are thoughts and you shouldn't discount them you know I mean and they're hardly random as some neuroscientists claim that's absolutely cockeyed theory that random he like television snow on a TV set if it was random so so one is while you just discount dreams the other is that you consider the person a liar and a braggart and a narcissist and the third is well what's the third it's like he dreamt that the Sun and the moon and the stars bowed down to him you might think about that two or three times so but it's not necessarily something that's going to make you happy and his brethren went to feed their father's flock and shechem so they took off and Israel said unto Joseph do you not thy brethren feed the flock and Shechem come and I will send thee unto Him and he said him and he said to him here here am I and when they saw him afar off even before he came near unto them they conspired against him to slay him rough people back then right this is this sort of thing is happening quite frequently and they said to one another behold the dreamer cometh come now therefore let us slay him cast him into some pit and we will say some evil beast hath devoured him and we shall see what becomes of his dreams so there's an echo of the Cain and Abel story there obviously you know I mean it's not quite as clear because in the Cain and Abel story Abel is clearly just doing well and here you can't quite get a handle on Joseph's character you can't tell if he is actually the elect or if he's just a spoiled brat with delusions of grandeur you know and but it doesn't matter because his brothers are so irritated at his the fact that he's favored and perhaps even the fact that he might be someone destined for for something special that they find it perfectly reasonable to destroy that and it's so hard so interesting how often that motif of pulling down an ideal manifests itself in these old stories right it's it's the pattern is established in the Cain and Abel story it just repeats and repeats and repeats and I think that's dead true I think it just repeats all the time so that people are annoyed about how tragic their lives are annoyed that they're subject to malevolence and they're annoyed that they're not doing as well as other people are doing and that makes them that puts them exactly into this state of mind now maybe with modern people if you're gonna kill someone because you're resentful as a modern person you don't generally slay them and throw them into a pit you know what you do is you just kill them slowly over a few decades and it isn't obvious to me that that's any better so I've seen plenty of married couples who were in that situation it's like it's like yeah well there is this mitch hedberg he used to complain about turtlenecks hey so it was like being strangled by a really weak it's probably really politically incorrect jokes but it's a funny joke so and then you see you see relationships that are like that it's like each person has their hands around the neck of the other person but they don't have enough courage to actually to squeeze they just put enough pressure on just cut the circulation off a tiny bit so the person just gets like they die over a 30-year period something like that so yeah and you all laugh because you know it's true that's why and we will say some evil beast half devoured him which would be true actually it would be the evil beast that's inside the brothers and we shall see what will become of his dreams haha that's a that's interesting too because so they want to spite themselves because maybe Joseph is something special and then they want to spite their father which is probably not the wisest idea because they owe him some gratitude I mean maybe he's acting like a pain in the neck there's some evidence for that but this is a little bit harsh but they also want to spite God just like Cain did because that's what it means we shall see what will become of his dreams right because then as soon as you're in some sense trying to fight against the intuition of someone the natural intuition of someone you set yourself up against the structure of being itself and so pretty bad and Ruben heard it and he delivered them out of their hands and said no let us not kill him and Ruben said unto them shed no blood but cast him into this pit that's in the wilderness it's like Rubens the good guy in this story yeah and and there's no water in the pit by the way inlay no hand upon him that he might rid him out of their hands to deliver him to his father again hmm so Ruben was actually trying to save him said he might rid him out of their hands to deliver him to his father again and it came to pass when Joseph came unto his brethren that they stripped him of his coat his coat of many colors that was on him and they took him and cast him into a pit and the pit was empty and there was no water in it and then they sat down to eat bread and lifted up their eyes and looked and behold a company of Ishmaelites come came from Gilead with their camels bearing spices and balm and myrrh going to carry it down to Egypt and Judah said unto his brethren how does it profit us if we kill our brother and conceal his blood so he's the practical guy here's what why would we kill him when we can sell him it's like come let us sell him to the Ishmaelites and let not our hand be upon him for he is our brother in our flesh and his brethren were content then there passed by Midianites merchantman and they drew and lifted up joseph out of the pit and sold joseph to the Ishmaelites for 20 pieces of silver it's a amount that echoes through into the future and they brought Joseph into Egypt I'm never really sure how these slavery stories work it's like so it's two 2,500 3,000 years ago and I decided I'm gonna sell you to the Ishmaelites and that just works out they I get the money you get to be a slave and they take you away I don't really understand how that works I can't figure out how people weren't just selling each other all the time but maybe if your family you can do it so they're they sold him and Reuben returned to the pit and behold Joseph was not there and Reuben rent his clothes so Reubens very upset about this and he returned unto his brothers and said the child is not and I where shall I go and they conspired they took Joseph's coat and killed a kid of the goats and dipped the coat in the blood that's interesting too because blood is actually another color right so he's got this coat of many colors and blood is definitely a color and so this is the addition in some sense of the color of blood to Joseph's coat and I would say it's probably a necessary color because I don't think that you're serious enough till your coat has been dipped in blood that can happen in many ways and they sent the coat of many colors and they brought it to their father and said so they lied to him it's very very nasty business this they they sell his son to slavery they claim that he's dead they lied to him they they put him into an extreme state of grief there's a lot of hatred underneath that right tremendous amount of hatred for Joseph and also for Jacob this we have found know now whether it be thy sons coat or not and he knew it he said it's my son's coat and evil beast has devoured him Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces and Jacob tore his clothes and put sackcloth on his loins and mourned for many days and all his sons and daughters rose up to comfort him but he refused to be comforted and he said I'll go down unto my grave mourning my son does his father wept for him so that's Jacob collapsing at the news and the Midianites sold Joseph into Egypt unto Potiphar an officer of Pharaohs and captain of the guard and Joseph was brought down to Egypt and port afar an officer of Pharaoh captain of the guard and Egyptian bought him of the hands of the Ishmaelites which had brought him down thither so now he's a slave so now you'd think well that would be this is a man who has a lot of reason to be irritated at the structure of reality right he's gone from being the favorite to being betrayed by all of his brothers that's pretty rough and then he's being transformed into a slave and now he's being he's being sold to work as a slave so you'd think that that would corrupt his character because you know one of the things I think this is the case anyways I think people are always looking for an excuse to have their character corrupted because if your character is corrupted then you get to lie and you get to cheat you get to steal and you get to betray and you get to act resentfully and you get to do nothing and that's all easy it's easier to lie than to tell the truth it's easier to do nothing than to do something so there's always part of you thinking well I need a justification for being useless and horrible because that'd be a lot less work and so then if something terrible comes along you think AHA that's just exactly the excuse that I was waiting for and then out all that comes you know Solzhenitsyn when he was in the concentration camps in Russia watching how people behaved you know he said that there were people that were put in the camps who immediately became trustees or guards and they were even more vicious than the people who had been hired as guards and his idea was that they had collected all that he called it foul Ness if I remember correctly around them in normal life but they didn't have the opportunity to express it but as soon as you gave them the opportunity it was like there it was right away and so so one of the messages that seems to echo through these old testament stories is that just because something terrible happens to you doesn't mean that you get to be that you get to wander off the path and make things worse and maybe it doesn't matter how terrible it is that what happens to you that's a tough call you know because you see people now and then in life who they've really got it rough man like 50 bad things are happening to them at the same time and you think oh it's no wonder if you were bitter and resentful and hostile be like yeah no wonder but then you meet people and Solzhenitsyn again talked about this in the Gulag Archipelago he said he met lots of people in the North Lodz he met enough people to impress him in the concentration camp system who didn't allow their misfortunes to corrupt them and that's something because maybe the only real misfortune is to become corrupted that's a really useful thing to think you know maybe the rest of it maybe the rest of it is trivial in comparison I know that's a rough thing because you can be in very harsh circumstances but I do think there's something to that and the Lord was with Joseph and he was a prosperous man and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian and his master saw that the Lord was with him and that Lord made all that he did to prosper in his hand so that's an echo of the idea that we encountered earlier about walking with God right so Adam walked with God before he ate the fruit with Eve and then he wouldn't walk with God and then Noah walked with God and Abraham walked with God and so the idea is well that's that alignment with the highest ideal I think it's something like that and you know we could think about that as a metaphysical claim as well but I don't think it is I mean I've got thousands of letters now in the last year from people who have told me that they were in a pit that's exactly right and that they decided that they were going to try to put their lives together and that it worked and so that's really something you know when they write surprised it's like well I decided that I was gonna work hard at what I was doing and I wasn't gonna lie any more than absolutely necessary I thought I'd give it a try for a few months you know and all sorts of good things started to happen to me it's like maybe that's how the world works now obviously it doesn't work like that all the time right because you can get sliced off at the knees I mean there's an arbitrary element to existence that that you can't wish away but that doesn't mean that there are it doesn't mean that there aren't bad strategies and good strategies and so I do think that one of the most fundamental existential questions is like if things aren't going well for you and your life is are you absolutely certain that you're doing absolutely everything you can to put things in order because if you're not then you shouldn't complain because you don't know to what degree you're actually contributing or even causing the circumstance now that's a very annoying thing to think and I'm not trying to blame the victim you know I know that people end up with lung cancer because they were exposed to asbestos you know and I'm not trying to although I also know too that if you have lung cancer because you've been exposed to asbestos that can be a tragedy or it can be hell and to some degree that depends on how you conduct yourself so I mean I know that's pretty gloomy possibilities right but so anyway so Joseph is a slave but it turns out that he's uh he hasn't sacrificed the integrity of his character and so it turns out that being it turns out that he's not a slave it's just that everyone around him thinks he's a slave but he's not so that's pretty interesting he was a goodly person and well favored well so he's a good guy and he's an impressive specimen as well this is pretty interesting given the current political climate I would say and it came to pass after these things that his master's wife cast her eyes upon Joseph and she said lie with me that means that actually has two meanings right but he refused and said unto his master's wife behold my master does not know what's with me in the house and he's committed all that he has to my hand there's no one greater in this house than I neither hath he kept back anything for me but you because you are his wife how then can I do this great wickedness wickedness and sin against God and it came to pass as she spake to Joseph day by day that he hearkened not unto her to lie by her or be with her it's being sexually harassed Joseph and it came to pass well its rounds right I mean look look at the painting and it came to pass about this time that Joseph went into the house to do his business and there was none of the men of the house there with in and she caught him by his garment saying lie with me and he left his garment in her hand and fled and got him out so that's so kind of embarrassing for poor Joseph I would say and a bit on the suspicious side and it came to pass when she saw that he had left his garment in her hand and was fled forth that she called unto the men of her house and spake unto them see see he hath brought in a Hebrew to mark us he came in unto you lie with me and I cried with a loud voice so what is it hell hath no fury like a woman scorned that's the proper commentary on that and it came to pass when he heard that I lifted up my voice and cried that he left his garment with me and fled and got himself out and it came to pass when his master heard the words of his wife so that's the farro which she spake unto him saying after this manner did thy servant to me his wrath was kindled and joseph's master took him and put him in prison a place where the Kings prisoners were was were bound and he was there in the prison well that sort of sucks it's like first his brothers betray him and throw him in a pit and then he gets made a slave which is probably better than being in the pit and then he becomes sort of like King slaves so that's working out pretty well and now someone lies about him he gets betrayed again and now it's into the prison with him and so it's this it's this again right it's the same thing it's Sisyphus up with the rock and then down and it's order chaos order chaos and then you have to think well are you the order or you the chaos or you the thing that's moving between them because that's the right thing to be because otherwise you're just order and that's a really bad idea or you're just chaos and that's a really bad idea you can be the thing that's dynamically mediating between them and that's what he's doing but the Lord was with Joseph and showed him mercy and gave him favor in the sight of the keeper of the prison that's no easy thing to do I would think you know it's like you're thrown in prison and now the jailer likes you now how exactly are you going to manage that it's a good thing to think about because you might think well if you were really in dire straits how is it that you should conduct yourself so that you have the highest probability of having things work out and it's not saying well Joseph took over the thumbscrew you know and started using that on the other prisoners that that's not the indication here at all it's that he's doing something he's acting like a person who isn't a prisoner even though he's in the prison just like he was acting like someone who wasn't a slave when he was a slave and so it makes you wonder who you can be despite the fact that other people think that you're whatever you appear to be and the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison and whatsoever they did there he was the doer of it the keeper of the prison looked not to anything that was under his hand because the Lord was with him and that which he did the Lord made it to prosper so it's a repeat its a repeat of exactly what happened when he was the slave of the Pharaoh except it's one rung deeper into hell so to speak right so it's slave Pharaoh and here it's prisoner jail master but it doesn't matter the same thing happens so now Joseph is imprisonment the Pharaoh has a fit one day of peak and throws the chief of his Butler's into prison and the chief of his Baker's and they have a dream each of them and Joseph interprets the dreams seems to be something that he can do and he tells the butler that his dream means that the Pharaoh was going to forgive him and put him back in his position and he tells the baker that the Pharaoh isn't going to forgive him and that he's going to take off his head and hang him in a tree which was rather rough dream but that is what huh that's what happens so anyways that the Baker or the butler goes free and Joseph says look you know maybe you could just keep in mind the fact that I did you a bit of a favor here and told you something that was accurate but the chief didn't really remember once he once he was freed interpreting dreams in prison and so now the Pharaoh has a dream and he actually has two dreams so it's another one of those doubled motifs so the ideas these are really important dreams because they came in a pair and behold there came out of the river seven well-favored kind and fat flesh so cattle and they fed the men Oh meadow and behold seven other cattle came up after the Mount of the river ill-favored and lean fleshed starving and stood by the other cows on the brink of the river and the ill-favored and lean flesh I did eat up the seven well-favored and fat so Pharaoh awoke hey fair enough it's pretty nasty dream and then he has another dream to hit it home and he slept and dreamt the second time and behold seven years of corn came up upon one stalk rankin good and behold seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind sprung up after them and the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears and Pharaoh awoke and beheld it was a dream and then it says a little later and for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice it is because the thing is established by God and God will shortly bring it to pass it's interesting you know because one of the better theories about dreams is that they're part of the way that the right and left hemisphere communicate or maybe the nonverbal part of the brain communicates with the verbal brand verbal part of the brain and so the nonverbal part of the brain which is less differentiated and thinks more globally is looking for patterns and anomalies in the world things that don't fit well with the current way of conceptualizing the world things that make you anxious and uncertain and those are things you haven't mastered right so they don't fit well into your conceptualization of the world by definition because if you had mastered them they wouldn't make you anxious nervous and so the the nonverbal parts of your brain are like an alarm system they're looking around for places where you're probably wrong and then they put those in images and try to conceptualize them so that you can update your model of reality to take them into account but that also produces a fair bit of negative emotion especially at night and so so we know that we know if you deprive people of dreams that they go insane very rapidly animals as well necessary part of mental equilibrium the way you do that with rats in case you want to know is that you've got rats that you want to drive insane this is how you do it so you put the rat on a like a pedestal that's pretty small and then when you fall it's surrounded by water and then when he falls asleep his nose hits the water then he wakes up and so you can deprive the rat of sleep and that doesn't the rats don't respond to very well after some period of time so that's one of the ways that that's been discovered but anyways the dream does seem to be an update mechanism and so if if you have a very powerful dream like a nightmare especially if it's repeating it's like something is trying to hammer on the door that needs to be let in and often you don't know how to let it in that's that's a problem so but then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph because he had talked to his his Butler and they brought him hastily out of the dungeon and Joseph shaved himself and changed his clothes and came in unto Pharaoh I guess he didn't want a shark Pharaoh with how people dressed in the prison and Pharaoh said unto Joseph I've dreamed a dream and there's none that can interpret it I've heard say of thee that you could understand a dream to interpret it and Joseph said it's not me God will give Pharaoh an answer of peace it's so Jacob isn't taking credit for his ability to interpret dreams which also indicates quite interestingly there's there's nothing that despite the fact that he's successful incompetent he's not narcissistic like if he happens to have this gift he regards it as a gift and not as something that you know renounced his favor it's just something that he happens to be able to do and so that's that's a hallmark of someone who's got a pretty well put-together personality as far as I'm concerned because you know people have gifts that they didn't really earn those would be your talents your intelligence your good looks if you happen to have good looks etc and they're not there's no sense being all puffed up about that because it's it's great it's luck of the draw though and the proper attitude is to note that it's luck of the draw to be grateful for it it's quite a fine painting that one behold there come seven years of great plenty throughout the island of Egypt and then there shall arise after them seven years of famine and all the plenty shall be forgotten and the famine shall consume the land and the Plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following issue for it shall be very Grievous so now we to that Jacob he can interpret dreams but he's also the sort of person who can look into the future and think this is sort of what Adam was called on to do when he got kicked out of the garden of paradise is you're going to be able to conceptualize that even if things are going well now that that doesn't mean that they're going to go well into the future and so he's the aunt and not the grasshopper right in the grasshopper and the ant story it's like everything's good but you should wake the hell up and you should test to see how things can go wrong and you can see if your systems can survive them things going wrong and which is something that I think we could all hearken to because I think we do a very bad job in the modern world of testing to see if our systems can go wrong okay so the Pharaoh was pretty impressed by this dream interpretation and pretty worried about it and I guess he's a reasonable person despite the fact that he put Joseph in jail I guess he didn't have much choice now therefore let Pharaoh look for a man dis discreet and wise and set him over the land of Egypt let Pharaoh do this and let him appoint officers over the land this is what Joseph is saying and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years and let them gather all the food of those good years that come and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh and let them keep food in the cities and just like that Joseph is restored to his position so Pharaoh said unto Joseph I am Pharaoh and without thee shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all of the land of Egypt and so he comes out of the prison and he really in some sense as far as I'm concerned he actually occupies a position that's higher than the position of the Pharaoh depends on how you look at it because the Pharaoh has relegated himself to ceremonial status right Joseph has all the responsibilities makes all the decisions so de-facto he's the pharaoh he doesn't get the glory precisely although he's not doing too bad for himself not there's a lesson in that too I wrote these rules for Quora a long time ago and one of them I've written them into this some of them into this book you guys got a pamphlet about today one of the rules that I didn't write about was um note that responsive note that opportunity lurks where responsibility has been abdicated which is really interesting I think I mean I've seen people in their jobs they say things like well my the guy I work with doesn't do any work it's like well you could do it I mean I know there's limits to that but one of the things you can do at work is make yourself indispensable I mean you might get the cane types against you if you do that but there's something to be said for being indispensable because when people start to be dispensed with you probably won't be one of them or even if you are then the fact that you're indispensable just means you can go somewhere else and be indispensable there and that's just as useful so it's very very difficult to permanently put down someone who's really good at doing things because they can just go off and do them somewhere else and one of the ways that you get like that is to take responsibility when someone else is failing to do so and you think well I shouldn't have to do that that's one way of thinking about it another way of thinking about it is oh good I get to do that and the seven years of plenty estas that was in the land of Egypt were ended and the seven years of dearth began to come according as joseph has said and the dearth was in all the lands well that's an archetypal story right in the archetypal story it's the business cycle story it's a little harsher when you're starving obviously but that's not the point the point is is that sometimes things are getting good and sometimes things are getting bad and that's you can be sure that that's the case that's gonna happen to you and so the wise person takes stock of the fact that things are going to get bad is this is the same thing that happens with Noah it's like assume the flood cuz it's gonna happen and you think well it's a hell of a world that has floods it's like not if you have a boat right it it helps a lot if you if there's a flood and you have a boat it's like you can float on the flood and then it's not such a problem and so if you refuse to look not the fact that things are going to be going downhill bad and that you're going to be in a pit at some point you and your family perhaps then when it happens it will be as bad as it possibly can be but if you're awake and alert to that possibility then you can mitigate it and the dearth was in all the lands but in the land of Egypt there was bread and when the land of Egypt was famished the people cried to Pharaoh for bread and Pharaoh said unto the Egyptians go to Joseph what he says to you to do you do that and the famine was all over the face of the earth and Joe Joseph opened up the storehouses and sold to the Egyptians and the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt and all the countries came into Egypt to buy to Joseph to buy corn because the famine was sore in all the lands now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt Jacob said unto his sons why are you standing around looking at each other he said I've heard that there's corn in Egypt get down there and buy from by for us so that we may live and not die it's a pretty straightforward advice that and Joseph's ten brothers went down to buy corn in Egypt but Benjamin Joseph's brother so that's the youngest one right the only one left it's the one that was younger than Joseph the only youngest one and also rachel's other son but Jeb Benjamin Joseph's brother Jacob didn't send because he was worried that something bad would happen to him which kind of indicates to me that maybe Jacob was a bit suspicious about what had happened to Joseph the last time he sent all the brothers on a adventure and Joseph was the governor over all the land and and he it was that sold to all the people of the land and Joseph's brothers came and bowed down themselves before him with their faces to the earth well there's the dream now the thing is too is that one question you have in your life is who should you bow down to and you might say no one that's not exactly the right answer because that means that you don't have an ideal because you bow down to your ideal that's what makes it an ideal and if you don't have an ideal then what the hell are you do so you have to bow down to something and so what happens here is well the brothers are bowing down to the person who's so bloody resilient and competent that they can take themselves out of a prison and become the ruler of the land that happened to vaclav havel right in czechoslovakia it also happened to Mandela in South Africa like these things actually happen it's really something so you god only knows what you might learn in prison so so they bow down to Joseph and properly so you know he's he is even without his coat he's still the person with the coat of many colors and Joseph saw his brothers and he knew them but he made them so strange unto them it's a number of years have passed and he spoke roughly unto them and he said unto them where do you come from and they said from the land of Canaan to buy food and Joseph knew whose brothers were but they didn't know who he was and they came back to Jacob their father and told him all that befell him and said the man whose Lord of the country spoke roughly to us and took us for spies and we said to him where were true men honest men we're not spies we be twelve brothers sons of our fathers one is not and the youngest is this day with our Father in the land of Canaan and the man said here's how I'll know that you're honest men leave one of the brothers here with me and take some food for the famine of your households and be gone and then bring your youngest brother to me then I'll know that you're not spies but that you're honest men and I'll deliver the other brother and he shall trade in the land so you don't have to starve to death and it came to pass as they emptied their sacks that behold every man's bundle of money was in his sock and when both they and their father saw the bundles of money they were afraid so they had bought food from Joseph and he gave them the food and then he put all their money back and their socks which I could imagine would worry them to some degree and Jacob said me you have already believed of my children Joseph is not as Simeon is not now you'll take Benjamin Benjamin away all these things are against me and Reuben spake unto his father saying slay my two sons if bring him not to thee deliver him into my hand and I will bring him to the again and he and he said no my son shall not go down with you for his brother is dead and he's left alone if mischief befall him by the way in the which you shall go then you shall bring down my great gray hairs with sorrow to the grave now there's a hint see what happens in the last part of the Jacob storage the Joseph's story is and this is associated with the idea of putting your house in order your individual house in order and then putting your family's house in order let's say reversed a little bit in this story because Joseph puts himself together and then he puts the state of Egypt in order which is really quite interesting because Egypt is the canonical tyranny right in the Old Testament and so the idea is very very clear here that the person who wears the coat of many colors can put the tyranny right and then the next extension is well he has to put his family right now you know generally the progression would be put yourself right then put your family right then put the state right something like that it doesn't really hit if you can do it in a different order that's probably ok too but so so that's what happens at the end of the story is that you know Joseph is doing pretty damn well and so is the state that he serves but that isn't good enough for him he wants his family to be functional and put together properly even though they did terrible things to him and that's very interesting because once someone does terrible things to you then the logical thing or a logical thing to think is well go to hell in a handbasket you know like you deserve exactly what you get but it's not a very productive attitude especially if you're around people that you have to be around you know so like if it's your family and you go have a family dinner and one of you punches the other and then the other punches you back and then that's like the family dinner for the next thirty years it doesn't seem to be very productive even if you're the person who happened to get in the last blow because you're gonna have to put up with them at minimum it might be nice to just let what you can go go and work to make towards making things better have to get rid of the idea of revenge and resentment and all those things that you carry along but but it's probably better to think about how your family could be if it was really functioning well and then just a money Ringley at that no no that's not easy I mean people are very screw in there's no end to the depths of Pathology within families but of course this story states that very clearly I mean they tried to kill him they've sold him into slavery it's it's a pathological family let's put it that way and but Joseph's attitude is well we got to set this right not least because of his father but it isn't only because of his father as you see and as the story unfolds and the famine was sore in the land and it came to pass when they had eaten up the corn which they had brought out of Egypt their father said unto them go again and buy us a little food and Judah spake unto him saying the man did solemnly protest unto us you not see you will not see my face except your brother be with you they can't go back to Egypt without Benjamin and they said the man asked us straightly of our state and of her kindred saying is your father yet alive have you another brother and we told him according to the tenor of those words could we know that he would say bring your brother down and Judah said unto Israel his father send the loud with me and will arise and go that we may live and not die both we and vow and also our little ones I will be surety for him my hand shall they'll require him if I bring him not unto thee and set them before thee then let me bear the blame forever well so Judah who played a pretty dismal role in the original selling Joseph into slavery seems to obviously have learned something by this point since he's willing to put himself on the line you know to take responsibility for the situation and to put himself on the line and to stand in for Benjamin so he's making himself into a sacrificial object of sorts and so the game that Joseph's playing cuz he's sort of teasing his brothers but he's also testing them the game that he's playing is tuefel is one is have you bloody well learned anything or are you just as corrupt and useless as you were before that's game number one in game number two is maybe if I poke and prod you and put you into a relatively difficult and mysterious situation I can get you to clue the hell in and the Dorp some responsibilities and we can move this whole mess forward and so that seems to be happening so Judah is taking responsibility and Reuben did that as well and the men took presence and they took double money in their hand and Benjamin and rose up and went down to Egypt and stood before Joseph and when Joseph saw Benjamin with them he said to the ruler of his house bring these men home and slay and make ready food for these men shall dine with me at noon and the men man did as Joseph bade and the man brought the men into Joseph's house and when Joseph came home they brought him the presents which was in their hand and bowed themselves again to him to the earth and he asked them of their welfare and said is your father well the old man of whom you spake is whom you spake is he yet alive and they answered thy servant our Father is in good health he's yet alive and they bowed down their heads and made obeisance and he lifted up his eyes and saw his brother Benjamin his mother's son and said is this your younger brother of whom you spake unto me and he said God be gracious unto thee my son and Joseph made haste for his bowels did yearn upon his brother and he saw it where to weep and he entered into his chamber and wept there and he washed his face and went out and refrained himself and said set on the bread and they sat before them now he plays another trick on his brother so he has them all sit at the table but he lines them up according to age and so he's trying to what is he trying to do start to freak them out fundamentally and so it and he manages that because they have no idea how in the world they could possibly he could possibly pull something like that off they think it's magic and the men marvelled at one another and he took and sent messes unto them from before him but Benjamin's mess was five times as much as any of theirs so what's he doing well he's testing his brothers again the fact that when he was the child Joseph that he got more meant that his brothers got terribly jealous and then murderous right and so now he's doing the same thing with Benjamin he's thinking okay well I'll give this kid more mm-hmm then he is share you know what how these reprobates behave and see if they've learned anything and so and he commanded the steward of his house saying fill the men's sock with food as much as they can carry and put every money man's money in the sock as well and put my cup the silver cup in the sacks mouth of the youngest and his corn money and the steward did according to the word that Joseph had spoken as soon as the morning was light the men were sent away along with their transportation the cup is found in Benjamin's sack well so Benjamin is kind of young and Joseph sends out people to find out where the cup has gone and they find it in Benjamin's in Benjamin's sock and they're very upset about this they said that a harsh punishment would befall whoever had the cup in his sock they rent their clothes and laid it every man his house and returned to this city and Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house for he was they yet there and they fell before him on the ground very unhappy and apologetic and Joseph said unto them what deed is this that you have done ha ha ha don't you know that a man like I can certainly divine I know what's going on and Judah said what shall we say what shall we speak or how can we possibly clear ourselves God found out the iniquity of thy servants behold we are your servants both we and also he with whom the cup is found and he said God forbid that I should do so but the man in whose cup and whose hand the cup has found he shall be my servant and as for you get you up in peace to your father it's the discovery of the cup Judis says now therefore when I come to this servant thy father my father and the loud be not with us and seeing that his life is bound up in the lads life it shall come to pass when he sees that the lad is not with us that he will die and the servants shall bring down the gray hairs of thy servant or father with sorrow to the grave for thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father saying if I bring him not unto thee then I shall bear the blame to my father forever now therefore I pray thee let me stay instead of the lad and let the lad go with his brothers for how shall I go up to my brother and the loud be not with me lest peradventure I shall see the evil that will come on my father ok so what's happened well they learned a lesson so now Judah again is willing to stand in the place of Benjamin and become a slave himself and so now Joseph has determined that his brothers have developed their character to the point where reconciliation might be possible you know it says you should forgive and forget but the conditions for that are quite are quite specific you know if you're if you have a dispute with someone and they've wronged you in some sense and they apologize the question is what's the apology well it's a it's layout of a rationale it's something like as far as I can tell here's the reasons I did this horrible thing and here's what I've learned from it and here's what I'm gonna do to try not to do it again and would you give me another crack at it that's the proper repentance right and then you forgive because you're an idiot too and you'll probably do something stupid and maybe you'd like the same kind of break at some point and and besides if we all held each other completely to account at all possible times for everything then it'd just be hopeless because there would be no room for error so the forgiveness which Joseph is showing is wise forgiveness he's not gonna put himself out on the line for people who haven't learned so that the same stupid thing can happen again so that they can continue to spread misery wherever they go oh he's gonna find out if they've clued in a little bit and then if so then they can move on with putting a family together and so that breaks him up he says Joseph could not refrain himself before all of them that stood by him and he cried and then he said get every man away from me so all the people except for Joseph's brother left and there stood no man with him well Joseph made himself known unto his brothers and Joseph said I'm Joseph is my father still alive and his brothers could not answer for they were troubled at his presence it's like yeah understatement of the decade there mmm when Joseph said unto his brothers come nearer to me I pray you and they came nearer and he said I am Joseph your brother who you sold into Egypt but don't be grieved or angry with yourself that you sold me hither for God did send me before you to preserve life so now it was not you that sent me here but God and he's made me a father to Pharaoh and Lord of all his house and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt hurry and go to my father and say unto Him thus say thy son Joseph God has made me Lord of all GE gypped come down unto me and Terry nod and thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen and thou shalt be near unto me thou and thy children and their children's children and thy flocks and they herds and all that thou hast and I there I will nourish you for yet there are five years of famine lest thou and I household and all that thou hast come to poverty so that's the other thing that another bit of a hint it's a bread hint here who's the what's the most reliable source of bread well it isn't bread itself it's whatever it is that gives rise to bread and that's what Joseph is in this story he's the force that gives ride rise to nourishment that's an Joseph is often considered a type of Christ which means like a precursor in some sense that's that's one way of thinking about it and you can see that echoed right there it's like well what do you store up for famine you stir up character that's the best way through now that doesn't mean you don't also store up bread andd they went out of Egypt and came into the land of Canaan unto Jacob and told him Josephus is still alive and he's governor and Jacob's heart fainted for he didn't believe them they told him all the words of Joseph which he said to them and when he saw all the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him the spirit of Jacob their father revived and Israel said it is enough Joseph my son is yet alive I will go and see him before I die and Israel took his journey with all that he had and came to Beersheba and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father Isaac and God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night and said Jacob and he said here am i he said I am God the God of thy father don't fear to go to eat down into Egypt for I will make you a great nation there and so that's how they Israelites end up in Egypt I will go down with the into Egypt and I will also surely bring the up again and Jacob shall put his hand upon thy eyes die dies and Jacob rose up from Beersheba and the sons of Israel carried Jacob their father and their little ones and their wives in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him so the families now all united in the proper state of being that joseph has arranged and they took their cattle and their goods it's so interesting too because of course Joseph isn't even he's a foreigner as well as being a former slave and prisoner foreigner slave and prisoner and yet he ends up ruling Egypt sure surely because of the force of his character and competence and that's really something to think about and they took their cattle because that story there is that there isn't anything stronger than that doesn't matter what the circumstances are that there isn't a force that's more powerful than that and I don't think that that's naive in fact I think it's the exact opposite of naive no matter where you are you can generally make things better if that's what you want to do and unless you're inside in that place that's really hell itself not usually is something that elevates you and elevates the people around you and you can do that wherever you are because there isn't a place that sews all that you can't do that that's the message of the prison and they took their cattle and their goods which they had gotten in the land of Canaan and came into Egypt Jacob and all his seed with him and he sent Judah before him unto Joseph to direct his face unto Gorshin and they came into the land of gaussian and Joseph made ready his chariot and went to meet Israel his father and presented himself to him and fell on his neck and wept on his neck a good while and Israel said I can now die because I've seen your face because you're still alive and Pharaoh spake unto Joseph saying thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee and the land of Egypt is before thee and the best of the land your father and brothers can dwell in the land of gaash and let them dwell and if there now know any man of activity among them then make them rulers over my cattle gives them a job and Joseph brought in Jacob is farther and set him before Pharaoh and Jacob blessed Pharaoh that's a very interesting little turn of events because you'd expect the opposite under those circumstances so it appears that Jacob was a man of relatively great self possession because that's not it you wouldn't bless Queen Elizabeth in all likelihood su had a lot of gall and pharaoh said unto Jacob how old are you and Jacob said I'm a hundred and thirty years whew and evil have been the days of the years of my life and I've not attained unto the days of the years of my love the life of my fathers in the days of their pilgrimage Jacob blessed the Pharaoh and went out from before Pharaoh and Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt in the country of Gaussian and grew and multiplied exceedingly and Jacob lived in the land of Egypt 17 years so the whole age of Jacob was 147 years and the time drew nigh that Israel must die and he called his son Joseph and said unto Him if I have now found grace in it in thy sight put I pray thee the hand under my thigh and deal kindly and truly with me bury me not I pray thee in Egypt but I will lie with my fathers and thou shall carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their burying place and Joseph said I will do as you have said and it came to pass after these things that one told Joseph behold thy father is sick and he took with him his two sons Manasseh and Ephraim and one told Jacob and said behold thy son and one told Jacob and said behold thy son Joseph cometh unto thee and his real strength in himself and sat upon the bed and he Israel said unto Joseph I'd not thought to see your face and lo God also showed me your children and Joseph brought them out from between his knees and bowed himself with his face to the earth and Joseph took them both Ephraim in his right hand towards Israel's left hand and menace' and his left hand toward Israel's right hand and brought them near unto Him and Israel stretched out his right hand and laid it upon ephram's head who was the younger and his left hand upon manases head guiding his hands purposefully for manna so was the firstborn and when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on the head of Ephraim it displeased him and he held up his father's hand to remove it from Ephraim's head unto manases head and joseph said unto his father not not so my father for this is the firstborn put the right hand upon his head head and his father refused and said I know it my son I know it he shall also become a people and he shall also be great but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he and his seed shall become a multitude of Nations another repeat of the same thing that happens continually it says when when God wants to intervene in human affairs what he does is invert tradition it's something like that and so that's a sign that that there's something new and special going on and that gives precedence to the younger child rather than the older child precedents to what is new rather than what's traditional of course sometimes that's necessary because tradition is insufficient and sometimes something new has to come into being in order to update it and Jacob called together his sons and said gather together so that I can tell you that which shall befall you in the last days gather yourself together and here you sons of Jacob and hearken unto Israel your father Reuben I'm not going to go through all 12 of these Reuben thou art my firstborn my might and the beginning of my strength the excellency of dignity and the excellency of power now the stories interesting here because Jacob blesses Joseph's sons before he blesses his own sons and so what he's doing is placing the rights of the firstborn into the sons of his favorite son and then he goes to his sons and so that has implications for the way the biblical stories lay themselves out from thenceforward the excellency of dignity and the excellency of power unstable as water thou shalt not excel because thou wentest up to thy father's bed then defiled it he went up to my couch you may remember that Reuben slept with his father's cucum concubine Simeon and Levi are brethren instruments of cruelty are in their habitations stop painting there what happened with Simeon and Levi was that somebody lay with their sister Dinah and then offered to marry her and then head and then became circumcised because that was part of the deal and then held her older men circumcised and then Simeon and Levi went in when they were recovering and killed them all and then Jacob and all his people had to leave because all that irritated their relatives so see me Simeon and Levi are brethren instruments of Cruelty are in their habitations o my soul come not thou into their secret unto their assembly mine honor be not thou United for in their anger they slew a man and in their self self will they dig down a wall cursed be their anger for it was fierce and their route for it was cruel I will divide them in Jacob and scatter them in Israel Judah thou art he whom my brethren shall praise thy hand shall be in the neck of mine enemies thy father's children shall bow down before thee Judah is a lion's whelp from the prey my son thou art gone up he stooped down he couched as a lion and as an old lion who shall rouse him up the scepter shall not depart from Judah nor a lawgiver from between his feet until shiloh come and unto him shall the gathering of the people be Joseph a fruitful bough even a fruitful bough by a well whose branch has run over the wall the archers have sorely grieved him and shot at him and hated him but his bull abode in strength and the arms of his hands were made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob for thence is the shepherd the stone of Israel even by the god of life farther who shall help thee and by their almighty he shall bless thee with the blessings of heavens above blessings of the deep that lieth under blessings of the beasts breasts and of the womb the blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills they shall be on the head of Joseph and on the crown of the head of him that was separate from his brethren all these are the twelve tribes of Israel and this is it that their father spake unto them and blessed them everyone according to his blessing he blessed them so that what we see here is an echo in some sense of what happens in the Mesopotamian creation story wind in the Mesopotamian creation story is the dragon of chaos timeout and her consort AB su freshwater and saltwater respectively and their mingled together and and that combination of chaos and order gives rise to the first Assembly of the ancient gods and then the ancient gods kill app soo casually and foolishly and enraged time at with their foolishness and ignorance and she comes back with a vengeance in the meantime and then she produces this huge army of monsters and puts King knew the worst of the monsters at its head and then decides she's going to take out her creation and so that's a little warning from 3,000 years ago about foolishly undermining your tradition so anyways the gods in their frenzy go out and try to fight against timeout and they come back with her tails between their legs continually but then a new God appears on the scene and that's Marduk he's got eyes all the way around his head and he can speak words of magic and they know that there's something new about this newest God it his capacity for vision in this capacity for articulate speech and so they say well why don't you go out and try to deal with the chaos and mardik says yeah ok no problem but here's the deal you elect me talk God and now I determine the destiny of the world and so they're desperate because like timeout is coming to get them that's chaos with the worst of all possible monsters they're probably thinking he's not gonna win anyways and so they agree and out he goes and he confronts time out who's the goddess of chaos he cuts her into pieces and he makes the world out of her pieces and one of his name's is he who makes ingenious things out of the combat with taya math which is so interesting that's such a remarkable that's a remarkable bit of nomenclature so who's should be at the pinnacle the force that sees and speaks and goes out to confront chaos voluntarily you know how many years it took people to figure that out that's like the pinnacle discovery of humanity that's what that is it's echoed here you know you see Simeon and Levi they're too angry the other brothers they all have flaws and faults of various sorts and so they're not elevated to the highest place but Joseph because he has his coat of many colors and because he lands on his feet no matter where he goes and because he's not resentful and bitter and malevolent and genocide 'el and and he's not shaking his fist at the sky or yelling at God because of Trump let's say then he's the he's the right he's the right representative of the 12 tribes and so that's brilliant it's a brilliant story all these are the twelve tribes of Israel and this is it that their fathers spake unto them and blessed them every one according to his blessing he blessed them and when Jacob had made an end of commanding his son so it's the last thing he does to state he knows that these are the twelve tribes that will progress into the future of this people and now he's trying it the last thing he does is to try to hierarchically organized their relative virtues as an indication of what has been learned and when jacob has made an end of commanding his sons he gathered up his feet into the bed and yielded up the ghost and was gathered unto his people and joseph fell upon his father's face and wept upon him and kissed him and Joseph commanded his servants to the physicians to embalm his father and the physicians embalmed Israel when the days of his mourning were passed Joseph spake unto the house of Pharaoh saying if now I have found grace in your eyes speak I pray you in the ears of Pharaoh saying my father made me swear saying lo I die in my grave which I have digged for me in the land of Canaan there shalt thou bury me now therefore let me go up I pray thee and bury my father and I will come again and Pharaoh said go up and bury thy father according as he made thee swear for his sons carried him into the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah which Abraham bought with the field for a possession of the burying place of Ephraim the head before Mamre and Joseph returned unto Egypt he and his brethren and all that went up to him and that all and all that went up with him to burry his father after he is buried after he had buried his father and when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead they said Joseph will now hate us and will certainly pay back to us all the evil which we did unto him and they sent a messenger saying my father did command before he died saying for shall ye say unto Joseph forgive I pray thee now the trespass of thy brethren and their sin pretty snively really for they did unto the evil and now we pray they forgive the trespass of the servants of the God of thy father and Joseph wept when they spake unto him and his brethren also went and fell down before his face and they said Behold we be thy servants and Joseph said unto them fear not for am I in the place of God but as for you you thought evil against me but God meant it unto good to bring to pass as it is this day to save much people alive now therefore fear ye not I will nourish you and your little ones any comfort of them and spake kindly unto them so the the idea there is that there is no evil so evil that good cannot triumph over it and Joseph dwelt in Egypt he and his father's house and Joseph lived 110 years and Joseph saw ephram's children of the third generation the children also of marker the son of menace' were brought up upon Joseph's knees and Joseph said unto his brethren I die and God will surely visit you and bring you out of this land unto the land where he swear to Abraham to Isaac and Jacob and Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel saying God will surely visit you and show and you shall carry my bones from hence so Joseph died being a hundred and ten years old and they embalmed him and he was put into a coffin in Egypt and that's Genesis so so thank you all for persevering [Music] thank you thank you well this has been very worthwhile as far as I'm concerned I learned an awful lot and so I'm very much looking forward to continuing with it and thank you all very much for your support and your rapt attention and your seriousness in this endeavor and your care and all of that it's really being a privilege to be able to do this it's a completely surreal thing to manage and so far you know I think about five million people have watched it so that seems to be a very good thing okay so I'm gonna ask the questioners if you've asked a question in the last three sessions please don't ask a question today because I I never get through everyone and so I'd like to have some questions from people that I haven't answered questions from before if that's okay hi professor Peterson just a 2-second thank you very much from my community in the Jewish community so many people have been inspired you by you to be better people and I wouldn't be able to speak to you without saying that so thank you very much a couple of things the first thing I wanted to do is make a quick comment that you might find interesting that in the Jewish astrological calendar we read the 'really cycle of the the five books of Moses and it just so happens that we are reading this part of the of the Torah story school and synchronistic yeah which brings me into a question I want to ask you about which is one question with two parts about your knowledge of Hebrew because if you look at the Torah scrolls that you find in a synagogue there are no vowels there are no sentences there it is it is chaos chaos and order is trying to be bought into it I'm wondering how knowledge of you knowledgeable are you of the Hebrew which has many layers of I'm staggering the ignorant of it so you know I read a lot of commentaries right I'm trying to zero in on the like with each of the phrases that we went through today I probably looked at ten different commentaries and so and then I have this underlying psychoanalytic knowledge that it's sort of like if you have a bunch of different templates to look at things through and then something shines through all those templates at the same time that's very unlikely and so then you can you know a coincidence is one thing but five coincidences that's no longer a coincidence that's something else and so I think I'm hoping that despite the fact that there's many many things that I don't know that there's enough things that I do know to kind of weave my way through this with some degree of utility if not certainty yeah cuz I just which is the second part which I guess maybe you don't know but the the majestic the Jewish oral stories that date back almost as long as these stories which fill in a lot of mind-blowing ly crazy random so many details about these stories and I was just wondering if you had encountered any of them before I've encountered some of them but again it's it's well as you know it's a very very rich tradition and so I haven't encountered enough of it were you thinking of anything in specific specifically in relationship to this story not in particular I actually forgot it I was I was intending to bring you a book of majestic story that's a hell of a thing to say now to say that but yeah maybe for the exodus version I'll bring you this all right all right that would be good yeah okay hi dr."

    "text": "Peterson I would just like to ask you to please talk about what you called a psychic death also known as an ego death okay sorry say that again would you please talk about what you refer to as a psychic death also called an ego death that's what happens when someone who loves you betrays you right so imagine that like the world is complicated beyond comprehension right and you only see a very little bit of it and the way you structure your understanding is you make assumptions about things and they're simplifying assumptions so if you trust someone you reduce their complexity massively right because like let's say we were married then there's a whole bunch of ways that you're going to act that are going to be simpler okay so then I can tolerate being around you in some sense because you're not everything at once now those simplifying structures are hierarchically assembled and some of them are far more important than others Trust is one of them especially trust in loved ones family members which is why betrayal by a family member is really catastrophic because it you know it destabilizes your past right all the memories you have it destabilizes your present it destabilizes your future it shakes your faith in human beings including yourself and everything collapses and that's an ego death and so now underneath the ego as far as Jung was concerned was another structure that he called the self and the self is the thing that remains constant across ego deaths but it's it's deeper and less personal it's archetypal and it's the thing that the Eagle collapses into when it collapses and then that rebuilds the ego something like that across time but that's when an ego death is now there's variants of that because you can have a voluntary or involuntary ego death and a voluntary ego death is when you learn a bunch and you're willing to let go so that would be your own emulation it's like you're lighting you're a Phoenix and your lighting yourself on fire that's a much better idea even though it can still be really harsh the involuntary ego deaths they're really hard on people people will do almost anything to stop that from happening which is partly why they fight to maintain their group fostered axiomatic simplifications it's not surprising because it's very you'd lose your like that ego death is a journey into the underworld or it's a collapse into chaos and that's not so bad if you do it purposefully but in the Pinocchio story for example that's exemplified by Pinocchio going down to the depths to rescue his father from the whale now he does that voluntarily but a damn near kills it right I mean first of all he hardly gets out of the whale second he actually drowns and dies but he comes back to life so even if you do it voluntarily it's still life it's just better than doing it involuntarily which is the other alternative so that's what it is you bet hello Doctor Buddhism so I've been listening to back to all of these biblical lectures for the second time now and I wanted to show you an observation I came upon because I was trying to find a question that you haven't been asked before which is harder than doing my ryerson exams that's for sure so so I've noticed I think you're getting funnier oh yes oh no I think Michael Coren said that this week I think but the word he used was bizarre I think actually I'm feeling better so that's I actually have a sense of humor it's it's hard to believe that but so it sort of comes back when I'm not feeling like I'm going to die at any moment so yeah I basically noticed one you're making more attempts at jokes so that's great thank you thank you too those jokes are landing more often all right but then there's this third element which I think was what Steve Martin quit because of which is that I think the audience is anticipating jokes more and they're actually you know I've noticed people laughing more at things that aren't intending to be jokes so I was just wondering what you make of that and they're intended I'm hoping they're intended just because I keep a straight face doesn't mean they're not intended to be jokes so yeah no it's good look one of the things is like it's and I try to keep this and the wild goal probably about five years ago that even when you're dealing with really serious matters that if you're not handling it with a light touch you're not an expert at it you know what a master out it and you think well there are some things that are so deep and dark that you can't handle it with a light touch and that's actually not true you can that doesn't mean you make light of them it doesn't mean anything like that it's that you don't it's minimal necessary force it's something like that you don't hit it any harder than you have to and it's a it's an art when you're discussing serious matters and so well one of the up shots of that is that because we're discussing serious Madison because serious matters are being discussed in the ultra large right now it would be really good if everybody could keep their sense of humor you know and I see positive signs of that like there's a lot of satirical activity on the net you know and that could easily catalyze into horror mob but it isn't it is it is you know that's happening to some degree but a lot of its satire in comedy and as long as we can keep a sense of humor about this then I think well we're not as close to disaster as we might be and so what one of the things that I have found rather ominous is that there are comedians first of all being persecuted for under free speech restriction legislation which i think is absolutely appalling but also that there are comedians now who won't perform on university campuses John Cleese won't Seinfeld that's like well you know how offensive he is it's no wonder that I mean he's like the straightest nicest comedian you could possibly imagine he won't perform on college campuses I think louis c.k won't perform on or anywhere else but it's a bad sign but no humor humor is good and it's interesting because I've been kind of watching how I'm represented on the web weirdly enough and there's all these memes that have emerged I don't know thousands of the bloody things and most of them are comical and that's good like people are are there hat there whatever it is that they're doing I don't know what the hell it is but it's being done with a relatively light touch and that's really really good that's how it should be you got to have a sense of humor I mean it's one of the things that makes life bearable so or maybe even better than bearable so you bet hello dr."

    "text": "Peterson just want to say what a great lecture series and this is lesson this year so merry Christmas to you and your family thank you thank you don't get too enthusiastic about that I wrote you an essay of a question and then I used the lecture of the essay writing guide on it's like 2:30 to narrow it down to just a few pages a few lines and then during this at this particular lecture like the zig zag slide manifest again and I thought I basically just had all my questions answered so basically I just I want to ask the idea of your you've made a lecture that was on YouTube many years ago and you keep referring to Cain and Abel and the the death of Abel by Cain and the curse in it and I think well that that was the that was a single brother two brothers conflict but but here we have in the sense of Jacob the twelve there was one who was one who's good one who was an able archetype and there were twelve eleven that came after him so that I don't know maybe there's something about the division or no that's a good observation I didn't thought about that yeah well I mean there's a bit of variability because Reuben and Reuben isn't quite as bad as the rest but yeah I would say it's probably easier for the Cain side to multiply luckily it's not as powerful because it doesn't do anything like it yes yes and you know you know there's young was often included accused of manichaean isn't I'm not pronouncing that properly but there was a there was a variant of Christian dogma that held that good and evil were separate metaphysical realities and that they were battling for the for governance of the cosmos something like that but they both had an independent and the classical Christian idea which one out over that was that no that good was real but evil was the absence of good now that produced all sorts of the absence of good produces all sorts of consequences and it is interesting to read young because he does get kind of Manichean in his discussions and I think it was partly because he was so concerned about what happened in Nazi Germany and then with cold war afterwards you know because evil seemed to be a palpable force but I don't think that it's as powerful as good but I do think it's easier for it to multiply because it's what's easier path it's easy to be resentful and hostile and bitter and and do nothing that's easy it's horrible and it's hard on people but it doesn't require a tremendous amount of faith or effort so maybe that is why it's multiplied in the final story in Genesis yeah and I've been reading ahead and for my own based on the interest of the president presented stories and I I keyed in on a few other books and chapters in the Bible like first Corinthians 13 which is the love chapter and that cycles through the idea of I can have all things in life knowledge power but it's all passing and now and forever our hope faith hope and love and and of course love triumphs over all yeah well the love issue see I've been saying I thought a lot about the relationship between love and truth because I've thought and talked a lot more about truth and I think partly that's because love is a word that you can hardly even say because it's been so it's like it's being dragged behind a car through mud puddles it's something like that but so sorry let me just finish it lab rating this idea but I think that the the love idea is associated with for me at least with what I discussed at the beginning of this lecture with regards to faith I think you have to make a decision about what your attitude towards being is going to be and the proper attitude in my estimation is that you're working for its betterment you know and so maybe maybe you have the same attitude towards being as you do towards someone that you love like a son or a daughter or wife that you want things to be better and that so that's your aim so the aim is basically the aim is motivated by love you want things to be better because I think that's a good definition of love like if you really care for someone you can tell because you want things to be better for them and then I think truth is nested inside that because I think that truth is the best servant of love it's something like that so I've been struggling with an idea recently that I was thinking maybe you'd be able to help me out with basically in a recent interview you talked about how myth is meant to reconcile inherent contradictions in reality right but but I'm sort of stuck between two mythological or psychoanalytic ideas that I think are both really important but they seem to have a inherent contradiction within them that I've been trying to figure out so on one hand you have this idea that there's times in your life where you have to identify things in yourself that are insufficient or there's a problem somehow that you have to kind of have a controlled burn or like a Phoenix like transformation where you discard part of yourself that doesn't fit or is not working but then on the other hand you have talked about this this Union idea where as you become really when you get older you mature by reincorporating things about yourself that you lost when you were younger or that you know you're trying to integrate your shadow or you're trying to find parts of your personality that that maybe you've been rejecting and trying to figure out how to bring them into into the folder in the hole so he's got this quote that I really like which is I'd rather behold and good right right so so on one hand you may identify something as a problem and you want to get rid of it or burn it off but then on the other hand it seems like the the path to being stronger is to figure out how to put everything together so there's that there's a one of the things Jung wrote about in his works on alchemy was an explanation of the prime alchemical dictum which was solve a coagula which meant dissolve and integrate right so so imagine this imagine that imagine you had a fairly hostile father who was not very well controlled in his aggression decent person other than that but let's say that and so your reaction is I'm never going to be aggressive and so you've built a like a moral structure that's part of your personality and there's possibility floating around outside of that did you you've denied an ethical you've denied any ethical what would you say you've stripped the idea of aggression of any ethical utility whatsoever okay so what happens this burns off and then that comes back up now you still have to integrate it so it's associated in some sense with Nietzsche's ideas morality as cowardice because one of nature's most trenchant critiques of traditional morality let's say is that most of what passes for morality isn't morality it's just cowardice it's not that I'm a good person and I don't hurt you it's that I'm afraid to hurt you and because I don't want to admit that I'm afraid to hurt you and then I say I'm moral because then I can mask my essential fear and cowardice in a guise of morality and that happens far more often than you would think because harmless and moral are by no means the same thing so some of what you're burning off you can sit and this is where Freud was such a genius I think is because he concentrated on aggression and sexuality which are perhaps the two most difficult parts of a personality to integrate said that the the hyper simp fied morality stops you from tapping into deeper recesses of your psyche and it's partly because there are primal forces it's not surprising that you don't want to have anything to do with them that you stay away from situations where they might make themselves manifest but the problem is by denying the worst in yourself in that manner suppressing it you preclude the possibility of the best because no one can be a good person without integrating their capacity for aggression because without that capacity of a progression you cannot say no because no means if you really say it no means there isn't anything that you can do to me that will make me change my mind or or conversely it means I will play for higher stakes than you will and unless you've got your aggression integrated there isn't a chance you can say that and if you did no one would take you seriously because they'd know it was just a show so one of the most useful things that Jung did I think was to work on this idea of the integration of the shadow because he was really interested in the idea of evil right especially working with trying to parcel out what happened in Nazi Germany and during the Second World War what do you do with the part of you that's aggressive and and potentially malevolent do you just crush it that's the super-ego response in some sense do you just put it behind you so to speak is that a possibility or do you admit to its existence and bring it into the game and that's see for Freud in some sense morality was super-ego clamping down on the it'd and they were fundamentally opposed both young and Piaget had a different idea and I think they were right it's like no no you invite the bad guys out to play and so you're an aggressive hockey player but it's disciplined aggression that makes you gives you access to the whole source of energy you wouldn't otherwise have and then with regards to sexuality it's like well untrammeled promiscuity doesn't constitute a virtue but neither does unavoidable virginity right in fact I think that's worse because it also masks itself with virtue it's like well you should be able to you should be able to do things that you wouldn't do that's that's like the definition of a genuinely moral person they could do it but they don't and that that's not cowardice and so that's you burn off the things that get in the way of that integration so when you say dissolve and integrate it'd be a good way to sort of bring the two ideas together that the burning off and the difficult process is necessary because the elements of yourself are structured together in a rigid way that is not working properly and that's what happens to Geppetto in the belly of the whale he's so caught in his presuppositions that he can't escape right and so Pinocchio represents the new force so it's very interesting so when you watch Pinocchio try to rescue him the first thing Geppetto does is confuse Pinocchio with a fish because he wants something to eat but Pinocchio is better than something to eat because he could rescue him so he doesn't need to eat and then Pinocchio wants to make a fire in Geppetto objects because he's gonna burn up all the furniture it's like we don't need the damn furniture if we're getting out of the whale you know and so so Geppetto and and he's old so that that that's that that's the rigid structure that's the old year that has to die off before the new year can be born it's a forest fire that allows for new growth and and that's how those things are put together and to see and it's useful to know too because if you burn something off you might think well there's nothing left it's like that's not true if it's dead wood then you have room for new growth and you want to be doing that on a fairly regular basis that's the that's that's the snake that sheds its skin and transforms itself right that's that's the death and resurrection from a psychological perspective it's exactly the same idea now we don't know the upper limit to that right because we don't know what a person would be like if they let everything that they could let go let go and only let in what was seemly let's say but you can see that's funny we don't know that to some degree you can see people vary from you can see people start to do that without that's not an rare experience and people improve very rapidly they can improve their lives very rapidly a lot of its low-hanging fruit like if you just stop doing really stupid things that you know are stupid your life improves a lot so and it frees you up it also means there's a there's an element there that's also associated with pride because people tend to take pride in who they are and that's a bad idea because that stops you from becoming who you could be because if you're proud of who you are you won't let that go when it's necessary you won't step away from it you know and then you end up being your own parody something like that that's also a very bad idea you want to be continually stepping away from your previous self and so big and I guess part of that too is that you you have to decide you know are you are you order or you chaos or you the process that mediates between them and if you're the process that mediates between them you you are the thing that transforms and that's the right attitude for human being because that's what we are we're the thing that voluntarily confronts chaos and transforms that's what we are and so for better or worse you know that's our deepest biological essence you might say and so you can let things go if you know that there's more growth to come so one more thank you for your time and thank you for spending time with us hey my pleasure so if I could since we are at the end of Genesis I like the opportunity to challenge or at least have you take another look at your position you've held with regards to Cain's reflection on the murder of evil I bring this up because it's actually a part of Genesis that has bothered me for a while and it's not like because not as straightforward as its presented usually and it's really I've been wrestling with it so in this series as well as in a couple of your maps of meaning lectures you summarized that something to the effect of Cain coming to the conclusion that what he did leads to a punishment which is more than he believes he can face which I believe to be born out of a natural reading of a specific translation choices incorrectly made or enter a innocently made by editors just for readability sake so in Genesis 4:13 Cain does not say my punishment is greater than I can bear he actually says he meets my sin is greater than I can bear which is this a.m."

    "text": "which is to say it's not his past actions we just say it's not his past sections its futures consequences which it's just past action it's not his future consequences which he regrets for him to say our own iniquity or sin that is too much for him to bear as a reflection on the reality of his corruption and not a plea of Mercy to the deity to spare him mmm okay well that's that seems to be a deeper interpretation I would say and I think it's more that's the same line of reasoning that Dostoevsky pursued in crime and punishment right because in crime and punishment Raskolnikov gets away with murder and then he cannot stand it he cannot stand that he did it because he's no longer the same person but even more he cannot stand that he got away with it so that's more in keeping with with that interpretation so this also is reflected in the falling verse and 4:14 where he states the consequences of his actions mainly that God's presence will hot be hidden from him and that he will be killed the verse opens was the word hane which means indeed more or less and to note the sense of acceptance and not a complaint it is the difference between saying oh no well God now hide his face from me and will I be hunted versus of course God will hide his face for me and I will be hunted and killed which I've been wrestling with and I've taken a way to possibly mean that there are sins that we can do that will just push us too far well okay there there there are well okay so one of the well one of the things that you see in post-traumatic post-traumatic stress disorder situations for example is that people view themselves doing something so terrible they don't know how to put it right so that and so you could say under those circumstances the face of God is hidden from them because they cannot they cannot atone for it they can't reconcile themselves to it it's there all the time and they can't see anything good beyond it it's hell essentially and so I mean sometimes when you're working with people with post-traumatic stress disorder you know you you kind of in initiate them into a philosophy of good and evil so that they can see when Joseph talks to his brothers and they've got all this guilt right and and he doesn't want them to have more guilt than necessary to fix themselves because it just burdens them otherwise he says look don't forget yeah yeah it was you but it's also God's doing and I had a client once who who had obsessive-compulsive disorder and he's a very smart guy he also happened to work in a radioactive lab that had a lot of radioactive materials which wasn't the best place for someone with OCD and he was worried that he would make some mistake this is very common with OCD that would result in someone's suffering which you will you'll do that and it wasn't until I could get him to conceptualize himself and his life in part as a force of nature that he was able to reconcile himself to the possibility that an error on his part would produce catastrophic consequences but people often find themselves in situations where they just they cannot reconcile themselves to what they've done and that it makes sense to me that that the interpretation that you're describing that that makes them that makes plenty of sense from a psychological perspective there are sins that will push us like just beyond our limit that are too far but there are also no consequences to our actions that are devoid of a truth we can accept and learn from and this is what I've kind of dealt out of this bit with Cain and Abel so if this is the case why then does it take us so long and with so much self - now before we accept personal responsibility when faced with tragedy especially when it's self inflicted well I I don't think you want to underestimate the contribution of just sheer difficulty like you know let's say you you you you're grieving because someone close to you died it's like well it isn't just that you've lost them although that's a big part of it it's that you have to rebuild yourself and it's really hard to do that so and it is sort of proportional to the significance of your error so if you commit an error and then you recognize that it's an error if it's a sort of surface error it's like well you can just touch up the paint but sometimes the whole under structure is just rotten and then you don't know what to do and then so that's one problems just sheer bloody difficulty and I see this with people very often it's like they're at a point in their divorce let's say and they don't know what to do they cannot solve the problem it's too complicated they just don't have the resources and maybe they've squandered some of their resources as well but sometimes they just don't have the resources and then if you add to that error and sin and malevolence and blindness and all those other things people there's a guy named Thomas SAS who wrote this really interesting article in the 1960s a book actually called the myth of mental illness and it was classic reading for clinical psychologists when I was training and the reason for that was is that SAS pointed out and this is true is that mmm-hmm lots of times if you're a psychotherapist people don't come to you because they have mental illnesses they had come to you because they have insoluble problems in their life you know like maybe they've had a two-year affair at work their wife is alcoholic and they have a very and their father has Alzheimer's disease it's like they just don't know what to do it's too much now you know they shouldn't have had the affair so there's a moral issue and maybe they should have intervened in the alcoholism in the family maybe they used their wives alcoholism as an excuse to have the affair you know like these things get very tangled it's just it's so bloody complicated that people can't untangle it so and I would say that's in keeping with the interpretation that you laid forth with regards to cain is it sounds like that's one of the reasons why it's so useful to read multiple translations right because nuances matter it sounds to me from that description that he actually woke up at least briefly and noticed what he did and said there's no coming back from this and and it is you can easily get places that you do not know how to come back from now you know they say well all things are possible with God and there's always the possibility of redemption no matter how serious the sin but I'll tell you sometimes people have no idea how to get back from where they went well and you can understand often why people wouldn't do that right yeah well that's a funny thing because one of the things Carl Rogers said too about psychotherapy is that you can't do psychotherapy with someone who hasn't recognized that they have a problem so that it's a massive thing to recognize that you have a problem and it does open the door perhaps to recovery but it also means that you've recognized that you have a problem and that can be very very it's the desert right you're out of the tyranny but you're in the desert and the sun's beating down on you and there's no necessary reason to presume that you're going to survive so think you have goodnight and stay thank you all you"

    "text": "[Music] [Music] all right so the last time I was here many of you were as well we got halfway through the story of Jacob and I've been digging underneath the story sporadically since then to try to find out whether other themes are being developed and I've got some things that I think are really interesting to talk about so so we'll get right into it so I'm gonna review a little bit first so we were talking about Jacob and I'll read eight his biography a little bit so that we can place ourselves in the proper context before we go on so his mother Rebecca gave birth to twins and the twins even in her womb were struggling for although they were struggling and of course the story is that they were struggling for dominance the older are the younger against the older really because Jacob Jacob means usurper and Rebecca had a what would you call a vision from God that said that Jacob would supplant Esau and so even before her twins were born they were in a state of competition and that's a recapitulation of the motif of the hostile brothers right it's a very very very common mythological motif and we we already saw that really well developed in the story of Cain and Abel right and Cain and Abel were essentially the first two human beings the first two natural born human beings and they were instantly locked in a state of enmity which is symbolic of first the enmity that exists within people's psyche between the part of them you might say that's aiming at the light and the part of them that's aiming at the darkness and I think that's a reasonable way of portraying it obviously it's a way that sort of rife with symbolism but my experience of people especially when you get to know them seriously or when they're dealing with serious issues is that there is quite clearly a part of them that's striving to do well in the world or even to do good and another part that's deeply sinned and embittered that that says to hell with it and is self-destructive and lashes out and really aims at making things worse and so that seems to be a natural part of the human psyche and that's also reflected in the the idea of the fall and so those ideas are not easily cast away they're associated with the rise of self-consciousness right and in the story of the Garden of Eden and I think that's right because I do think that our self-consciousness produces that division within us because more than any other creature were intensely aware of our finitude and suffering and that tends to turn us at least to some degree against being itself you know I was watching a bunch of protesters in the US last week scream out the sky about Trump you know and it was interesting like I thought it was an extraordinarily narcissistic display but but despite that there was something symbolically appropriate about it I also there's a movie I really like sadly enough called fubar I don't know how many of you have seen that yeah you know that movie I take it yeah it's about the people I grew up with so yeah that's true man I'm telling you that's true so the the guy the main actor in fubar who's quite bright but completely uncivilized gets testicular cancer and there's one great scene where he gets far too drunk and he's stumbling around the street you know in in a virtually comatose state and of course he's not very thrilled with what's happened to him and he's shaking his fist at the sky it's pouring rain and he's cursing God and you know it's like well you can kind of understand his position so that kind of reminded me of these people who were yelling at this guy you know they were basically they were out dramatizing the idea of in rape they were enraged at well you could say god of course most of them wouldn't say that but but they were the ones yelling at the damn sky I mean you know so you got a he got a look at what they're doing rather than what they say and they were outraged that being was constructed such that Trump could have arisen as president and so well so this idea you know that we can be easily turned against being and work for its destruction is a really it's a really common common common theme it never goes away you see it echoed in stories like with the new Marvel series for example you see the enmity between Thor and Loki that's a good example of the same thing or between Batman and the Joker there's there's a Superman and Lex Luthor these there's these pairs of hero against villain that's a really dramatic and easily what everyone can understand that dynamic right it's a basic plot and the reason it's a basic plot is because it's true of the battle within our spirits our own individual spirits it's true within families because sibling rivalry can be unbelievably brutal it's true between human beings who are strangers it's true between groups of people like it's true at every level of analysis and then in some sense it's it's archetypal true at least with regards to deep religious symbolism because you see that echoed in many stories as well so I think the clearest representation is probably Christ and Satan that's the closest to a pure archetype although there's in the old Egyptian stories there's Osiris and Seth or Horus and Seth and Seth is a precursor to Satan etymologically so it's a very very common motif and so that's what happens again in Rebecca's womb is that this thing this idea is played out right away and the two two twins are actually what would you call it there they have a superordinate destiny because one of them is destined to become the father of Israel and of course that's a pinnacle moment in the Old Testament obviously and arguably a pinnacle moment in human history now you know degree to which the stories in the Old Testament actually constitute what we would consider empirical history as a matter of debate but it doesn't matter in some sense because as I mentioned I think before in this lecture series know there are there are forms of fiction that are met a true which means that they're not necessarily about a specific individual although I generally think they are based on the life of specific individuals it's the simplest theory but who knows right but they're they're more real than reality itself because they abstract out the most relevant elements of reality and present them to you and that's why you watch fiction you know you don't you want you want your fiction boiled down right you want to boil down to the essence that's what makes good fiction and that essence is something that's truer than then plain old truth if it's handled well and so you know if you watch a Shakespeare play half a lifetime of events can go by in a Shakespeare play and it covers you know a wide range of scenes and so on and and so it's it's cut and edited and compressed all at once but because of that it blasts you with with a kind of emotional and ethical force that just the mere videotaping of someone's daily life it wouldn't even wouldn't even come close to approximating so then this motif of the hostile brothers that's a that's a deep deep archetypal truth and raychel two nations are in thy womb and two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels and one people shall be stronger than the other and the elder shall serve the younger and so there's a inversion there right because as we've discussed historically speaking and traditionally speaking it's the elder son that to whom the disproportionate blessings flow there's some truth in that too even more what would you say more empirically iq tends to decrease as the number of children in the family increase the younger the old is the smartest generally speaking it isn't clear why that is but it might be that they get more attention and who knows so those of you who are younger can be very unhappy about that fact now Jacob okay so there's another there's another plotline here too because Abraham and and Rebecca are at odds at sorry Isaac and Rebecca are at odds about the children right so there's a there's an eatable twist to it too because well Isaac is allied with Esau who turns out to be the hunter type so he's your basic rough-and-tumble character you know and he's kind of a wild looking guy he'll Harry and he likes to be outside he lives in tents he likes to hunt he's a man's man that's one way of thinking about it whereas Jacob dwells in tents you know he doesn't go outside much he's more well maybe he's more introverted but he's certainly this sort of kid adolescent say who hangs around home and it there's some intimation that he's his mud well he's clearly his mother's favorite and with all the advantages and I suppose disadvantage does go along with that and Isaac and Rebecca don't see eye-to-eye about who should have predominance among the sons and Rebecca is quite complicit with Jacob in inverting the social order so the first thing that happens that's crooked is that Esau comes in from hunting and he's you know maybe he's been out for a number of days and he's ravenous and he's kind of an impulsive guy doesn't really seem to think about the long term very much and Jacob was cooking some lentil stew and Esau I want some of it and Jacob refuses and and then says that he'll trade his his birthright for it and Esau agrees which is a bad deal right it's a bad deal and so you you could say that Esau actually deserves what's coming to him although at minimum you'd have to think of them both as being equally culpable it's a nasty trick and so that's Jacob's first trick and then the second trick is that it's later and Isaac is old and blind and you know close to death and it's time for him to bestow a blessing on his sons which is a very important event apparently among these ancient people and Esau again is out hunting and Rachel dress dress is Jacob up in a hairy it puts a goat skin on his arm so he's kind of hairy like Esau and dresses him and Esau is closed so he smells like he's so and Isaac tells Esau to go out and hunt him up some some venison I think it is and which is a favorite of his and Rebekah has Jacob cook up a couple of goat kids and serve that to Isaac and play the role of Esau and so he does that it's pretty net damn nasty really all things considered you know to play a trick like that both on your brother and on your blind father and the inclusion with your mother it's not the sort of thing that's really designed to promote a lot of familial harmony and so especially because you've already screwed him over in a big way once you know you'd think you'd think that would be sufficient so anyways he's successful and Esau loses his father's blessing and so that Jacob ends up really in the position of the firstborn and it's quite interesting because you know God tells Rachel that Jacob is going to be the dominant twin and you'd think again with God's blessing or at least the prophecy that Jacob would end up being a good guy but he's certainly not presented that way to begin with which is also quite interesting given that he's the eventual founder of Israel and it's another indication of the realism of these old stories you know and it's it's quite amazing to me it's always been quite amazing to me how unpretty fight these stories have remained you know because you'd think that if you're even the least bit sinned especially if you had the kind of Marxist religion is the opiate of the masses kind of viewpoint which which is a credible viewpoint you know although it's wrong but it's correct well I I think it's a shallow I think it's a shallow interpretation and not part of the reason I think it's a shallow interpretation is because the stories would be a lot prettier if that was the case these characters wouldn't have this strange realistic moral ambiguity about them you know if you're gonna feed people a fantasy then it you want it to be like a Harlequin novel or or our greeting card or something like that you don't want it to be a story that's full of betrayal and deceit and murder and mayhem and genocide and all of that if that just doesn't seem all that what would you say calming I guess would be the right right answer so anyways Jacob gets away with this but Esau is not happy and and Jacob is quite convinced that he might kill him and I think that was a reasonable fear because he saw was a tough guy and he was used to being outside and he knew how to hunt and he knew how to kill and he actually wasn't very happy about getting seriously screwed over by his you know stay-at-home younger brother twice and so Jacob runs off and goes to visit his uncle and on the way and this is a very interesting part of this story he stops and to sleep and he takes a stone for a pillow and then he has this vision it's called a dream but the context makes it look like a vision of a ladder reaching up to heaven and with angels moving up and down the the ladder let's say and there's some representations of that I showed you some of them the last time we met but I'll read it to you first he lighted upon a certain place and Ty read there all night because the Sun was set and he took of the stones of that place and put them for his pillows and lay down in that place to sleep and he dreamed and beheld a ladder set up on the earth and the top of it reached to heaven and behold the angels of God ascending and descending on it and behold the Lord stood above it and said I am the Lord God of Abraham thy father and the god of Isaac land whereon thou liest to thee I will give it and to thy seed and thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth and thou shalt spread abroad to the west and to the east and to the north and the south so that lays out the canonical directions right so now there's a center with the canonical directions like the thing that you see you know that little symbol you see on maps it's the same thing that symbolically placed upon the earth so a center has been established with radiating well with with what with with directional lines radiating from it so it establishes as a place and in the end I seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed so that's pretty good news for Jacob and it's not self-evident why God is rewarding him for running away after screwing over his brother but that seems to be what happens and so here's a couple of representations classic representations the one on the right is William Blake is what I particularly like you know and Blake assimilates God with the Sun and with light right so that's quite a common mythological idea that that God is associated with light and the day behold I am with thee and will keep thee in all places whither thou goest and will bring me again into this land for I will not leave thee until I have done that which I have spoken to thee of and Jacob awaked out of his sleep and he said surely the Lord is in this place and I knew it not and he was afraid which is exactly the right response and said how dreadful is this place it is none other than the house of God and this is the gate of heaven and Jacob rose up early in the morning and took the stone that he had put for his pillows and set it up for a pillar and poured oil on the top of it and that's that's a more important thing than you think and we'll go into that a little bit more deeply because up to this point in this story there isn't anything really there isn't anything that's really emerged to mark a sacred space right there's no there's no cathedral there's no Church there's nothing like that but here's this idea that emerges that you can mark the center of something that and that's important and you mark it with a stone and stones a good way to mark things that that are important because the stone is permanent right and we mark things with stones now like we mark graves with stones for example because we want to make a memory and to carve something into stone to carve a stone and then to carve something into stone is to make a memory and to use stone is to make a memory because stone is permanent and to set it up right is to to indicate a center and so that's what happens and pours oil on the top of it which is kind of offering and he called the name of that place Bethel but the name of the city was called Las at the first and Jacob vowed a vow saying if God will be with me and will keep me in this way that I go and will give me bread to eat and raiment to put on then a tenth of what I earned I will give him I missed that that's interesting too because now there's a transformation of sacrifice right because until that point sacrifices have had been pretty concretize dit was the burning of something whereas here all of a sudden it's the offering of of productive labor per se like a tithe because it tithe is a form of sacrifice and so there's an abstraction of the idea of sacrifice no sacrifice it's really important that the idea of sacrifice gets abstracted right because it should be abstracted to the point where it's it's used the way that we use it today which is you know we make sacrifices to get ahead and everyone understands what that means but the sacrifices are generally some combination of psychological and and and practical so we're not acting them out we're precisely we're not dramatizing them at ritualizing and we actually act them out in our in the covenant that we make with the future and we do that well unless we're extraordinarily impulsive and aimless in our lives and have really no conception whatsoever of the future and are likely to sacrifice the future for the present which is it what he saw does right then we make sacrifices and you got to think like the idea of making sacrifices to make the future better is an extraordinarily difficult lesson to learn it took people god only knows how long to learn that you know like we have no idea it's not something that animals do easily chimpanzees don't store leftover meat you know they just and neither do wolves they just a wolf can eat about thirty pounds of meat in one sitting and that's that's where the idea of wolfing it down comes from they're not hiding it saving it for later you know they can't do that so they can't sacrifice the present for the future so this is a big deal that this that this happens now I want to tell you a little bit about the idea of the pillar because it's it's an unbelievably deep idea and it Orient's us in ways that we still don't it's still orienting us in ways that we don't understand and in fact it's actually the mechanism by which we're oriented or and if it's lacking then we become disoriented and so I'll show you some pictures and describe them first okay so first of all there's a walled city so let me tell you that you could think about that as an archetypal human habitation maybe it's a reflection of something like a fire in the middle of the plain or the forest or the jungle for that matter although it's kind of hard to get a fire going there imagine a fire ringed around with logs and perhaps ringed around with dwellings right so the fire is in the center and the fire defines the center and then as you move away from the fire you move out into the darkness right so the fire is light and communion and safety and as you move away from the fire you move out into the darkness and what's terrifying out beyond the perimeter so what's beyond the perimeter is terrifying you can feel that if you go camping somewhere that's wild you know you're pretty damn happy especially if the wolves are howling you're pretty damn happy to be sitting by the fire because you can see there the fire keeps the animals away and you know if you do wander into the bush into the darkness then you're on alert and you know you're predator detection systems are on alert and so you could think about the classical human habitation as two places one where your predator detection system isn't on alert another where your predator textured detection system is alert on alert and you could think about that roughly as the distinction between explored territory and unexplored territory and really the the founding of a place is precisely this is a lot of this I got from reading your chair le ah de the founding of a place is precisely the definition of a explored center set against the unexplored periphery and you know what's interesting about that so you can kind of think about that with regards to the walled city right everything in the wall is cosmos and everything outside the wall is chaos and you know but it also extends to the conceptual realm because imagine that you're the master of a field of study and so that's an interesting metaphor because a field is a geographical metaphor right and if in the center of the field are those things that everyone knows really well the axioms that everyone abides by in the field and then as you move towards the fringes you get to work towards the unknown towards the frontier of the discipline and as you become expert you move from the center to the frontier and so then you're on the border when you're when you're when you're a scholar a competent school you're on the border between the unexplored or the explored and unexplored and you're trying to further that border so even if you're just doing this abstractly it's the same thing and it's a reflection of the fact that every human environment concrete or abstract it makes no difference recapitulates the cosmos chaos dichotomy or the order chaos dichotomy and that's why in Taoism for example it's the union of chaos and order that constitutes being itself and that you stand on the border between chaos and order because that's the proper place to be to orderly to much in the explored you're not learning anything too much out there where the Predators lurk then you're frozen with terror and neither of those positions are desirable so and that's what you know and so you think and this is a concur reality obviously as well as a psychological reality there were reasons for those walls right because inside the walls where all the people like us and so that begs the question what does it mean for people to be like us and then outside the wall there rose all those people because they were the worst forms of predators because people are actually the worst forms of predators who aren't like us and the wall is there to draw a distinction between like us and not like us and so and that was a matter of life and death if you can tell that because I mean look at those walls they had to build those by hand and you know you do see walled cities that have three rings of walls so these people were terrified but not so terrified as the people who built three walls they were really terrified and they had their reasons so okay so now there's an idea that's that's reflected in the Jacob's Ladder story that the center where you put the pillar is also the place where heaven and earth touch and so that's that's a complicated idea I think that you can you know I'm trying to look at these stories from a psychological perspective and so then you could say that that's a symbolic place where the lowest and the highest come together and so it's a place where earthly being stretches up to the highest possible ethical abstraction and that's the center because one of the things that defines us say as opposed to them is that we're all united within a certain ethic that's what makes us the same this is a complicated line of reasoning and but I'll go back to it after I show you some more pictures but so that's that's the first idea is that the center is the place where the lowest and the highest touch simultaneously and so you could say that in some sense it specifies the aim of a group of people that's another way you know if you get together with people make a group even at work you group yourself around a project and that unites you and it unites you because you all have the same aim you're all pointing to the same thing and that makes you the same in some ways because if you're after the same thing I am then the same things are going to be important to you that are important to me and the same things are going to be negative to you that are negative to me because our emotions work out that way and that means I can instantly predict you I know how you're going to behave and so our aim which is basically our ethical aim it's because we're aiming at something better at least in principle we're aiming at something better so our ethical aim that unites our perceptions and that's what aligns our emotions and so that sort of begs the question if you're going to build a community around what aim should the community congregate okay so the idea here is that the center of the community is the pillar that unites heaven and earth so it unites the lowest with the highest so there's some intimation of the idea that it's the highest that unites the community okay and so keep that in mind and that's a very old idea as well that's the idea of the axis mundi which is the center pole that unites heaven and earth it's an unbelievably old idea tens of thousands of years old it might even stretch back to whatever our archaic memories quasi memories I don't know how what you would describe them archetypal memories of our excessively old ancestry and trees when the tree itself was in fact the center of the world and that it was ringed by snakes and chaos and so well we have no idea how old these ideas are but they're very very old and evolution is a conservative business once it builds a gadget then it builds new things on top of that gadgets like a medieval town right the center of the town is really old and new newer areas of the town get built around it but the center is still really old and that's what we're like you know our platforms like our our basic physiological structure this this skeletal body is some tens of millions of years old or older than that if you think about vertebrates it's much older than that and that's all conserved so everything's built on top of everything else alright so there there's a kind of a classic town and there's the idea I showed you this is Scandinavian World Tree same idea at unites heaven and earth and around the roots of that tree are snakes that eat this tree constantly so that's the idea that there's stability but there's constant transformation around that stability and at the same time the snakes are knowing in the roots there's streams that are nourishing it so it's sort of it's sort of an echo of the idea that life depends on death and renewal constantly because your cells are dying and being renewed constantly right if they are just proliferating then you have cancer if they're just dying then you die it you have to get the balance between death and life exactly right so that you can actually live which is also a very strange thing so and that tree is something that reaches from the bottom layers of being maybe the microcosm all the way to the macrocosm that's the idea anyways so then there's okay so there's there's Jacob and his and his pillar he's got this idea that you can mark the center with this stone like it sort of symbolizes what he was laying on when he dreamt but now he's got this idea you put something erect and it marks the center and it symbolizes his vision of the highest good something like that and the promise that's been made to him and then this is an Egyptian obelisk the pyramid on top of it that's in Paris it was taken from Luxor and it put in Paris and so that's a much more sophisticated instance of the same idea okay and there was a Stone Age cultures across Eurasia that put up these huge obelisks everywhere these huge like the Stonehenge is a good example of that although it's it's very sophisticated and there are also markers of places we don't know exactly what their function is but they're very much akin to this some permanent marker of place there's a good one so that's in st."

    "text": "Peter's Basilica in Rome which is an absolutely unbelievable place it's just jaw-dropping and so there's the Cathedral at the back of it and then there's this circle of pillars that surrounds it you can just see them a little bit on on the middle left there that goes all the way around that entire enclosure and you know very large number of people can gather there and then so that pillar marks the center and that would be the center of Catholicism essentially that's what that represents right the the symbolic center of Catholicism although you could make the case that the cathedral is the center it doesn't really matter they're very close together and it's it's half a dozen of one and six or the other and then here's another representation of the same idea right is that this is why people don't like the flag to be burned you know because conservative people see the flag as the sacred thing that binds people together and so they're not happy when that sacred thing is destroyed even if it's destroyed in the name of protest whereas the people who burn flags think well there are times to dramatize the idea that the center has been corrupt and you can demonstrate that by putting it to the torch you know as a representation that that this that the corrupt center now has to be burned and transformed and the thing is they're both right they're both right all the time because the center is absolutely necessary and is sacred and is almost always also corrupt and in need of reparation that's also an archetypal idea and and that's a useful thing to know because you know it it's easy for young people in particular to think that well the world's going to hell in a handbasket and it's the pot fault of the last generation they've left us this terrible mess and you know we've feeling pretty betrayed about that and now we have to clean it up it's like yeah yeah people have been thinking that for like thirty five thousand years it's not new and the reason it's not new is because it's always true you know what you're handed is a sacred center with flaws always always that's partly because it's the creation of the dead right and the dead can't see and they can't communicate and so they're not in touch with the present and so what they've bequeathed to you apart from the fact that it might actually be corrupt which is a slightly different thing is at least blind in dead and so what the hell can you expect from something that's blind and dead you know you're lucky if it just doesn't stomp you out of existence so so that's a lovely photograph obviously and that's the establishment of a new centre then the the centre can be a cathedral too and often is of course in in classic towns European towns in particular although it's not only European towns that are like this there there's a center that's made out of stone so that would be the Cathedral and it's got the highest tower on on top of the tower there's often a cross and that's the symbolic centre so people are are drawn together around whatever the cross represents now that the cross obviously represents a center because it's an X right x marks the spot so the centre of the cross is the center and then the Cathedral is often in a cross shape which also marks the center and then in the cathedral there's a dome often and that's the sky and that's that ladder that reaches from earth to heaven so it's a recapitulation of the same idea so and people are drawn to that Center and the centre is the symbol of what unites them and what unites them is the faith that the cathedral is the embodiment of and you think well what does the faith mean and again we're approaching this psychologically and what it means is that we everyone who's a member of that group accepts the transcendent ideal of the group now the thing is if you're the member of a group you accept the transcendent ideal of the group that's what it means to be a member of a group so if you're in a work team and you're all working on a project what you've essentially done is decided that you're going to make the goal unquestionable right I mean you might argue about the details but if are tasked with something you know here's a job for you ten people organize yourself around the job you can argue about how you're going to do the job but you can't argue about the job then the group falls apart and so there's an act of faith in some sense the reason that the act of faith is necessary is because it's very very difficult to specify without error what that central aim should be given that there's any number of aims right and it's a very very difficult thing to figure out and this is something we're gonna do a little bit tonight is like what should the aim be around which a group would congregate you know that so so especially if it's a large group and it's a large group that has to stay together across very large swathes of time and the group is incredibly diverse you know what possible kind of ideal could unite a large group of diverse people across a very large stretch of time that's a really really hard question and I think part of the way that question has been answered is it's been answered symbolically and in images because it's so damn complicated that it's almost impossible to articulate so but obviously you need to have a center around which everyone can unite because if you don't then everyone's at odds with one another like if I don't know what you're up to and you don't know what he's up to we have no we're just strangers and we don't know that our ethics match at all then the probability that we're going to be able to exist harmoniously decreases rapidly to zero and that's obviously just no good that's a state of total chaos so we can't have that it's it's not possible to exist without a central ideal it's not possible and it's deeper than that it's deeper than that partly because it's I don't know I'll try to get this right this is the sort of thing that I was arguing with sam harris about you see your category system is a product of your aims that's the thing like if you have a set of facts at hand the facts don't tell you how to categorize the facts because there's too damn many facts there's a trillion facts and there's no way without imposing some ape I already order on them of determining how it is that you should order them so how do you order them well that's easy you decide what you're aiming at now how do you do that well I'm not answering that question at the moment I'm just saying that in order to organize those facts you need a name and then the aim instantly organizes the facts into those things relevant to the aim tools let's say those things that get in the way and a very large number of things that you don't have to pay attention to at all right it excludes Verte like if you're working on an engineering problem you don't have to worry about practicing medicine in your neighborhood you don't there's a bunch of like if you're focusing on a particular what would you say any any job any any set of skills implies that you're good at a small set of things and then not good at an incredibly large number of other skills it simplifies things and so you can use your aim as the basis of a category structure and so you also have to keep that in mind because what it means is as far as I can tell that what it means is that your category system itself which is what structures your perceptions is actually dependent on the ethics of your aim it's directly it's a moral thing it's directly dependent on your aim and that's a stunning idea if it happens to be true it's not how people think about thinking we don't think that way we like we think that we think deterministically let's say or that we think empirically or that we think rationally and none of that appears to be the case what we do is we pause it a valid aim and then we organize the world around the aim and there's plenty of evidence from that in in in psychological studies of perception right that that does look like how the the perceptual systems work mostly they ignore because the world is too complicated they focus on a small set of phenomena deemed relevant to whatever the aim is and then of course the aim is problematic again it's complex because the aim I have has to be a name that some of you at or at least don't object to because otherwise I'm not gonna get anywhere with my damn aim it has to actually be implementable in the world it has to be sustainable across at least some amount of time it can't kill me like it's really hedged in this aim it's it isn't any old thing there's hardly any things that it can be so you know Jacob's aim for example in undermining Esau almost gets him killed and you can understand why that's the other thing you think well that that was a nasty bit of work you can understand Esau's rage it's even though we're separated from the people in these stories by what four thousand years three thousand years something like that you know in immediately why everyone feels the way they do at least once you understand the context of the story that none of that's mysterious in the least so so there's the church and the church is underneath the cross right and so that's st."

    "text": "Peter's Basilica and so there's the cross on the globe on top of the Basilica and then there's the cross on the obelisk as well and so what that means is that and this is where things get insanely complicated is that the center is defined by whatever the cross represents now the cross represents a crossing point geographically it's it's certainly that the cross probably represents the body to some degree but then the cross also represents the place of suffering obviously and more importantly it represents the place of voluntary suffering transcended I'm speaking psychologically right not theologically that's what it represents and so you might say so here's the idea behind putting down the obelisk with the cross and saying that that's the center so that's the thing that everyone's aiming at and so the the idea would be well if you're going to be a member of the group defined by this obelisk then what you do is accept your position at the center of suffering voluntarily and therefore transcend it that's the idea and that is one hell of an idea it really is man that is a killer idea because it's actually a signal it's a really clear signal of psychological health you know because one of the things you do if you're a clinical psychologist and someone is paralyzed by fear is what you do is you break their fears down into relatively manageable bits and then you have them voluntarily confront their fears and it might also be things that they're disgusted by it's a if they have obsessive compulsive disorder but it produces very strong negative emotion whatever it is and then you have them voluntarily confront whatever it is that produces that overwhelming negative emotion and that makes them stronger that's what happens it doesn't make them less afraid it makes them more courageous and stronger and that is not the same thing it's seriously not it doesn't decrease the fear it increases the courage and so that's a mind-boggling idea and it's deeper you know one of the things that's really interesting about these archetypal ideas is that and maybe it's partly because of the hyperlink nature of the Bible that's part of it but it's not the whole thing is that no matter how deep you dig into them you'll never get to the bottom you know you hit a bottom you think god that's so unbelievably profound and then if you excavate a little underneath that you find something else that's even more profound and you think wow that's got to be the bottom and then you dig under that's like there's no bottom you can just keep digging down well as far as I can tell you can keep digging down layer after layer and we'll talk a little bit about more a little more about what the cross signifies as the center because you see what people were trying to figure out is what is it that we need to unite under right what's the proper thing to unite under I can give you another example so in the Mesopotamian societies the Emperor you know who was more or less an an absolute monarch he lived inside what was essentially a walled city and the god of the Mesopotamians was mardik and Marduk was the figure who had eyes all the way around his head and he spoke magic words who is very attentive and very articulate and it was Marduk who went out and confronted the goddess of chaos the dragon of chaos and cut her into pieces and made up the world okay so you can kind of understand what that means so mardik goes beyond the frontier into the place of predatory chaos and encounters the thing that's terrifying and then make something productive out of it so it's a hero myth and an mardik is elected to the position of preeminent God by all the other Mesopotamian gods because he manages that so the the mardik idea emerges up the Holy dominance hierarchy and hits the pinnacle so that and god only knows how long that took it would be the amalgamation of many tribes and then that the what the the distillation of all the tribal myths to produce this emergent story of what constitutes Tok God and then the job of the Emperor was to act out Marduk that's what gave him sovereignty so the reason that he was the center around which people organized themselves wasn't because he was when he was being a proper Emperor it wasn't because there was something super special about him like the power didn't exactly reside in him which is a really useful thing to separate right you want the power which is why it's kind of nice to have a symbolic monarch you get the symbolic power separated from the personality power right because otherwise they get conflated that's what happened in Rome it's a very you know you can see it tending to happen now and then in the u.s."

    "text": "like with the Kennedy dynasty's and that sort of thing so the idea was the Emperor had sovereignty as long as he was acting out Marduk properly and going out into the chaos and cutting it into pieces and making order that was his job so they used to take him outside the city on the new year's festival and strip him of all his Emperor garments and humiliate him and then force him to to confess all the ways that year he hadn't been a good Marduk so he wasn't a good ruler and so that was supposed to clue him in and wake him up right and then they would ritually reenact the Battle of Marduk against time out the chaos monster using statues and then if that all went well then the Emperor would go back in and the city would be renewed for another year and we still have echoes of that in our New Year's celebration right it's the same idea that's echoed down all those all those centuries thousands of years so it says such a staggeringly brilliant idea right because so part of the idea is that the thing that's sovereign so that's the pillar at the center that that everyone gathers around is at least in part the thing that courageously goes out into the unknown and make something useful out out of it for the community so that's very very smart it's very smart so this is another example of a center so these this is the flag this is the Union Jack and so it's made up of a bunch of crosses right and so the first cross the English cross that's the flag of st."

    "text": "Patrick - so he banishes the snakes after a 40-day fast and so that's an allusion to the 40 years that Moses spends in the desert and also the 40 days that Christ fasts in the New Testament and his walking stick when he plants it grows into a tree so that echoes all of this ideas about the center that we just described and he also speaks with the ancient Irish ancestors which if you remember is a characteristic of the shamanic rituals where we're so in the typical shamanic ritual which seems to be elicited by psychedelic use the shaman dissolved down past their bones and then they go up into heaven and speak with the ancestors and then they're introduced into the heavenly kingdom and then the flesh is put back on their bones and they come back and tell everybody what happened and that's a repeatable experience right the shamanic tradition is unbelievably widespread so all over Europe ancient Europe and Asia and perhaps as far down as South America right it's highly conserved and it's out of that tradition in all likelihood that our religious city Asian emerged so and you can see echoes of that here so so back to the story of Jacob and his ladder so that I can come again to my father's house in peace then shall the Lord be my god and this stone which I have set for a pillar shall be God's house and of all that that thou shalt give me I will surely give the tenth unto thee so that's that's also an echo I would say of the obligation of those who climb the power higher hierarchy to attend to those who are at the bottom right because if you think about the tithing as a form of wealth distribution which is essentially what it is the part of the ethic that defines the proper moral endeavor that's related to that Center is not to advance yourself at the expense of the entire community so if you're if you're fortunate enough so that you can rise in in authority and power and competence within the confines of a community you still have a obligation to maintain the structure maintain and further the structure of the community within which you rose now that's obvious right because if people didn't do that after a couple of generations the whole thing would fall apart so you know you you you it's it's not reasonable to destroy the game that you're winning it's reasonable to strengthen the game that you're winning and so that's another thing that also describes the ethic that should allow you to be an active member of the community around which that that gathers around that Center so so so one of the things I've learned about the hero mythology that I really really like is so you see this pretty clearly in the figure of Christ but because two things are conjoined in that story but Christ is also the here there's two kinds of heroes say there's the hero that goes out into chaos and confronts the dragon of chaos and gathers the the treasure as a consequence and then shares it with the community that's that's that's one the other form of hero is the hero who stands up against the corrupt state and rattles the foundation of the state has it collapse and then reconstructs it right so because the two great dangers to human beings are unprotected exposure to the catastrophes of the natural world and subjugation to tyranny right those are the two major dangers and so a hero is their ultimate hero is the person who reconstructs the structure of the state by using the information that he gathered by going out into the unknown that unites them both and so what that means here's that here's the rub as far as I can tell so a structure a center has two risks associated with it one is that it will degenerate into chaos and the other is that we'll rigidify into tyranny and it'll degenerate into chaos even if it just stays doing what it's doing so if it just does exactly what it's doing and it doesn't change it will degenerate because things change and if it doesn't change to keep up then it gets farther and farther away from the environment and it'll precipitously collapse and so and then if it just changes willy-nilly so that nobody can establish a stable centralized a game then it degenerates into chaos immediately and no one can get along so there's a rule for being longing to the community and the rule has to be that you have to act in a manner that sustains and that sustains the community and increases its competence that's the fundamental moral obligation for belonging and well and obviously soul right because why would you belong to a why would you walk into a clubhouse that was on fire like that's just not smart right if you're gonna be part of the game if you've decided that being part of the game is worthwhile you've also taken on the moral you've also decided even if you didn't notice it that you have to work to support that game because by deciding to play that game you've said that it's valuable and if it's valuable then obviously you should work to sustain and expand it because that's the definition of having a relationship with something that's valuable and so that's the criteria for membership in the community and that's partly why if you regard the cross say as the symbol of voluntary suffering you know suffering accept it voluntarily something like that which is means that there's another element of that too that's worth thinking about so you know the reason that cane gets so out of hand is because he's suffering and he won't accept it he certainly won't accept responsibility for it he's angry and bitter about it and no wonder right I mean we have to be realistic about these sorts of things there you guys all of you people are gonna suffer at some point in your life to the point where you're angry and bitter about it I mean there's just absolutely no doubt about that and you're even gonna think well it's no bloody wonder that I'm angry and bitter about it everyone would be and things are so god-awful that there's no excuse for them to even exist and like that's a powerful argument although I think it's ultimately self-defeating well that's kind of what the story of Cain and Abel that's kind of what the story of Cain and Abel what would you say that's the moral of the story of Cain and Abel essentially so what that means instead is that even under those conditions of relatively intense suffering you have to accept it voluntarily because otherwise it turns you against being and then you start to act in this terrible manner that makes everything worse and it seems to me that there's a contradiction in that if if the reason you're complaining that things are bad then it isn't reasonable for you to act in a manner that makes them worse right I mean even if it's no wonder that people do that but it's it's a degenerating game and so that's so the the idea part of the idea of the cross and the suffering that it represents is that if you can accept that voluntarily regardless of its intensity then you won't become embittered and resentful and vengeful to the point where you pose a danger to the stability of the community so or to your own stability for that matter cuz it's you know it might be your own stability the stability of your family the stability of the community and the stability of the world it might be all of that and increasingly I think it is all of that so okay so now Jacob we get the second part of Jacob story he goes to meet his uncle Lebon and he meets Rachel there again by oh well he falls in love and goes to live with levan there are two daughters there Leah as well as Rachel Leah is not a particularly attractive person it isn't exactly clear why but the story makes it quite clear she's definitely the least desirable of the two daughters and the story makes reference to her eyes and it isn't clear if there's something wrong with her physiologically or if there's something wrong with her attitude it's not obvious but doesn't really matter the point is she's the older daughter but she's the less desirable one Jacob stays a month which is the limit of hospitality in in that time if you stayed for a month you were welcome but you had to work for your keep I think after about three days something like that which seems rather reasonable and so he stays a month and then he has a chat with Lebon and he says he's fallen in love with Rachel by this time and he says I'll stay with you and work for seven years and then all weird Rachel if and the band says that's a fine deal and then the seven years passes and there's a wedding ceremony it's quite a long thing and the bride is veiled and the bride goes into the tent with with Jacob and if I remember the story correctly I haven't looked at it for a month or so rachel is outside the tent speaking but leah is inside the tent and so Jacob thinks he's getting married to Rachel but he's actually getting married to Leah and this is it's an inversion a because he's in the dark like Isaac was when he fooled Isaac so now it's Jacob's turn to be in the dark and he gets betrayed by his uncle and his bride-to-be Rachel and her sister in a manner that's broadly parallel to the trick that he pulled on Esau and so there's a karma notion there which I which I'd like you know I mean you might think of karma as a superstitious idea but and there are ways of interpreting it that might make it the case but I don't think that's what it is it's that no bad deed goes unpunished it's something like that it's like you know maybe you've done something bad to someone and therefore there's part of you that feels quite guilty about that hopefully and that part is looking for punishment to set the stage right and you might think well no but things are yes unless you're a psychopath that's how things work if you're interested in that kind of thing you should read Dostoyevsky's Crime and Punishment because it's the definitive study of that sort of phenomena right because in that book the main protagonist Raskolnikov gets away with murder like he does it successfully no one suspects him and he drives himself so crazy with guilt that he basically falls into the hands of the police he drives himself into the hands of the police because he can't tolerate what he did it's very it's amazing it's amazing book but anyways the point is he Jakub falls prey to the same sort of crookedness that he used to ratchet himself up the ladder and that happens far more often in life and people think and it's really not like he can complain about it right not if he has any sense it's like he does he brings Leah out to see Lebon and he says what's what's with this sister you know and Lebon basically says to him in our culture it's the custom to marry the eldest daughter first which is exactly right and he said well it would bring you know he's rationalizing obviously because he's just screwed over Jacob in a major way but it's a little late to take it back that the marriage has been consummated and the ceremony has been complete and all hell would break out if there was any attempt to sever the relationship so that's how it is so Leah's married and Jacob has the wrong wife so then so this is Jacob there you see on the left he's got the little flowery hat and he's pointing to Leah and he's saying like what what's up here and love the band you know Laband 'is tough old goat and he's not really all that sad about it in fact you can imagine that he's kinda good so so okay then he has to work another seven years and he gains rachel but because god is a tricky character there's another twist in this story Rachel turns out not to be very good at having children or Rachel and Jacob turn out not to be very good at having children but Leah she's really good at having kids so she provides Jacob with Reuben Simeon Levi or let's leave I believe and Judah and the names of those meanings of those names are there Reuben means see a son Simeon means hearing though I think that was the Lord heard my prayer I think that's what that was Levi means joined Judah means praise to yahwah and it's Judah from whose tribe Christ arises Judah is essentially promoted to the status of firstborn later in the story this is important because Reuben Simeon and Levy all do something reprehensible and so Judah gets gets promoted to firstborn and that's partly why in the logic of this narrative that it's from the tribe of Judah that Christ arises so so now while this is going on Rachel is like suicidally desperate for children she's jealous of her older sister who's rather ill-favored as we pointed out but who seems to be damn good at producing sons and she's really not happy with Jacob and so she choose him out and Jacob basically says like what do you want me to do about it I'm not God which is a reasonable response I would say and so in her desperation she gives Jacob illa who's her maidservant we've seen that sort of thing happened before and - Billa produces two children Dan and Neff Kelly the reason I'm detailing out all these sons it's Gordon because Jacob is the founder of Israel and his sons are the founder of the 12 tribes so it's a pivotal moment in the story right it's it's because he's that he's the fundamental patriarch of of those who wrestle with God because as we'll see that's what the name Israel means he gets the name Israel you'll see why in a while but but it's you need to know these genealogies in this situation because they play an important role in everything that happens afterwards so Naphtali is the second and her name or his name means with great wrestling's I have wrestled with my sister right contended with her and have prevailed so that gives you some indication of the tension in the household now leah is now past bearing children she gives Jake Jacob her maidservant to Zilpah to keep up with her sister I guess and now Zilpah bares to children for Jacob so he's piling up the kids left right and center here one of them is named gad good fortune and the other is named Asher happy or blessed so there's more rivalry going on between the sisters this is quite an interesting little story so Reuben who's Lea's daughter goes out and looks for Mandrake's now Mandrake's have aphrodisiac property so that's a little odd to begin with but it doesn't matter that's what happens and Rachel is Rachel wants the Mandrake's because she's still interested in having some children and so she bargains with Leah to give her a night with Jacob in exchange for the Mandrake's and more sons emerge as a consequence of that so then Rachel finally gives birth Joseph and Joseph plays a key role in the last story in Genesis which I hope we'll get to in the next lecture and then we can close off Genesis that's the plan anyways so now Jacob isn't really very happy about the whole arrangement because he he's been there 14 years and he's got two wives it's not too bad but he you know he got he the bargain wasn't exactly clean he doesn't really trust la Bannon and there's no reason for him to do so levan was poor before Jacob came Jacob turns out to be a very useful person to have around and so he tells Lebon he wants to leave and go back to his home country and that he'll take the speckled and spotted cattle the brown sheep and the spotted and speckled goats from the flock and they're in the minority so that's the idea and sola ban or lab and takes all those animals out of his flock so there was an idea that the speckled goats and the brown sheep would breed true so if you have two male goat and a female goat and they're both speckled they'll have speckled kids that's the theory and the same with brown sheep and so what Lebon does is he takes all the speckled animals out of the flocks gives them to his son and they go three days away with them so that Jacob is left with the flock but with no with none of these animals now the idea was that all the what newborns were going to be his and so what Lebon is basically done is set it up so that in principle Jacob is going to get nothing for his work so that's another time when Jacob experiences betrayal you know it's almost as if God isn't done with reminding him of the magnitude of what he did in the past that that's the moral of the story in some sense now there's a weird little twist in the story here so what Jacob does is some sympathetic magic and so when the animals are rutting he puts speckled objects in front of them speckled branches and so forth I guess to remind them about what they're supposed to be producing something like that and it works and so all these animals that Lebon left are are producing spotted animals like mad and so that's I guess God's changed his mind and let Jacob off the hook slightly here so soon he was very wealthy much cattle maidservants men servants camels analysis Laban's son sons become jealous and Lebon is outraged well you know obviously there's some competition there between Jacob and the sons which is hardly surprising and the blonde played this trick to strip Jacob of all his property and instead he got far more than he was going to get to begin with so you can imagine that's been a bit annoying so Jacob thinks he better get out of there so he tells Rachel and Leah and said unto them I see your father's countenance that is not toward me as before but the god of my father has been with me and you know with all my power I've served your father and your father has deceived me and changed my wages ten times but God so far has suffered him not to hurt me if he said thus the speckled shall be thy wages then all the cattle bore speckled and if he said thus the ringstraked shall be thy hire then all the cattle bore ringstraked thus God has taken away the cattle of your father and given them to me and they decide to sneak away and they're unhappy with the inheritance lack of inheritance from the man so as they sneak away Rachel steals the idols that her father has in his house and it's not exactly obvious why there's a lot of contention about why she's doing that some of them is to punish him to bring with her the images of her ancestors you know maybe she's lonesome moving away from home just out of spite to show him that the idols were actually powerless for protection to stop her father from divining the route of their escape that last one is the strangest one because the idea would be that Lebon would have used some sort of ritual with the idols that would help him infer their escape route and then could chase them so anyways that's the range of speculation about that I think it sounds to me mostly like a little act of revenge maybe with a bit of loneliness mixed in Laband pursues them but God comes in a dream to tell him to leave Jacob unharmed hmm LaVon catches up with him and reproaches Jacob saying that he would have thrown a great party if he would have known that they were going to leave you know he didn't want them to sneak away in the night and you can't tell from the story whether that's true or not and you know these people were pretty rough and pulse of I would say and maybe there was a 50% chance of a slaughter and a 50% chance of a party who knows I've been to parties like that actually so Laband complains that his gods are gone and Jacob says that whoever has them he will have them killed and Rachel who's really quite a sneaky character all things consider basically claims that she's having her period and she's sitting on the carpet with all the idols underneath and she can't move and so they search everywhere and can't find them and she's like laughing away behind her hand about that sneaky little maneuver but she doesn't die so that's probably a good thing so the ban checks everything out checks the camp out and he can't find anything so they reconcile and so that's the first reconciliation that Jacob engages in it's sort of like the what would you say the karmic dad is being paid that's one way of thinking about it that's so he got punished for his wrongdoing he's learned his lesson perhaps and it's it's that's good enough as far as he's concerned you know he got away good enough and they make peace so then the next thing that happens as they're travelling is that Jacob was left alone and there wrestled a man man angel God it's not clear we'll go with angel with them until the breaking of the day or God and when he saw that he prevailed not against him he touched the hollow of his thigh and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was out of joint as he wrestled with him and he said let me go for the day breaks and Jacob said I will not let you go unless you bless me and the angel said unto him what is thy name and Jacob said Jacob and the angel said thy name shall no more be called Jacob so the supplanter right the the overthrow ur with that kind of intonation of or implication of crookedness but Israel which means Hui who wrestles or strives successfully with God for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men and has prevailed that's quite a story I like it's it's I don't know I don't know exactly what to make of it there's obviously a symbolic level of meaning which is that that is what human beings do in some sense is they they wrestle I would say they wrestle with the divine even with the concept of the divine for that matter and but the question is do they prevail like it's got an odd thing that Jacob actually seems to win this battle right or at least he wins it enough so that whoever he's wrestling this divine figure that he's wrestling is willing to bestow a blessing on him I guess maybe that's a testament to his courage it's something like that maybe it's an indication that he has paid for his sins sufficiently so that he's sort of back on the moral high ground but but I think it's really telling that the transformation of the name from Jacob to Israel and that what Israel means is he who wrestles with God or who struggles with God and perhaps successfully but it's also so interesting that he actually emerges victorious you know you wouldn't necessarily think that that would be a possibility especially given you know God's rather hot-headed nature in the Old Testament you don't wanna mess with him too much but but Jacob does it successfully but even more importantly is the idea that whatever Israel constitutes which would be to say the land that Jacob founds is actually composed of those who wrestle with God I think that's an amazing idea because it also seems to me to shed some light on perhaps what was meant by belief in those days you know like I've often thought of Rett of marriage as a wrestling match right if you're lucky the person that you marry is someone you contend with it's not exactly I don't think it's exactly it's not tranquil precisely you know you might have noticed that some of you and but but the thing is if you have something to contend against then that strengthens you and and that's actually better than having nothing to contend against and so Jakob is the person who's also strengthened by the necessity of this contending and that seems to be the proper relationship with God or the angel is that contending the battling right rather than some sort of kind of loose weak statement of belief I mean I'm not trying to denigrate that to any great degree it just doesn't seem like the right mode of conceptualization right because human beings are aren't like that were contentious creatures and that's actually seems to be something that meets with God's favor in this situation so especially given that that's actually what he names the well the whole kingdom of the chosen people is the idea is that that's composed of those who contend with God so that's that's a hell of an idea that that's for sure and Jacob asked him and said tell me I pray thee thy name and he said wherefore is it thou dost ask after my name so there's no that's not happening and he blessed him there and Jacob called the place of the name of the place Peniel for I or penny'll for I've seen God face to face and my life is preserved and he passed over Peniel the Sun rose upon him and he halted upon his thigh now Jacob does walk away it injured from this right so he has a permanent limp after that and so that's also an indication of just how dangerous that contention actually is like he gets blast he wins but he doesn't get away scot-free and so now so Jacob goes back to Esau and he's terrified even though it's been 14 years he thinks maybe his heart headed brother hasn't calmed down yet and he has good reason to think that I would say so he sends messengers to Esau who then sets out with 400 men and so Jacob is not very happy with this whole idea and he breaks his people into two bands so that maybe half of them cannot be killed and then he takes from his large flocks a bunch of animals and a bunch of servants and he sends them out to meet he saw basically to say look I'm I'm I'm a jerk and sorry about the whole birthright thing and and here's some animals and you know maybe maybe that's the beginnings of an apology it's something like that and so but he's not very convinced that that's actually going to work but he saw who actually turns out to perhaps have matured in the interim perhaps that's one way of thinking about it meets Jacob and says that just seeing him is enough but Jacob insists that he takes the gift and Esau accepts and which is probably a wise thing because even if he saw is 95% convinced that just seeing his brother is enough there's probably 5% of him that's still really not all that happy and so you have to be careful you know when you say that you forgive someone because there might be a part of you that really doesn't that really needs something else before you can actually say okay look fine you know and you don't want to fool yourself about that because that 5% that hasn't been completely convinced will find its voice at some point and then maybe undermine the whole reconciliation process you don't want to think that you're any better than you are or any nicer than you are it's not helpful and so he saw a smart I think so while Jacob smart to say no no like thanks a lot but take the damn goats and Jacob and Esau is smart enough to accept that and he might do that maybe - you know - please Jacob but also I think so that there really is the possibility of establishing peace because hypothetically the gift that's being offered is of sufficient magnitude to erase the debt of the loss of the birthright it's something like that right it's it's it's it's it's the payment of the real debt and Esau said what meanest thou by all this drove which I met and Jacob said these are to find grace in the sight of my Lord and Esau says I have enough brother keep thou keep that that thou hast unto thyself and Jacob said and this is interesting statement I think no I pray you if if I have now found grace in thy sight take the present at my hand for therefore I have seen thy face as though I had seen the face of God and now was pleased with me and so that's so he's he's taking the Honorable judgment of his brother because it is honorable because he saw did get betrayed so he has a right to be standing in judgment and he equates that judgment with with what would you say with the highest of virtues it's appropriate judgment and so he wants to make complete amends to Esau as if Esau as a representative of the divine element of justice and I guess that's convincing to ease so it's quite a thing to say you know that I need to be reconciled to you because that would simultaneously reconcile me with God it's like it's crucial this is between us but it's there's a higher principle at stake that's vital and I think that is the case with betrayal that's very frequently the case because if you betray someone you really have violated you've deeply violated what can only be called a sacred trust it's the right terminology for that take it I pray the my blessing that is brought to thee because God has dealt graciously with me and because I have enough and he urged him and he took it so you know the story seems to be something like well Jacob was kind of an arrogant crooked deceitful character maybe / impressed with his own ability he thought it was pretty amusing to pull a fast trick or two on his brother then he ran off which is not all that brave and then he got walloped of a lot and perhaps learned something and then when he came back you know he was a different person and so that's a that's a reasonable story and you know he he has to repent completely of about what he did before he can rectify the situation properly and he's willing to do that so that's an interesting idea too because it's it's it's the early reflection of the idea that it is if you do something wrong in the past a that you can learn from it right so that you're actually capable of learning and be that you can set the balance right in the present those are very optimistic ideas you know because you might say well once you've committed some sort of crime that's it there's no hope for you but that's pretty rough because the probability that you've done unethical things at some point in your life is a hundred percent and so if there was no way of setting the balance right after that then everybody would be doomed so so then the story gets rough again Jacob settles in Shalem Shalem Dinah his daughter goes looking around for friends Shechem the son of Hamor lays with her and then once her for his wife he actually has the order reversed there that turns out to be a problem Jacob hears of this the fathers talk and so they make an agreement the agreement is is that if all of hammers men including hammer and his son are circumcised so that's the proper offering I guess that brings them into the familial fold and indicates that they're willing to make a sacrifice to do so especially after you know Shechem put the cart before the horse let's say the man of hammer or circumcised they agree to do so that turns out to be a big mistake so well they're laying around the next day suffering madly from the circumcision Simeon and Levi come in they sneak in and kill all of them and take their wealth and their women and children that's rough it's rough yeah I guess you guys noticed that a so-so at their honor societies right and there's still lots of honor societies in the world and so they don't take kindly to what happened to their to their sister although they don't kill her so now it turns out that yeah it says as it came to pass on the third day when they were sore the two of the sons of Jacob Simeon and Levi Dinah's brethren took each man his sword and came upon the city boldly and slew all the males and they slew hamor and shechem his son with the edge of the sword and took Dinah out of Chekhov's house and went out the sons of Jacob came upon the slain and spoiled the city because they had defiled their sister it took the sheep and the oxen and the alysus and that which was in the city and that was which it was in the field and all their wealth and all their little ones and their wives took they came captive and spoiled everything else that was in the house and Jacob actually turns out not to be very happy about that because he'd met with hammer and they'd like hammered out a deal and that and that's where they were living and so he figured well that he was making the best of a bad law let's say and his sons went behind his back and Jacob says to Simeon and Levi you have troubled me to make me meat to make me stink among the inhabitants of the land among the Canaanites and the perizzites and I being few in number they shall gather themselves now together against me and slay me and I shall be destroyed I had my house and they said should he deal with our sister as with a harlot and God said unto Jacob and this is where we get back to the idea of the center God says to Jacob arise go to Bethel and dwell there okay so Bethel was where Jacob had originally put that pillar so now it's back so he it's it's it's a real hero's journey right there's there's the place that he has a set place he goes out and has these adventures and and undergoes a moral transformation reconciles and then he comes back to the same place right as it transformed person so that's a full hero cycle arise go to Bethel and dwell there and make that there an altar unto God that appeared to thee when thou fled us from the face of Esau thy brother and Jacob said to his household and to all that were with him put away the strange gods that are among you and be clean and change your garments and let us arise and go up to Bethel and I will make there an altar unto God who answered me in the day of my distress and was with me in the way which I went and they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in their hand and all their earrings which were in their ears and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem and they journeyed and the terror of God was upon the cities that were round about them and they did not pursue after the sons of Jacob so Jacob came to laws which is in the land of Canaan that is Bethel so that's the place where he put up the pillar to begin with he and all the people that were there with him and he built there an altar and called the place el Bethel because their God appeared to him when he fled from the face of his brother and God appeared to Jacob again when he came out of peda an aram and blessed him and God said unto Him thy name is Jacob thy name shall not be called any more Jacob which you remember means usurper but Israel shall be thy name he who wrestles with God and he called his name Israel and God said to him I am God Almighty be fruitful and multiply a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee and Kings shall come out of thy loins and the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac to thee I will give it and to thy seed after thee will I give the land and God went up from him in the place where he talked with him and God set up Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him a pillar of stone and he poured a drink offering thereon and he poured oil thereon and Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him Bethel so he's returned to the central place which had been given to him as his territory Rachel dies in labor in the process giving birth to an only son of my sorrow whose name was then changed to Benjamin son of the right hand now Reuben so Simeon and Levi have already done something unforgivable now Reuben it's Reubens term he sleeps with Bilhah who's Jacob Israel's concubine so he's the third of the sons to make an unforgivable error and Jacob / Israel gets wind of it so Reuben is no longer he would have been the premier son given that the two older sons were put out of the running so to speak because of their disobedience and impulsive vengeful cruelty and then Reuben can't keep is what do they say well you get the idea yeah yeah seems to be something that's still quite surprisingly common so then we have this story that that basically ends with this establishment of the twelve tribes of Israel from Leah there's Reuben Simeon Levi Judah Issachar and Zebulun from Zilpah there's gad and ashur from billah there's Dan and Naphtali and from Rachel there's Joseph who figures extraordinarily importantly in the next story that we're going to cover which hopefully will wrap up Genesis and Benjamin and so now Israel itself is established and so then we turn to actually going to end this early tonight that's quite bloody miracle so the story then turns to Joseph and the story begins essentially now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children because he was the son of his old age and he made him a coat of many colors and so what that seems to me to indicate you know coats in dreams very often seems to be particularly true of women's dreams that's that's been like my clinical observation clothing and footwear in particular symbolizes a role and that makes sense right because you address for the roles it's not that big a mystery but so then you might say well what does a coat of many colors indicate and you know if you think of that multiplicity there it's something like the mastery of multiple domains right or maybe something like plural potentiality and so Jacob is is Israel's or Joseph is Israel's favorite and because he sees in him this excess possibility and he basically tells his other sons that Jacob is going to be the head son which they are not happy with right because he's just this young punk fundamentally and he's clearly his father's favorite and he gets this coat that's sort of indicative of this higher status and so Israel inadvertently sets up a tremendous amount of sibling rivalry in the household again and that that's the the understructure of the last story in Genesis and so in in the last of this lecture series for 2017 we'll cover the story of Joseph and and his coat of many colors and what happens as a consequence of his of the favoritism shown to him by his father and we'll track what happens as a consequence of that and so I'm going to stop there because I'm finished so hello dr."

    "text": "Pearson this is an idea I've been wrestling with for quite some time now this idea of a lot of like the greatest sources of wisdom that we've received through human history either through texts experiences or scriptures seems to always come from people going to isolation and then coming back so I've had a hard time trying to figure out from a scientific point of view or evolutionary point of view what would compel an organism to that is that is centered around its behave its behavior centered around surviving in especially for humans as social groups as well as reproducing to want to go into isolation and then not only that but obtain some level of information that actually helps the group in coming back that's a really good question okay so there's this neuroscientist neuropsychologist named el Conan Goldberg and Goldberg was a student of Alexander Luria and Alexander Luria was a Russian neuropsychologist perhaps the foremost neuropsychologist of the mid to late 20th century and he had students Sokolov in vineger dov'è who discovered the orienting reflex for example the orienting reflexes the reflex that Orient's you when something anomalous interferes with your goal directed behavior it's a major discovery like one of the one of the four or five most important discoveries that have ever been made in in in psychology I would say certainly in neuroscience so Luria was a big deal and he was the first person who really established the functional role of the prefrontal cortex as well so and had it very nice overall view of how the brain function his book was written in 1980 and it's still there's still loss in it that's really useful which is pretty strange for a science that's advanced that quickly anyways so Goldberg came from a great pedigree I believe Maria's teacher was have if I remember correctly so anyways Goldberg you know you hear some of you may have heard the idea that the left hemisphere is more or linguistic than the right hemisphere is that left hemisphere is specialized for language and the right hemisphere is specialized for nonverbal imagistic communication the left hemisphere has a pretty well organized microstructure and the right hemisphere is more diffuse as well and that's true in left-handed males in particular so the circuitry can be switched around a bit but it's okay the modules are basically the same although they can be moved a little bit but Goldberg thought that it isn't language versus non language it's routine versus novelty and so the left hemisphere and there's a neuropsychologist physician named Ramachandran who's done some very interesting work that's pertinent to this maybe I'll tell you a story about him anyways Goldberg believed that the right hemisphere say you have very old systems underneath both both cortical hemispheres that do things like respond to anomaly to the thing that doesn't fit to the predator in the distance some of that's extraordinarily fast so that would be like a snake reflex that can move you away from a snake in less time than it takes the snake to bite and it's really a reflex it doesn't even hit your brain it's really super fast and then there's a defensive Crouch that's that's instantiated higher up in the nervous system but that's still remarkably fast and then there's fear as an emotion and and the orientation of attention and then there's the cognitive processing and that all streams out across a time span right and maybe that time span is half a second so you and that's really a long time if something is attacking you so you got those initial responses are quite primitive but they're extraordinarily fast all right so there's subcortical structures that orient you towards novelty and prepare you for for freezing or for it and the right hemisphere seems to be dominated by those systems so imagine that what happens is that something threatens you you orient towards it the right hemisphere produces a bunch of images about what it might be so imagine that's what happens when a child is afraid of the dark the child's on the bed they're afraid of the dark they're crouched because they're frozen like a prey animal and their right hemisphere is producing monsters to inhabit the the darkness that are the child's hypotheses about what might be out there okay because that's what you want to know right you want to know what's out there and then you want to know what to do about it I can tell you two kids dreams that are sort of relevant to that so when my daughter was about three she came into the bedroom that my wife and I had and she was crying she'd had a nightmare and she said that she saw a stream and there was garbage all over the stream and she didn't like that and so I sat her down I said okay so imagine the stream with the garbage in it now imagine that you're taking the garbage out and throwing it in the garbage bin and so she and I got her to like visualize that because that kind of puts her back in the semi dream state and then she cleaned up the mess and then she could go off to sleep now you you could tell the child don't worry about the dream isn't real that's not that's true because it's not real like other daytime things are but it's not like it's not real it's a dream like a dream is real it's just not the same kind of real and so what I did with her was to indicate to her practically that if she saw something a normal uh something that was out of place right something that was a mess that it was within her capacity to set it right okay and so okay so now your right hemisphere tells you what monsters might inhabit the the darkness now what you have to do is figure out there's two things you have to figure out one is what to do about a given monster and now there is to do what about is to figure out what to do about the class of all possible monsters right that's a whole different thing that's something that only human beings are capable of that level of abstraction right and so what you might do about a particular monster is hide or go out and get rid of it if it was just an actual animal right but that doesn't help because there's all the other potential predators that are still there and so maybe you can go hunt all them down but that doesn't help either because you can't hunt them all down it's not or it's not very likely anyways so instead what you have to do is figure out how to configure yourself so that you're in the best possible position to fight off the monsters when they come that's your best bet all right so now people are trying to figure this out forever they're trying to figure out what's the answer to the problem of the class of all possible monsters part of that sacrifice so there are routines for example in in Hinduism with the goddess Kali you make offerings to Kelly who's this devouring goddess and then she turns into her benevolent counterpart and so sacrifice is actually one way that you can tame the monsters if you think about the monster has the set of all negative future potentialities you make the proper sacrifice as those monsters stay at bay but then there's heroism as an alternative to which which means the act of confrontation of the class of all possible monsters and the building of yourself up and into this sort of courageous person that can do that it took a tremendous amount of meditation to transform those images say of the monsters in into it or to solve the problem of the class of those monsters so now I'll tell you another child stream so some of you have probably heard this before but it's such a great dream that it's worth it's worth telling so now is that my sister-in-law's house once and her son was running around he's about four very precocious very verbal very intelligent running around with a knight hat on and a sword so he's engaged in this pretty intense play world and when he goes to sleep he puts the knight hat on his pillow and the sword by his pillow and at the same time he having night terrors so he's waking up and had been for a number of weeks Nate waking up screaming and then but he doesn't know why there's some things that aren't going so well in the household and the parents get divorced shortly afterwards okay so that's oh that's that's what's going on underneath right and he's also gonna go to kindergarten and so he's about to go into the world and so he's coping with this you know so I'm watching him zoom around as this night and thinking that's pretty cool and that night he woke up and had a it was screaming and so we're all at breakfast the next morning and I said did you dream anything and he got really intense and he said yes I had a dream and I said well what was the dream and he said well I was out on this field and all these like dwarfs came up to me they were only about as high as my knees and they didn't have any arms they have powerful legs and they were covered with like hairy feathers and grease and there was cross carved in the top of their head and they had beaks and whenever he moved anywhere they would jump at him with his with their beaks and there were lots of them and everyone like just said nothing at breakfast it was like yeah cuz and he was right into this story and so we were all like yeah well huh there are that accounts for all the screaming and so and then he said yeah and then in the background there was a dragon and every time the dragon puffed out smoke it would turn into these dwarves it's like oh man kid you really got a problem there you got you got beat things that are biting you and you can kill them and that's fine but then there's the dragon just puffing out new ones so it's like a Hydra problem right the old Hydra is the serpent you cut off one had seven more grow it's not a good thing and it's such a cool dream because it really portrayed this class of all possible monsters problem so you've got the specific monsters and that's a problem so you got to get rid of them but that's not the problem the problem is is that there's a there's something in the background that's just generating monsters like mad and so I said to him what do you think you could do about that and that's a that's a loaded question right that's like leading the witness in the trial you don't get to ask a question like that because it implies that it implies the answer what could you do about that is not any different than saying you could do something about that right so so I hinted at that as a possibility and his eyes lit up now you remember he's already running around as at night Hey so he kind of already knew what to do because he had the whole sword in the Hat and with that you know that you can go after the drag and he kind of got that and he said I'd get my dad and then I jump up on top of the dragon and I'd poke out both of its eyes with my sword and then he'd go right down its throat to the fire box where the fire comes out and I carve out a piece of the fire box and then I'd used that as a shield and I thought yes right right man it's so smart eh because he got the thing instantly he knew that he knew so imagine first of all he thought okay I have to go to the heart of the problem right and really to the heart not to the dragon but right down the dam thanks gullet right to the place where the fire was actually being it was actually being created because there it was there you could find the shield and that he'd take this thing that was fireproof and make a shield out of it and so that was just he had bloody perfect it was so cool and you think well how could a kid come up with that and there's a bunch of answers I mean one is we know snake fear is innate we know that now there's been recent research data that that has demonstrated that okay so and we've been preyed on and been predators for a very long period of time so the idea that and I found something else interesting about the brain out that dubrow out about the brain recently - and book I was reading by Ray Kurzweil called how to build a mind I think that's what it was called it was quite a good book so I think it was in that book or it was in the neuroscience paper I was reading doesn't matter but it was in one of those two places so you know that scanning technology has got more and more high resolution over the last few years right it just gets more and more high-resolution all the time and so people are now able to look at the micro structures of the brain in a way that hasn't been possible before and so the old idea with the cortex basically was that cortex was full of a bunch of neurons and then when one neuron and another fired at the same time they would wire together and that's kind of how your brain learned to make connections it's a bit more complicated than that but that will do and then it was found that it wasn't quite that simple because what your cortex is made out of are these columns of neurons that are duplicated sort of like a like centipedes legs you know it's very simple genetic code to add another leg set of legs to a centipede it's sort of like that with your brain it's made out of all these columns and the columns are basically already quite wired up and then as you learn the columns wired together okay so there's some pre-existence structure there but there's more preexisting structure than what that was thought so it's it's basically that there are already tracts that link columns together that are in different parts of the brain and the columns can or the columns themselves can send out dendrites to these superhighways which are already there and then the superhighway is there and then it can generate connections to the columns at the end of the superhighway so what that means is that there's a tremendous amount of cortical structure already in place but there's plasticity around that and when I read that I thought well that's part of the source of the archetypes there's already an archetypal structure there that as well as the subcortical structures so you could say that like the kid already had within him not only the capacity to represent not only the monster but the class of all possible monsters and the fact that the problem wasn't monsters the problem was that monsters could continually be generated which is a way worse problem and then the answer to that isn't to kill an individual monster the answer to that is go to the source of the monstrous itself and defeat it so it's absolutely staggering and you could imagine that it would take a tremendous amount of meditate of effort for people to have come up with that solution over a very long period of time so now the point of the representation is to formulate a picture of what it is that's the threat so that you can then formulate a general purpose solution and so there's this image of Kali which I really like because Kelly is sort of the goddess of the darkness let's say in destruction and so Kelly is she has a headdress of fire her hair is on fire and she has a headdress of skulls and she has hands cut off all around her neck and she has a belt that's often snakes but it's sometimes she sometimes eating the intestines of this guy that she's just given birth to and that she's sitting on she has eight legs like a spider and she's in a web of fire and so she's a monster in some sense that represents everything that might terrify and devour you and the question is so you come up with that representation as an image to represent the class of all terrifying things and then you have to generate a solution in the face of that class and sacrifice is one of the solutions but that heroic encounter is another one of the solutions and that's the one that he catalyzed now he'd been read lots of books he'd watched lots of Disney movies you know and and he'd seen the heroic pattern portrayed many many places and his little brain was working like mad to extract out the essence of that and to embody it and when I asked him that question it just went snap and all those things lined up and his night terrors went away that was it and I followed up with his mom because it was really quite remarkable the whole set of occurrences you know and he didn't have night terrors that night even though he'd been having the nightly and that was the end of them because he'd solved his problem like he needed to be the courageous knight that went after the dragon and so that is what people need to be so I think when we go into solitude we shut off the external stimulation and we let the Dreaming part of our mind emerge and that's this nonverbal pattern detector that thinks in images and it's it's the thing that mediates between what we don't understand and what we do understand like if you understand it completely you can say it and you can act it out if you don't understand it you represent it in images and there it's like it's the emotion fear withdrawal paralysis and then that manifests itself in an image of what that might be and that image is the basis for the story and it's the basis for further development of the idea and to go into isolation is to let those images emerge and to dream a little bit and then that moves you that moves you ahead into the future so language they use before it's enough just to map out the danger that is imminent in front of you but all the potential dangers that you could come up with in abstract form yeah well remember what happens when God throws Adam and Eve out of out of paradise they become aware that they're going to die right the future becomes a problem because you could say the future is the place of all potential monsters right and so just the monster that you have right in front of you it's like yeah well you get rid of that but that doesn't solve your problem does it the problem is how do you exist in a world full of monsters and part of that answer is well you become a monster yourself that's a big part of the answer but it's an incomplete answer because if you're just a monster then you're just as bad as the monsters so you have to trance you have to be a monstrous enough to contend with the monsters but then you have to be civilized enough so that you're not a monster yourself and that's more or less equivalent to the Union inter integration of the shadow so yep yeah hiya dr."

    "text": "Peterson now I've been wanting to ask you this for a while now since I started watching your lectures after I started reading and nici's Beyond Good and Evil I came upon a paragraph in his chapter on scholars that really really bothered me and it actually bothers me to this day he talked about this kind of person like they were just a mirror-like they stretched he said every part of their skin basically to allow every new piece of information that they took on and that all they ever were was just an instrument they were just a mirror on reflecting what they had learned never actually having generated anything on their own and it's it's bothered me because I feel like in a way it's sort of like it's it's it's impacted my identity a lot because I don't know how are you supposed to create something you know ok well that's ok that that's a really good question I mean Nietzsche is often classed with the existentialists right and so one of the tenants of existentialist there's two real tenants of existentialism there's more but obviously we're oversimplifying but one is that life is a problem it isn't because there's something wrong with you it's that life is a problem and so that's often contrasted with the Freudian view which is that if you have a problem it's because something went wrong during your development the existentialist said no no it's like life is a problem make no mistake about it and that the purpose of the purpose of scholarship is in some sense to solve that problem and so for Nietzsche like he said all truths are bloody truths to me and what he meant by that was that if an idea didn't incarnate itself in you and transform your perceptions and your actions then you were merely possessed by the idea you were merely a spokesperson for the idea or you could say that the idea possessed you you're a puppet for the idea it's not you it's the idea is in you and it has you you haven't taken the idea and incorporated with you and made it part of your life and so there's a romanticism that's associated with that right that's the passionate scholar the person for whom ideas are not merely they're not merely what would you call abstracted representations that can be tossed about as if they're commodities there there there are more like pert they're more like personalities that might be another way of thinking about it and so if you're if if those ideas are compelling then you don't like one thing I learned a long time ago and I think this is probably relevant I know when I was a kid I like to argue and I like to win arguments or or or lose them although I like winning them a lot better but I didn't really mind so much what the content of the argument was you know I could engage in it like a sparring match and it was in some sense to establish dominance right to establish intellectual dominance I quit doing that when I was in my mid-20s because I thought that that was too shallow an approach to the ideas they they're not commodities of that sort they're there they have tendrils that reach down into the living that's the right way to think about it and so Nietzsche's criticism of scholars and he did this a lot was that they were bloodless you know they didn't they were full of performative contradictions that's another way of thinking about they'd say one thing and do another because their intellect was completely dissociated from their from their actions and Heath he he thought that was a very bad idea and I think that that's a good criticism I think it is a bad idea I also think it makes for an extraordinarily boring lecturer you know because you can tell if you're listening to someone whether the idea is that you're hearing are merely being passed through the person as if they're being memorized say or whether they're part of the dynamic core of the person and if they're part of the dynamic core of the person then they're almost always engaging and gripping and so he wasn't a fan of bloodless scholars and I think that's correct because one of the things that I see it's not a good idea to have ideas possess you unless you know what the ideas are up to and lots of people are possessed by ideas rather than possessing them and that what that means is they haven't taken the ideas and integrated them into their own being they haven't it's like an incarnation in a sense they haven't incarnated the ideas in an embodied form and and so they're incomplete you know Nietzsche also in thus spake Zarathustra when Zarathustra comes down the mountain he sees a bunch of people gathered around a famous individual I think maybe a scholar but doesn't really matter and when Zarathustra goes in looks at the person all he sees his little tiny with a gigantic ear and so he's a hyper specialist right and so he has a pretty impressive ear but he's only this big and that was Nietzsche's imagistic commentary on the danger of hyper specialization and also on the danger of adulation for hyperspecialization and and because he thought about it as a kind of deformity now Nietzsche was a pretty harsh guy but but he did address the issue of the relationship between intellectual knowledge and and action because for Nietzsche those things are not to be separated in some sense so yeah so maybe I don't know why it maybe it bothered you like it's hard to say why it bothered you it might have bothered you because it's sort of undermined the idea of scholar but the other possibility and this isn't an accusation because obviously I don't know anything about you but it might also be that it struck a chord you know and that maybe you were doubtful or questioning how tightly associated your intellectual endeavor was with your actual character and your practice so that's another possibility I mean that's a really good thing to think about because generally speaking that integration is it is very much lacking people are a lot smarter and fluid with their ideas than they are ethical and consistent and characterized by integrity so yep hey um so last week you talked about how you hated people asking you if you believe in God or do you believe in miracles or you just like those questions elytis but you also talked about how and I want to put words in your mouth but I think you said something about the idea of an empirical evidence for religious experiences or spiritual experiences and I wonder how those two ideas can a spiritual existence or can a spiritual experience exist without God or who knows who knows you know I don't know what I don't know what to make of that I mean you could it depends on what you're willing to accept as proof I suppose that's where things get tricky you know if you have to demonstrate the existence of God objectively then subjective experiences of the transcendent are irrelevant right but and and that's a perfectly reasonable standpoint if your initial presupposition is the only thing that has actual existence is those things that can be demonstrated objectively and I'm not putting that down like that's a powerful methodology our technology is basically dependent on the acceptance at least a partial acceptance of those axioms but I also think that it's difficult for me to deny the existence of these patterns of thinking that seem to exist cross-culturally like the existence of the representation of the Dragon for example especially given that I can see an evolutionary rationale for the emergence of these representations so and then there's also the indisputable fact that religious experiences are accessible to people through a number of different avenues now and one of the things I mentioned when I discussed this before is well you could say well those are no different than experiences of psychopathology but they are different because the experiences of psychopathology damage people whereas the evidence is that the transcendent experiences actually help people so unless you can unless you're willing to say well there are some forms of psychopathological experience that actually facilitate health which is possibility but you know I think you're you're pushing your hypothesis at that point I'm not sure what you're saying about a religious experience is what I'm well generally a religious experience is something like an experience of the of the renewal of the world that might be one way of thinking about it so that everything sort of leaps forward as crystalline and perfect as if you had been viewing it from behind a mask before another would be a sense of the union of everything and so you're a singular being and you're isolated and in the religious experiences so for example there's a book written recently by a neuroscientist my stroke of what's it called my stroke of insight yeah that's right and I believe she had a left hemisphere stroke if I remember correctly and she was sufficiently well-developed neuroscientists to understand what was happening as she had the stroke and and she had a intense religious experience as a consequence of that and she experienced it as a dissolution of the ego into this state of union with everything and this transcendent experience of awe and and the open well I don't remember the rest of it I mean there are other elements of religious experience that are quite common the idea of the opening of the heavens that's one the communion with the ancestors that's another the reduction of the body to a skeleton that's another movement up into heaven like these are well documented phenomena and a lot of them are associated well of a fair number of them were associated with psychedelic use but that's not the only Avenue to experiences like that and epilepsy can produce experiences like that too and then people usually report a near-death experience as well you know people usually report that those experiences have life-altering significance now that in and of itself only proves that people are capable of having subjective religious experiences right it doesn't definitively prove there's anything outside of that so young Carl young for example most of the time he didn't talk about God he talked about the God image which is not the same thing because you could have a god image that was even evolutionarily instantiated without that necessarily being rep to any transcendent being beyond the image right so who knows who knows again I think it depends on what you're willing to accept as proof now the proof the it's beyond question that can people can have life-changing religious experiences another example of that is that the best treatment for alcoholism is religious conversion it's well documented in the literature and I studied alcoholism for a long time so one of the cures that sticks is religious conversion and the 12-step programs essentially attempt to instantiate religious conversion and it's hard to document their success because they succeed for the people who stick with it but that's not a very good measure right it's sort of it's sort of self-evident that they work for the people who stick with it I'm not cynical about about Alcoholics Anonymous or anything but we don't have good data on on outcome but there is good data showing that religious transformation is a good cure for for alcoholism so and that's an interesting phenomena too it's too complicated I probably can't okay I'll try I'll try this for a second so here's how I think a religious conversion might work so imagine you've got the left hemisphere and it's the place where your habitual interpretations reside so I can give you a quick example of this so this guy Ramachandran who's a neurophysiologist or I think that's his that's his field of study I think he's at UCLA he studied people who hadn't neglect and neglects is a very very bizarre phenomena so if you have a stroke that damages your right parietal lobe you'll lose the left part of your being not just your body it's really weird it's like so for example if you have a right parietal stroke and you look at a clock you only see you only only half the clock exists for you it's not like you only see half the clock it's weirder than that it's that there's only the right side of the clock there's only the right side of you there's only the right side of my body I don't know that this exists and so sometimes people with right parietal damage will wake up after the stroke and grab their left arm and throw it out of bed and or their leg and throw it out of bed because it's not theirs and then of course they fall out of bed which is quite a shock to them so and so now they'll only eat half the food on the plate nobody can really understand this phenomena logically right because we can't imagine what that must be like I think it must be like you know how you know there's things behind you but you don't not see them they're just not there it's not like it's black or anything or there's a space it's just not there and so I think what happens is the not there extends to three-quarters of the field instead of half the field that's a guess anyway so ramas now the funny thing about people with neglect is that if you tell them if you point it out you say well I noticed that you're not moving your left foot today they'll say well it's it's arthritic and I can't move it and say well why do you just try to move it so no look doctor I already told you it's in too much pain to move it was working fine this morning that can be months after the the accident so it's a denial and and people thought actually that that was trauma induced denial for a long time before they figured it out was actually a consequence of the neurophysiological damage you know Ramachandran found that if you irrigated the contralateral ear say now if you pour cold water in someone's ear it upsets their vestibular system and their eyes will move back and forth like this you can try that at a party if you want and anyways Ramachandran was testing vestibular function on these patients and he irrigated the right ear with cold water and they woke up and maybe what happened was that that was shocking enough so imagine the networks in the right hemisphere were degraded but not completely gone and they needed a really high threshold of activation to snap into function so here's an example of that if you have Parkinson's disease imagine you're frozen there okay and I throw a ball at you you'll go like this and catch it but you can't throw it back so you can the stimulus is enough that's enough to push you past threshold but you can't do it voluntarily now if you have Parkinson's like right to the tenth degree you won't even be able to couch it but there's a stage where you could still do that there's a great case study where this grandpa was in a wheelchair he had Parkinson's and his young grandson was playing out on the dock and fell in the water and started to drown and he got out of his wheelchair went into the ocean rescued him brought him onto the beach sat back down in his wheelchair and was paralyzed together so that was enough so you can imagine there was enough network left so if the emotional tension became high enough that the degraded circuits could still function so okay so back to Ramachandran so you irrigate the ear all of a sudden the right hemisphere connections flash the remainders managed to connect and the person goes oh my god I've had a terrible stroke I've lost the left side of my body they're crying they're like completely catastrophic aliy overwhelmed by it and then 20 minutes later the the effects wear off and they snap back in and now they they've lost their left side again they don't remember it and so what seems to happen is that the right hemisphere is collecting anomalous information that's what it does that's what it does when you're dreaming it's it's it's it's representing that anomalous information in image form and sort of slowly passing it to the left hemisphere so it doesn't overwhelm it and maybe if it gets overwhelming you wake up and you're afraid and you tell someone about the dream that helps you figure out what it was but anyways so that the right hemisphere is always trying to tap the left hemisphere into transformation right so now imagine that that can happen a little bit or a lot so maybe you're just ignoring a little bit of anomalous information you just have some mildly frightening dreams or maybe you've just stacked up a whole bunch of things that you're ignoring and there's some major-league monsters that you haven't contended with maybe there's situations where the right hemisphere is stored up enough counter enough of a counter hypothesis let's say about how the world works out make making sense out of all those things that you've ignored that one day it just goes snap and you're a new personality and maybe the new personality isn't addicted so it's something like it's something like that I think so yeah okay joke good morning citizen Peterson oh you got I've prepared a real doozy for you here oh good it's a good thing you've got extra time to handle this one I'd even say it's rehearsed a little bit so it's gonna be ultra ineffective yeah okay now I understand that a lecture on the psychological significance of anything really is going to indubitably wander off into an anthropocentric worldview but as a practitioner of the hard sciences I wanted to dig a little bit deeper you know so I sought out I guess a religious interpretation of both creative freedom and I guess the very nature of time itself and I found it obviously that's why I'm here and if you think you have an anthropocentric worldview it's nothing compared to Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger you know now I like to think that you know this microphone here the one that you keep muting out on me you know this microphone is an object which exists outside of our individual perceptions that's just the way I like to look at it but then I think about the concept beauty is in the eye of the beholder and certainly I mean when you're talking about are the appreciation of art there has to be some sort of subjective element integrated into that but there also must be a limit as well I mean certain works of art do we appreciate as absolute masterpieces like Michelangelo's pietà for example which you bring up frequently because it really is that good but there's other things which are just by comparison there like vandalism you know now there's always a temptation all right to invoke the principle of a non-overlapping magisteria but that seems like sort of a capo right so I formulated I guess for myself for standards of measure which help me separate what's the difference between art and mediocrity and here's the four number one education number two time commitment you got to put in the time if you're an artist it's probably gonna become your full-time occupation it's that you have to be that passionate about it number three public display art isn't something that you own for yourself you hide it in your basement then it's not art it's something what you have to express you know something which you've got to share and number four and I think this is the most important one efficacy of vision if you're an artist you've got to have a vision and we talked about the dream state here a lot you go into the dream state you have inspiration but it's not enough to just have the inspiration because that's totally subjective for you the art the art part about it is having the techniques and the skill and the intent and I guess the capacity to turn that into something real you know that you can then express or share so can you read cardinal ratzinger as explanation for the nature of time and then address the concept of beauty in the eye of the beholder with specific reference to the body positivity movement how sheesh misses no I don't think I can I think I think I think that's ha ha ha I think I think that you you tangled together so many things and this is also a tangle of things not that that's a criticism that I can't pull them all together with sufficient rapidity not to bore the audience to death so I'm gonna I'm gonna wait I'm gonna wait ok dr."

    "text": "Peterson I'm fascinated by the idea of faith what faith means Jacob listens to a voice and believes it he probably heard other voices why did he believe this one why what there must have been an a priori sort of functional necessity for him to believe the voice that told him one thing or another and and I think that that's a string that runs through the Bible and then through the New Testament we are expected as well I confess I'm a Christian I'm I act like I believe God is real and and so there is this call of faith and also the in in every hero's story we we see now there is always a moment in that story where the hero must believe something beyond the evidence that is before them which is to say they must take a leap of faith so I'm wondering if you can just kind of unpack that experience of faith and the understanding of how a human being makes the choice to believe one thing or another god that's a great question I mean uh is this still on is this still working okay okay okay good um I don't I don't precisely know the answer that it's it's a very peculiar thing because we think many things or you could say many voices appear in our minds because when Nietzsche took des cartes I think therefore I am apart and he said well it isn't so obvious that there's an AI first of all that it's a unity like a no unity transparent unto itself which of course the psychoanalysts picked up in a big way and then he wasn't sure that it was the AI who thought in some causal manner he said well no it's more like thoughts it's something like thoughts appear in the phenomenal field and maybe you choose between them or maybe they possess you like there's lots of other ways of thinking about it it isn't exactly obvious to me why we choose to take one pathway rather than another when so many of them offer themselves to us you know people tend to talk about that as something like conscience right and now maybe it's that it's got to have something to do I think it's an endless regress because you can always ask why the why any assumption became primary but I'll put that aside for a moment it seems to me to have something to do with your aims you know that you're more likely to listen to a voice that is in keeping with your most fundamental aims and then the question is where do your most fundamental aims come from and from what I've been able to determine and I'll speak psychologically again is that to begin with you're a concatenation of rather primitive sub personalities hungry ones tired one's upset ones laughing one so you can see that in babies you know they cycle through those states very rapidly there's a infantile unity above all that but it doesn't have control right and so then the developing individual has to figure out how to integrate those primitive sub personalities into a unified personality at the same time they integrate the unified personality into a social unity so it's partly individual integration but it's fed by social forces I mean even when you watch a an infant breastfeed its established a relationship with its mother and there's a reciprocity that's already at play there so then that underlying multiplicity starts to form itself into a unity and then the question and I would say that's something like that's something like the emergence of the the individual out of out of the the Titans that's a reasonable way of thinking about it like a sovereign out of the Titans it's something like that but then there's another division which seems to me to paralyse parallel the the Cain and Abel division it's that that integration can be oriented towards something that's positive but it can also be oriented towards something that's negative and that's the split of the world into good and evil I think and then it looks like you're navigating between those and I can only account for that with something like choice like I think the free choice even though I don't understand it I'm unwilling to deny the existence of free choice merely because I don't understand it because it looks to me like that's how people act that's how they expect to be treated and that societies who that that structure themselves in accordance with the idea that people have free choice actually work now that doesn't prove that there's free choice but people have been arguing about that forever so but it looks to me so those are two possible means of integration and then I think what you're doing is feeding one or the other constantly and I think you probably choose which one to feed I think that's and I mean that's how it feels that way to me as well like when I look at my own you know maybe you're really aggravated with something maybe you're aggravated with your wife you know or your child or something like that you know and you're feeling kind of nasty and maybe even know that you're in the wrong and an idea comes into your head you think I could say that and no you could say it and you know what it would do but then you pause and you think would that make it better or worse and then maybe you go to hell with it which is a quite the thing to say I've got a little story about that in a minute and then you say it but you knew you knew that you took the low road right and you know it and then you're guilty about that and defensive and that makes the fight way worse because then there's no damn way you're gonna admit that you actually did that and so things do go to hell and so so here's here's an ugly little idea so that's that's that's relevant to the question so imagine you're playing around with cocaine now I'm using cocaine because it's very addictive but it's a very interesting chemical because it's a dopaminergic agonist and what what dopamine does is two things it makes you feel like what you're doing is worthwhile but it also imagined that there's a bunch of neural circuits that are active and then they get a hit of dopamine or you do then those neural circuits get a little bit more powerful okay so it it has a rewarding property which is that it makes you feel like what you're doing is important and it has a reinforcing property which is it makes neural circuits grow so now what that means is that whatever you were doing just before you took cocaine grows okay so now imagine there's a bunch of different things that you do just before you take cocaine but there's a string of decisions and at one decision point is the same for all of those difference occurrences and that decision point is because you know you're in trouble and that decision point is well to hell with it okay so then you think that each of the 200 times that you take cocaine even though you do it in different places but that one thought is there all the time and that thing grows because you're reinforcing it and it grows and it grows and it grows and so now that's in you let's that's part of you and it's the thing that says to hell with it okay so now and maybe that's not such a good thing to grow inside your brain so then you your idea and they take you to a cocaine treatment center and after a week you're no longer physically physiologically addicted you're not craving you don't have a problem as long as you're there but then they take you back to your normal environment and you see like cocaine Joe your friend and as soon as you see him up that thing comes and bang you're back on the you're back on the to hell with the track and that's well you're in well you're where you will end up - if you reinforce that particular perspective long enough so that's akin in a sense to the this decision-making process you know if you if you take the low road then that wins and it gets a little stronger because everything that wins neurologically gets a little stronger it's like a Darwinian competition so one rule is don't practice what you don't want to become because you really do become that it builds it builds itself right into your neural architecture and that's one of the terrifying things about addiction you know because you think well it's kind of psychological it's like yeah kind of it's also kind of neuro physiological and you build a one-eyed cocaine monster in your head if you hit yourself enough with something that reinforcing so yeah last question I guess it's just a really simple question then about long suffering so when it one of the things that was noticing from the stories of Jacob and a lot of these biblical narratives is you do have this all-powerful God who is able to kind of essentially be the hidden protagonist in the narrative but then the funny thing is that he's kind of revealing some of his qualities throughout the course of the story so you were talking about the weird paradox of the fact that God somehow allows Jacob Israel to win the fight yeah so my question is relating to pants EPs thing about the rats that you told like three or four times and the number of occasions I saw one even more recent videos you talked about it where the bigger rat lets the smaller rat win because then the other the smaller rat won't engage in the game so the question is is twofold for me one is God allowing humanity to win periodically so that's to allow us to actually engage in the dialogue through these stories and to is it a much more primitive version of the virtue of humility which you wouldn't normally characterize of an Amana path of anonymity omnipotent deity well those are excellent questions that's I really like the second one in particular that that that God's decision to allow human victory from time to time is actually a manifestation of something approximating humility or at least mercy but humility is an interesting take on it well it's also connected to Paul's image of how Christ handed him hands himself over and allows himself to be defeated by men and therefore conquers sin which is man's enemy it's a weird it's the same paradox where God enters into that dynamic with people and loses and willingly loses yeah well that's a okay so the first thing I would say is that that's a really interesting analogy I I I can't it's complicated enough question so that I can't go be I don't think I can go be the question actually because it's so complicated that I don't think I can formulate it any better than you already did like it's an interesting string of ideas I'd have to play with it a while to see it does shed an interesting light on why God is amenable to negotiation in the Old Testament which is really a strange as you pointed out it's really a strange thing it's like this is omnipotent God who obviously can do whatever he wants and yet he allow he can be bargained with and that also opens up the question of why like your hypothesis is well if you don't let the little rat win now and then then they get dejected and quit playing and that's I mean that's that's a pretty good observation if people don't get to win now and then you know they that's kind of what happens to Cain God says well you not playing a straight game that's why you're not winning but I don't know there's an intimation in the Old Testament and I think it's more developed in the New Testament maybe not that the straighter the game you play the more likely you are to win and so maybe part of the reason that God lets Abraham bargain and and even Jacob is because they've started to play very straight games and so maybe you do win in your wrestling with God if you play a straight game I mean I think that's I actually think that's I think the reason that's true is because that's actually why we would define it as a straight game now then we could speak psychologically again I think that what we've come to recognize as a straight game is the game that in the broadest number of situations across the widest range of time spans is most likely to produce a positive outcome and that's that's actually the grounds for our sense of ethics that it's really practical not to belabor it too much because there was there was an interesting insight from Chesterton's the man who was Thursday where God sets himself up as the benevolent antagonist so as to accelerate the game yeah well I think that's a really interesting idea I mean there is there is hints I would say throughout the biblical story that the reason that God tolerates Satan let's say is because without an adversary you're soft and that's I mean that's tied in with the notion that life is something like a moral struggle you know that that's the fundamental essence of being a moral struggle now it I think that that's phenomenologically a reasonable observation maybe it's maybe other people don't experience it that way but it seems to me like within my own experience that that's accurate now I don't know what again I don't know what that says about the fundamental nature of reality but I had a vision at one point that I was in a ring with Satan actually believe it or not and it was like a Roman Colosseum and you know I was rather upset to find myself there but I won and I asked God afterwards why he would do such a thing and his answer was he knew I could win and that's interesting you know because like I don't know what to make of that believe me I have no idea what to make of that but the idea was that if you're trying to encourage someone rather than protect them because those are really different things right to protect someone isn't to make them strong to encourage them is to make them strong then you set them a series of challenges right right at the point where they may win and maybe you could make a case that that's what you do if you really care for someone now I know that that's it I'm not saying that that interpretation is correct I'm not but but there's something mean you definitely with your children you know when you're wrestling with them say when you're playing with them you use you push them to the limit of their ability because otherwise they don't transcend their current abilities so yep [Music] so we'll see some of you perhaps most of you in December and I think we'll finish off Genesis at that point and then in the new year probably not till the spring I'll start with exodus which I'm really looking forward to because I really like the Exodus story it's an amazing story and unbelievably deep note well the ones we've covered so far being you know pretty good as well but so thank you all for coming and we'll perhaps see you in about a month"

So Nietzsche believed that that Catholicization of the phenomena of life and of history produced the kind of mind that was then capable of transcending its dogmatic foundations and then concentrating on something else.

And so Nietzsche believed that, in some sense, that Christianity died at its own hand that spent a very long period of time trying to attune people to the necessity of the truth."

By that he meant that you don't go from childhood to full-fledged adult individuality. You go from childhood to a state of discipline, which you might think is akin to slavery, to self-imposed slavery, that would be the best scenario, where you have to discipline yourself to become something specific, before you might be able to re-attain the generality that you had as a child. And he believed that Christianity had played that role for Western civilization. But, in the late 1800s, he announced that God was dead."

See, Nietzsche understood that, this is something I'm going to try to make clear, is that there's a very large amount that we don't know about the structure of experience, that we don't know about reality. And we have our articulated representations of the world, and then you can think of outside of that: there are things we know absolutely nothing about. And there's a buffer between them. And those are things we sort of know something about. We don't know them in an articulated way, here's an example.

And that sickness of the spirit, its cure is something like an integrated system of belief and representation.

If that wasn't the case, then we wouldn't need a psychology or a sociology or an anthropology or any of that because we would be completely transparent to ourselves. And we're clearly not.

And I believe El is the root word for Allah, as well. And that's usually translated as God or the gods, because Elohim is utilized as plural in the beginning books of the Bible. And it's newer that the Jahwist version. Now, the reason I'm telling you that is because Genesis 1, which is the first story, isn't as old as Genesis 2.

You make your marriage out of the arguments. Okay. You know, you have arguments with your wife, you have arguments with you children. That's that chaotic state. Because no one's been able to formulate a habitable order from that domain of controversy and confusion. And then, through dialogue, you erect a structure that's a house that you can both live in.

I believe that that's the right answer, and I think that the West, in particular, is predicated on that idea. Because it makes the state subservient to the individual.

Sometimes she did. In one of her dreams, one of the characters told her that she would have to learn to live with a slaughterhouse. She was very afraid of life, and one of the consequences of that was that we went and watched them bombing. So but one of the things she did, she'd ask the characters what they were up to, you know?

You might be interested in reading Jung's books on active imagination. Because he kind of learned to dream when he was awake.

So we have to maintain this articulated space inside the dream inside the custom, something like that. Because otherwise it doesn't work. And I think that's the same as having respect for the fact that we have bodies. You know, we're not just abstract creatures that follow rules. We're not that at all. You only follow certain rules. We won't follow the other ones, and our societies will crumble. And so, we just don't know enough to articulate the entire landscape of behavior with articulated rules, not at all. We can't do it, it's beyond us. [APPLAUSE] Hi, thanks for the talk. My question is also about dreams."

    "text": "You spoke about dreams as like a representation of truths and universal truths that can be interpreted into, like, myths and religion. And, as you say it, it's very beneficial for the individual, and it sounds like also for society as well because not everyone can as easily remember their dreams, or interpret their dreams. And also it's broadcasted to all of society for their benefit. So I guess I'm wondering what the evolutionary advantage of dreams are and my question might be, do you think that dreams suggest some sort of evolutionary group selection, such that groups that don't have these dreams that are represented into myths and legend, do you think they didn't survive as well?"

    "text": "Okay, so I'm not going to answer the second part of that question because I'd have to go far too far off at a tangent for me to manage right now. But I can answer the first part. What happens when you're dreaming, there's a little switch, so to speak, in your brain that shuts off when you're dreaming and it stops you from moving. Right? It shuts everything off except your eyes, because if you're moving your eyes back and forth, you're not going to run around and get eaten by a lion. It's okay to move your eyes. But the rest of you is staying exactly where it is. Then you can run these simulations. And so what's happening at night, and this is a fairly well-accepted theory of dreaming, we know that dreams update memories and help consolidate memories. They also help you forget."

    "text": "But what seems to be happening at night is you're running the underlying architecture of your cognitive ability in different simulations. And it's cost free because you're paralyzed. You're not running around out there out in the world, investigating. So it's part of the manner in which your brain experiments with the way the world can be represented. And so it seems absolutely necessary. I mean, if you deprive people of REM sleep, they don't stay sane very long. There's something necessary about the dreaming process to maintenance of articulated sanity. So you're doing some sort of organization at night when you descend into that chaos. Partly what seems to happen is that your categories have boundaries, right? But sometimes you don't have the categories correct."

And in the dream, the category structure loosens, which is why dreams are so peculiar. But they're experimenting. Your mind is experimenting with the underlying categorical structure of imagination. And trying to update your mode of being in the world. Dreams often concentrate on things that provoke anxiety. So if you wake people up when they're dreaming, the most commonly reported emotion is anxiety. So the dream is like the first stages of the attempt to contend with the unknown. So the dream is half unknown and half known. Which is also why it's so peculiar, you know, because you kind of understand it, but you don't really. And it partakes of the unknown and the known."

The first one is just like a general question, and then just the application of the question. So my first question is, do you think that consciousness and being-hood are inextricably linked? And then secondly, so if there something like a super-computer that one could house, theoretically, a perfect brain of a person in it, does that thing then become the same person as the person it was before. So is there a transcendency to being-hood but not to consciousness? Okay, so the first question is, well, I would say that the kind of being that these stories are concerned with is absolutely dependent on consciousness."

So it's always tricky when you ask is a, here's an example of meaning. Those are tricky questions because it depends on how you define the two. But for our purposes the being that we're discussing, that's represented in these stories, is intrinsically associated with conscious experience. And consciousness is given this constitutive role, the experience that we're talking about would not exist if consciousness did not exist. So you can think about it as sort of a game, in a way, and then you have to decide for yourself whether that's a game that can be generalized. And I won't answer the second part, okay? If you don't mind. [LAUGHTER] All right."

So I'll bring it next time and show it to you. My other question is, one of the main reasons why I'm interested in so much of your work and I think many are as well, is you leave literalism in the door and you open up another door to a much more deeper meaning. In your interview with Transliminal Media, you mentioned Liz [UNINTELLIGIBLE] book, the serpent, uh, the tree, the serpent... Yeah, yeah."

Snakes do.\" \"That's what it says in Genesis. What else gives you vision? Fruit. That's also right.\" \"That's why we have color vision. What makes you self-conscious if you're a man? Woman.

I mean there's only so much you can take seriously, and she did a fine job of what she did. But I'll talk about that a lot. That's a very complicated issue.

Based on your opinion of where the universities now stand in terms of humanities and social sciences, is mathematics more powerful than articulated speech? I'm not exactly sure how the first... Oh, well, it depends on what you mean by power, I guess. I mean, it's obvious that studying mathematics and computer science makes you insanely powerful. The question is: to what end? And I don't think that you can extract an answer to that from the study of mathematics. The humanities are there to ground people in proper citizen-hood. That's a way of thinking about it."

Yes, it has to be a tool of something. And what the humanities were for was to tell people what the tools should be used for. And so the tools themselves are crazily powerful.

It does in part. I know a good portrait artist, okay? And one of the things he pointed out about a great portrait is that it actually contains time. Because a photograph is one instant. But portrait is you layered on you, layered on you. So it's got a thickness. You know? And I think you can see that thickness in the original, but it's also a direct manifestation of that creative act of perception. I don't think you get that, you just can't get the fidelity of the original with the reproduction. But there's more to it than that too, because the painting doesn't end with the frame."

    "text": "[Music] so I've been thinking this week about doing this once a once a month on a continuing basis so so I I think if I do that I think it'll be here although it's harder to rent this theater during the academic year but if it isn't here it'll be somewhere else and because I'd like to continue doing this I'm learning an awful lot from doing it and and uh once a month would really be good because then I could really do the background work and and uh and I could probably do that for a couple of years because obviously this isn't going very quickly but that's okay you know I mean it shouldn't go any faster than it can go and that's how it that's how it seems to me anyways so uh this has been this has been a a very steep learning curve for me with regards to these stories because I didn't understand them very well and I've I've got better at using the resources online to help me do my background investigation I have a lot of books and some of you may have noticed that um online I posted a conversation I had with Jonathan pasio and his and his brother Matthew um I hope it's Matthew I named escaped me so badly but I believe that's right he just finished a book on the on the Bible and so I've been doing a lot of thinking and talking about these stories trying to understand what they're about and and then there's all these commentaries there's a a great site I think it's called Bible Hub that has every single verse of the Bible is listed there and then with each verse there are like they've aggregated 10 commentaries from about 10 commentaries from over the last 400 years and so there's like a dense page on every line and that's one of the things that's really interesting about this book too is that it's it's aggregated so much commentary that it's that it's it's much bigger than it looks the book is much bigger than it looks and so it's been very interesting to become familiar with those too and the fact that this site is set up with all the commentaries split up by verses means you can rapidly compare the commentaries and get a sense of you know how people have interpreted this over well at least several hundred years but of course much longer than that because the people who wrote the commentaries were of course reading things that were older than that so that's been very very interesting um so last week we talked about a couple of things we talked about how you might understand the idea of a Divine encounter and then we also paralleled that with the idea that God disappears in the Old Testament he he bows out as the stories progress and that seems to be a an emergent property of the sequencing of the the stories right because all the books were written by independent people different people and then they were aggregated by other people and so the narrative continuity is some kind of emergent property that's that's a consequence of this interaction between people readers and and writers over centuries and it's it's strange that given that there are also multiple coherent narratives that unite it you know it's really it's really not that easy to understand that but it does at least seem to be the case and so and the third thing we talked about was that as God bows out so to speak the the the the individual personality seems of the of the characters that are involved the human characters that are involved seems to become more and more developed and it isn't exactly clear what that I mean what it means is that God steps away and man steps forward that's what it means but why it's arranged like that or the or the say ultimate significance of that is by no means clear and so so Abraham who we're going to concentrate on today is quite a well-developed character um and I would say there are two there are multiple endings and Beginnings in the biblical Stories the most important ending I suppose is the ending of the of the garden of paradise and and the the disenchantment of the world and the and the sending forth of Adam and Eve into history right into the future into into a motive being that has a future as part of it and that has history as part of it and that has the necessity of sacrifice and toil as part of it that's obviously crucial and then that's that is replayed with the story of Noah because everything is destroyed and then the world is created a new and then sacrifices have to be made in order for the world to begin and then you see the same thing happen again after the Noah story in the Tower of Babel because history as we really understand history seems to start with Abraham because the stories of Abraham sound like historical stories and you know Scholars debate about the historical accuracy of the Bible and I suppose there's there's no way of ever determining once and for all the degree to which you might regard the the accounts as equivalent to Modern empirical history but this is a psychological interpretation of the biblical story is not a historical interpretation and it certainly does seem to be the case that from a psychological perspective we enter something like the domain of the modern conceptualization relatively modern conceptualization of history with Abraham beyond the of divine commands that Abraham carries out this is from fredman the man I mentioned in the last lecture who wrote The Disappearance of God and a variety of other books um that are well worth reading the narrative also includes a variety of stories in which Abraham acts on his own initiative he divides land with his nephew lot he battles Kings he takes concubines he argues with his wife Sarah on two occasion he tells kings that Sarah is his sister out of fear that they will kill him to get his wife he arranges his son's marriage in the place of the single story of Noah drunkenness there are in the case of Abraham the stories of a man's life and one of the things I was really struck by reading this in depth and reading the commentary is how much like a story about a person it is you know Abraham isn't a Divine figure in in any in in any archetypal sense precisely I mean he has archetypal elements because he's also obviously the founder of a Nation but fundamentally he's a human being and and he makes he has the adventures and he makes the mistakes of a human being and that's it's the mistake part that really struck me you know because I was talking with a friend of mine this week Norman dege uh who's a very remarkable person in many ways and he was taking me to task he was reading my book which I'm going to publish or which will be out in January and in in the book I I in one section I contrasted the god of the Old Testament with the god of the New Testament and made the case sort of based on northr Fry's ideas that the god of the Old Testament was really harsh and judgmental you know and that the god of the New Testament was more merciful and you know at least to some degree more sweetness and light and Norman took me to task about that saying that that was a an overly christianized interpretation which would make sense because I derived it in part from northr fry and I really have come to understand that more that that he's right because that he's right about that because the god in the Old Testament is actually far more merciful than he's generally made out to be and you really see see this with it's good news fundamentally if you regard the representation of God as somehow key to the description of being itself I mean Abraham makes a lot of mistakes you know serious mistakes and and yet he has a life and he's and he's blessed by God despite the fact that he's pretty deeply flawed and engages in deceptive practice I mean he's a good man but he's not a perfect man by any stretch of the imagination and and things work out really well for him and he's the founder of a nation and all of that and that's good news for everyone because perfect people are very very hard to find and if the the the the the only Pathway to having a rich and meaningful life was through Perfection then we would all be in deep trouble and so that that's very satisfying to read that and um the the other other thing that I've been struck by is that you know Abraham and I think this is actually absolutely key to the interpretation of the story Abraham goes out and does things that's the thing and so one of the things that I've noticed in my life is that nothing I've ever done was wasted and by done I mean put my heart and soul into you know like like attempted with with all of my effort that that always worked now it didn't always work the way I expected it to work that's a whole different issue but the payoff from it was always positive I always something always something of value always accured to me when I made the sacrifice is necessary to do something worthwhile and so I think part of the message in in this in the story of in the abrahamic stories is go do something and and I've I've thought about this in a variety of ways outside of the interpretation of this story because I have this program some of you might be familiar with which is called future authoring program and it's it's designed to help people make a plan for 3 to five years into the future you know and we so what you do is you you answer some questions it's a writing program you answer some questions about how you would like your life to be and what you would like your character to be 3 to 5 years down the road if you were taking care of yourself like you were taking care of someone that you actually cared about so you kind of have to split yourself into two people and treat yourself like you like someone you have respect for and that you want the best for that's not easy because people don't necessarily have respect for themselves and they don't necessarily want what's the best for themselves because they they have a lot of self-contempt and a lot of self-hatred a lot of guilt and a lot of existential angst and and a lot of self-consciousness and all of that and and so people don't necessarily take care of themselves very well and and I think it's I think it's I think you have an obligation it's one of the highest moral obligations to treat yourself as if you're a creature of value and and that is in some sense it's in some sense that's independent of your actions and you might think about that metaphorically as a recognition of your Divine worth in the biblical sense regardless of your of your sin so to speak and I think that's that's that's powerful language as far as I'm concerned once you understand it anyways with the self-authoring program the future authoring program you you ask you answer questions about what what how you would like your friendships to be conducted because it's useful to surround yourself with people who are trying to move forward and and more importantly who are happy when you move forward and not happy when you move back backwards not when you fall that isn't what I mean but when you're doing self-destructive things your friends shouldn't be there to cheer you on and because then they're really not acting like friends obviously you know I know it's obvious but it still happens all the time and people allow it to happen it's not a good idea and you know how would you like to sort your family out and I was thinking about this this week too because I was thinking about Noah's Arc and there was a phrase in that story that I didn't understand which was that Noah was perfect in his Generations I thought I don't know what that means and you know when you're when you're going through a book like the Bible if you don't understand a phrase that actually means you've missed something it doesn't mean that that's just not you know that's not gerine to the story it means you're stupid you didn't get it man you didn't get it you didn't understand it and so the idea that Noah was perfect in his generations and that's why he could build an ark that would sustain him and him and and Humanity itself through the flood it meant that he not only did he walk with God which was something that we talked about in in the context of The Sermon on the Mount but that he established proper relationships with his family with his children and so what that meant was that his Not only was he well integrated as a person but his level of integration had reached the point where it stretched out Beyond him and encompassed his family and so it was Noah and the family that was in the ark and I can tell you and I really understood this this year because I had a very tumultuous year you could think about it from a personal perspective I could think about it as a year that had no shortage of floods and my and part of the reason that I was able to get through it I also had terrible health problems and the only one of the reasons I was able to get through it was because my family really came together around me my kids my wife my parents and and and my friends as well and particularly a certain group of friends and that's partly all of that came together in my mind this week and I thought oh that's what it means to be perfect in his Generations meant that he hadn't just straightened himself out he'd also straightened out his relationships with his family and I can tell you that when crisis strikes you which it will it will the flood will come right that's why the apocalypse is always upon us the flood will definitely come in your life and to the degree that you've organized yourself psychologically and also healed the relationships between you and your family that could be the critical element that that determines whether you live or die when a crisis comes or or whether someone in your family lives or dies and so the idea of the the ark containing the man who's who walks with God and whose Generations are perfect and that that's what sustains Humanity through the crisis it's like you couldn't be more psychologically accurate than that you know the other thing I was thinking about this week I I was thinking about another line in the New Testament I think it's from The Sermon on the Mount but I'm not absolutely sure Christ compares the Kingdom of Heaven to a mustard seed and so I was thinking about a mustard seed is a very tiny seed and it grows into quite a spectacular complex plant and I was thinking about how you should operate in the world in order to make it a better place assuming that that's what you should be doing and that that is what you should be doing and there there's lots in the world to fix everything that bothers you about the world and about yourself should be fixed and you can do that and my Dawning realization I have a friend he lives in Montreal his name is James Simon he's a great painter and he's taught me a lot of things help he's helped me design my house and beautify it and I bought some paintings from him a couple of years ago um and he did this series of paintings where he went around North America and and stood in different places and then he painted the view from here down and so it's his feet planted in different places on roads in the desert on the ocean I have one actually hanging over my toilet which is him standing at a urinal um yeah well you know he was trying to make a point and the point was that wherever you are it's worth paying attention and that's because you know so all these places that he visited he looked exactly where he was standing by the side of the road in the desert sort of mundane in some sense but then maybe he put 40 hours into that that painting you know and it's it's very very realistic painting with really good light and what he's telling you as a painter is everything is worth paying attention to an infinite amount but you don't have enough time and so the artist does that for you right the artist looks and looks and looks and looks and looks and then gives you that vision and so then you can look at the painting and it reminds you that right where you are is there's every everything that there is is right where you are and that's a hard thing to realize but it's actually true and so I've I've been telling people online in various ways and in lectures that they should start fixing up the World by cleaning up their room and I wanted to just elaborate on that a little bit before I get back to the lecture itself so as it's become this internet weird internet meme you know uh and and and and and it's a joke and good it's a joke I good I'm really happy about the fact that so much of this has got like the leave-in of humor and it's really important because that's what stops things from degenerating into into conflict to humor and I was thinking about this idea of cleaning up your room in relationship to the Mustard Seed idea and you see the thing about cleaning up your room this is also something I learned from Carl Jung and his studies on Alchemy because for Yung when The Alchemist was attempting to make the philosopher stone he was not only engaged in the transformation of the material world but he was engaged in a process of self- transformation that occurred at the same time as the as the chemical trans as the chemical transformation so it's a psychological work in some sense let's say you want to sort out your room and beautify it because the beauty is also important and let's say that all you have is just a little room like you're not rich you're you're poor and and you don't have any power that's another thing but you've got your damn room and you've got this space right in front of you you know that that that's a part of the cosmos that you can come to grips with and you might think well what's there in front of you right in front of you and the answer to that is it depends on how open your eyes are that's the proper answer because you could say and William Blake said this for example and eldis Huxley made comments that were very similar that in a Transcendent State you can see Infinity in the finite and you might say well you can say in you can see infinity and what you have within your grasp if you look and you could say maybe that's the case with your room and so you want to clean up your room well okay how do you do that exactly well a room is a room is a place to sleep and so if you set your room up properly then you figure out how to sleep and when you should sleep and you should sleep and then you figure out when you should wake up and then you figure out well what clothes you should wear because they have to be arranged properly in your dresser and then you have to have some place to put your clothes if you're going to have some clothes you have to figure out what you're going to wear those clothes to do right and then that means you have to figure out what you're going to do and then your room has to serve that purpose because otherwise it isn't set up properly and if it doesn't set up if it doesn't serve your per purposes you will be unhappy and not happy in the room because the way that we perceive the world is as a place to move from point A to point B in and then if the place that we're in facilitates that movement then we're happy to be there and if the place that we're in serves as an obstacle to that movement then we're unhappy to be there and so what it means to set up your room is that you have to have somewhere to go that's worthwhile or you can't set up your room and then your room has to be set up to facilitate that and then the next thing is well maybe you have to make it beautiful but that's not easy right that means you have to have some taste and that doesn't mean you have to have money it doesn't because you can be garish with money and you can be tasteful with nothing all you need is taste and taste beats money when it comes to beautifying things you know I mean not that money is Trivial because it's not but taste is crucial and people who are very artistically oriented can make beautiful things out of virtually nothing and not only that the literature suggests that if you're going to make beautiful things putting real constraints on on what you allow yourself to do facilitates creativity instead of inter interfering with it because let's say you have to make something out of nothing right which I suppose would be a Godly act right you have to make something out of nothing it you have to be creative in order to do that and so then to to beautify your room means that you also have to develop Your Capacity to be creative and so then you can make your room shine but then what will happen is that if your family isn't together they will interfere with that you'll interfere with that because you won't have the discipline to do it properly but then when you start building this this this little microcosm of perfection with what you have at hand then it'll evoke all the pathologies of everyone in your household they'll wonder what the hell you're up to in there and they won't necessarily be happy because if you're if they're in a lowly Place let's say and so are you and you're trying to move out of that then the the higher you move out of that the more the place they're in looks bad and you might say well what they should do is celebrate your victory over chaos and evil but that isn't what will happen what will happen instead is that will attempt to pull you back down they'll attempt to and I mean obviously All Families don't do that but but all families do that to some degree and some families do almost nothing but that and so what that means is that if you're going to organize your room then you're going to have to confront the devils in your house and that's often that's often a terrifying thing because some of those Devils have have lineages that go back many many many generations and God only knows what you have to struggle with in order to overcome that and so and then and so to sort yourself out and to fix up your room is a non-trivial matter you know and you you can do that you'll learn by doing that and then maybe you'll learn Enough by doing that so that you can fix up your family a little bit and then having done that you'll have enough character so that when you try to operate in the world at your job or maybe in the broader social spheres that you'll be a force for good instead of harm because you'll have learned some humility by noting just how difficult it was to put your damn room together well and yourself for that matter and so you'll proceed cautiously with your eyes open towards the good and so well I those are some of the things I've been thinking about this week and they're germine they're like they're Germain to what we're going to discuss tonight because what happens at the beginning of the abrahamic story is basically God comes to Abraham and just says go get going man do something do something get going and you might think well where should I go and God God is somewhat vague about that and where he sends Abraham it's it's a real fixer upper man it's like there's starvation there and and there's tyranny and there's and there's marital dissolution and there's deceit like it's it's just like where you live you know it's exactly the same thing it's it's it's tyranny and catastrophe so that's you know the the great the tyrannical great father because because Abraham ends up having to sojourn in Egypt and and there's a famine and so mother nature is on the Rampage Abraham lies about his wife as we'll see and so it's it's the world it's the world it's tyranny and and vulnerability and deceit and yet God says go because if you do go then you'll become a father of Nations and you think well again that's pretty good news although it's strange because you'd expect that if God chose Abraham then he'd send him immediately to the land of Honey land of milk and honey and that isn't what happens at all it doesn't happen at all and Abraham never gets there but his mission is still regarded as Divine and thank God for that because that's what your mission will be because that's what you will encounter in your life those are the AR archetypal things everyone encounters the tyranny of the social structure and the and the rapaciousness of Nature and the deceitful the deceitful quality of the human psyche it's like that's the world now it's a negative that's a negative view in some sense but it's positive in the story because what it basically says is something that's akin to The Sermon on the Mount which is that if you're aligned with God and you pay attention to the Divine injunction then you can operate in the midst of chaos and tyranny and deception and flourish and you could hardly hope to have a better piece of news than that given that that's exactly where you are so and I didn't see any of that in the abrahamic stories to begin with so it's been very interesting to have that sort of reveal itself the Abraham section thus develops the personality and character of a man to a new degree in bibl narrative while picturing him in a new degree of responsibility in him a new degree of responsibility so here's the other thing that's really struck me and I think this is of absolutely crucial importance and I I don't know how much importance but it's certainly important to me one of the things that has just blown me away in the last year because I've talked to lots of people lots of people live you know but also lots of people online but it's more obvious live and it's obvious in this theater as well is that I I've i' I've gone around and spoken and a large proportion of my audience has been young men y you know under 30 something like that and I've spoken to them a lot about responsibility and what's so odd about about this is that of all the things that I've spoken about because I can see the audience and I can feel how the audience is reacting because I'm always paying attention to all of you in so far as I can manage that so I I get some sense of how what I'm saying is Landing you know which you have to do if you're going to speak effectively to people and what what happens is if I talk about responsibilities everyone be is silent just like they are now silent and and not moving right focusing attentive say pick up your responsibility pick up the heaviest thing you can and carry it and the room goes quiet and everybody's eyes open and I think that always makes me break up I was [Applause] I don't I don't know why I was speaking to an English journalist today who's going to write an article in ins spectator magazine and I was talking about this and at the same point in the discussion the same I had the same emotional reaction I don't really understand it it's I think it's something there's something about it that's so crucial because you know we've been fed this unending diet of Rights and freedoms and there's something about that especially there's something about that that's so pathologically wrong and people are starving for the antidote and the antidote is truth and responsibility right and it it isn't it isn't because that's what you should do in some you know in some some I know better or someone knows better for you what you should do sense it's that it's that it's that it's that that's the secret to a meaningful life and without a meaningful life then all you have is suffering and and nihilism and despair and all of that and self-contempt and and that's not good and so the men it's necessary for men to stand up and take responsibility and they all know that and and are starving for that message and and the message is more that that's also a good thing to stand up and take responsibility because you're cursed so much now from from from from when you're young with this notion that your active engagement with the world is part of what is destroying and undermining the planet and adding to the tyranny of the social systems it's like how about not so much of that hey because it's it's it's too Soul deadening it's anti-human right to the core and my sense instead is that you know if you if you were able to reveal the best of yourself to you in the world that you would be an overwhelming Force for good and that whatever errors might be made along the way would wash out in the works and that's the other thing that you see in the abrahamic stories because Abraham is not a perfect person by any stretch of the imagination he's a real person and he makes mistakes but it doesn't matter the overarching narrative is you know maintain your Covenant with God and despite your inadequacies then not only will you Prevail but your descendants will prevail it's like great that's really good news you know so it's been really something to see that in the in the stories it's not that so that's responsibility it's not just that Abraham is Kinder gentler more intrepid ethical or a better debater than his ancestor Noah rather both the Noah and Abraham stories are pieces of a development of an increasingly stronger stance of humans relative to the deity before the story is over humans will become a good deal stronger and Bolder than Abraham well that's really something to say because Abraham is pretty bold so we'll let's read the stories the first one is about Abraham Sarah and lot now these are the generations of Tara Tara begat Abraham so his name is Abraham to begin with and that actually turns out to be important it's not Abraham nahor and Heron and Heron begat lot so Heron is Abram's brother and Heron died before his father Tara in the land of his Nativity in ER of the chelis and Abram and nahor took them wives the name of Abram's wife was Sarai and the name of nahor's wife milka the daughter of Heron the father of milka and the father of isca but Sarai was Barren she had no child and Tara took Abram his son and lot the son of Heron his son's son and Sarai his daughter-in-law his son Abram's wife and they went forth with them from the ER of chelis from ER of the chelis to go into the land of Canaan that's Exile and they came unto Heron and dwelt there and the days of Tera were 205 years and terara died in Heron and there's a reason that Sarah is is introduced as Barren and and it's it's to set the stage I think it was Anton COV who when he was talking about this the stage setting for a play that if there was a rifle hanging on the wall then it had better been used before I believe the second act or it shouldn't be hanging there at all right and so this is stage setting and I part of the reason that the biblical writers are pointing out that Abram's wife is Barren is because it's a real catastrophy for Abraham and for Sarah as well that she's Barren and so it's it's showing the trouble that Abraham's in at the beginning of the story and it's also it's also see what happens as the story progresses is that Abraham Abraham and Sarah are eventually granted a son but it's way late in the story and they're very very old by the time it happens and of course you're not going to be a father of Nations without having a child and so the the writers are attempting to to make the case that if you forthrightly pursue that which God directs you to pursue let's say that all things are possible that's that's the idea in the narrative and you know you you might say that's naive and you know it it's not it you think it when you're naive right and then you dispense with that idea and then when you stop being the sort of person who dispenses with ideas then you come to another place and that's the place where you think you have no idea what might be possible for you if you if you got things together and pursued what you should pursue you don't know how much what's impossible to you right now would become possible under those conditions it's an unknown phenomena and like I've watched people who put themselves together across time you know incrementally and continually and they become capable of things that are jaw not only jaw-droppingly amazingly but also sometimes metaphysically impossible to understand and so we don't know the limits of human endeavor we truly don't and it it's it's premature to put a cap on what it is that we are what that what it is that we're capable of and so you you know you're already something and maybe you're not so bad in your current configuration but you might wonder if you did nothing for the next 30 Years except put yourself together just exactly what would you be able to do and you might think well that's worth finding out but of course that's that's the adoption of responsibility and one thing I've also learned over the years because I've been curious about this battle between meaning and nihilism you know and I mean I mean I could see for a long while the rationale in nihilism and and the power of the nihilistic argument but it it it occurred to me across across time that despite that the power of the nihilistic argument is more powerful than naive optimism but it's not more powerful than the optimism that is not naive because the optimism that is not naive says it's self-evident that the world is a place of suffering and that there are things to be done about that and it's self-evident that people are flawed and that there's things to be done about that and then The non-naive Optimist says the suffering could be reduced and the insufficiency could be overcome if people oriented themselves properly and did what they were capable of doing and I do not believe that that's deniable I I do I do I think that human potential is virtually Limitless and that there's nothing perhaps that's beyond our grasp if we're careful as individuals and as a society and so I think that there's no reason for nihilism and there's no reason for hopelessness and and there's no reason to bow down before evil because we're capable of so much more and I think that you can easily you know that first because you're not happy with who you are and you're ashamed and embarrassed about it as you should be and you know it because if you look out there you see people who are capable of doing great things and you know that we're not giving at our all and still we're not doing so badly you know and so you you might wonder if if if we devoted 90% of our effort to putting things right instead of 55% of our effort or maybe even less than that you might wonder just how well could things be put together and I think that you can figure that out by starting with your room by the way and the Lord said unto Abram and this is this is the this is the opening of the story get thee out of thy country and from thy Kindred and from thy Father's House unto a land that I will show thee and this is one of those phrases where every Clause is significant go somewhere you don't understand that's the first thing get thee out of thy country you know back in the 1920s there was a whole slew of American Writers who ended up as exp Patriots in Paris Hemingway among them and and who wrote The Great Gatsby Fitzgerald yes and then a variety of others it was very inexpensive in Paris at the time and part of their transformation into great literary figures was the fact that they were out of their country and now they could see what their country was because you can't see what your country is until you leave it so you have to go into the unknown and that's that's God's First Command go into the unknown because you already know what you know and so and that's not enough unless you think you're enough and if you're not enough and you don't think you're enough then you have to go where you haven't been and so that's the first commandment to Abraham it's like okay that that's a good one that makes perfect sense go to where you don't know yes and from th Kindred well that what does that mean it means grow up right that's what it means it means get away from your family enough so that you can establish your Independence and that isn't because there's something wrong with your family although perhaps there is you know as there is perhaps wrong with you but it means get away you know I talk to people very frequently whose families have provided them with too much protection and they know it themselves and that means they're deprived of necessity you know one of the things that you see in in in the United States for example is that um the children of first generation immigrants often do better than the CH than the than their children and the reason for that is that the children of first generation IM immigrants have necessity driving them and you don't know how much you need necessity to drive you because maybe you're not very disciplined and if a catastrophe doesn't immediately befall you if you don't act forthrightly today then maybe you never act forthrightly right because the the the gap between your foolishness and the punishment is is lengthened by your unearned wealth and so you never grow up and learn and you have to get yourself away from your dependency in order to allow necessity to drive you forward and that's to become independent and to become mature and I think part of what's happening in our culture is that the the the force that's attacking the the forthright movement forward of young men in particular is afraid of the power of men because it's confused about the distinction between power and authority and competence like a man who's who has Authority and competence has power as a byproduct but the authority and competence is everything and and and people who can't understand that fail to make the distinction between power and authority of competence and they're afraid of power and so they destroy Authority and competence and that's a terrible thing because we need Authority and competence what else is going to what else is going to allow us to Prevail in the long run and so you get away from your country and you get away from your kin and from your father's house right and you go out there and you establish yourself in the world it's a call to Adventure that's what this the the first lines in the abrahamic story is a call to Adventure so great unto a land that I will show you well you know what does that mean you know what one of the things that I've been struck very hard by a number of writers Carl Jung obviously among them I mean he he wrote things like nature that if you understand them they just break you into pieces you know and and one of the things that Yung understood in the psychoanalysts understand it's one of the most terrifying elements of psychoanalytic thinking it's very tightly allied with religious thinking which is that you are not the master of your own house there are spirits that dwell in you within you meaning you have a will and you can exercise a certain amount of conscious control over your being but there are all sorts of things that occur within that seem to be Beyond Your Capacity to control your dreams for example that's a really good example or your impulses for example you you might think of those as so foreign from you that they're not even you don't even want them to be part of you but but more subtly even how about what you're interested in what compels you like where does that come from exactly because you can't you can't conjure it up of your own accord you know so if you're a student and you're taking difficult course you might say to yourself well I need to sit down and study for 3 hours but then you sit down and that isn't what happens your attention goes everywhere and you might say well whose attention is it then if it goes everywhere because you say it's your attention it's like well if it's your attention maybe you would be able to control it but you can't and so then you might think well J just exactly what the hell is controlling it and you might say well it's random it's well it better not be random I can tell you that that's that happens to some degree in schizophrenia there's an element of Randomness in that it's not random it's driven by the action of of phenomena that I think are best considered as something like subpersonalities although even that's only a partial description you can't make yourself interested in something interest manifests itself and grips you that's a whole different thing and so what is it that's gripping you and and how do you conceptualize that is that a divine power well it's divine as far as you're concerned because it grips you and you can't do anything about it and so there's a calling in you towards what you're compelled by and what you're interested in and sometimes that might be very dark and sometimes not but you're compelled forward by your interest and so and so the idea that what moves you away from your country and your father's house and the Comforts of your childhood home is is something that's beyond you and that you listen to and hearken to that's exactly right and you can say well I don't want to call that God it's like it doesn't matter what you call it exactly it doesn't matter to what it is what it's called it's still is and if you don't listen to it that's the other thing if you don't listen to it and I've been a clinician and talked to enough people now as old as I am to know this absolutely if you do not listen to that thing that beckons you forward you will pay for it like you cannot possibly imagine you'll have everything that's terrible about life in your life and nothing about it that's good and worse you'll know that it was your fault and that you squandered what you could have had so this is not only a calling forth but a warning unto a land that I will show thee and and that's it that I will show thee that and you don't want to be too concrete about this you know there's all sorts of new territories that you can inhabit if you there's there's abstract and conceptual territories if you go to university and you study biology or you study Physics or or any discipline you're in territory right you're in the territory that all the scholars have established and then as you master the discipline you move out beyond the established territory into the unknown and and that's a new land right maybe it's even a land of your enemies for that matter but it's a new land the frontier is always in front of you and so you know when the Earth was less inhabited than it is now the frontier was the psychological Frontier and the geographical Frontier was the same thing and now they've separated to some degree because there's not so much geographical Frontier but there's the Frontier is a place that never disappears and the land that's beyond the land that you know is always there and it's always where you should go and all of that's packed into these what four phrases so well so when I've been thinking about narrative you look at the world through a story you can't you can't help it and this the story is what gives value to the world or or the story is what you extract from the value of the world you can look at it either way you're somewhere and it's not good enough right that's the Eternal human predicament wherever you are isn't good enough and to some degree that's actually a good thing because if it was good enough well there's nothing for you to do so it's actually maybe a good thing that it's insufficient and that might be why sometimes having less is is better than having more and and I don't want to be a poana about that I mean I know that there's deprivation that can reach to the point where it's no where it's completely counterproductive but it isn't always the case that starting with little is you if you start with little you start with more possibility it's something like that so you move from always from what's unbearable about the present to some better future right and if you don't have that then you have no you have nothing but threat and and negative emotion you have no positive emotion because the positive emotion is generated in the conception of the better future and then the evidence that you generate yourself that you're moving towards it that's where the positive and fulfilling meaning of life comes so you want to set up this structure properly it's very very important and so what it means is that you want to be going somewhere that's good enough so that the going is worth the while and you can ask yourself that and that's partly what we tried to build into the future authoring program which is well we know what's wrong with life it's rif with suffering and insufficiency and deception and evil it's all of that obviously okay what would make the journey worthwhile well you can ask yourself that it's like all right in order to Bear up under this load what is it that I would need to be striving to attain and if you ask yourself that that's to knock and and the door will open that's what that means if you ask yourself that then you will find an answer and you'll think you'll shrink away from it you'll think well there's no way I could do that it's like well you don't know what you could do you don't know what's possible and you're not as much as you could be and so God only knows what you could what you could do and have and give if you sacrificed everything to it it and that's the reason Abraham is constantly making sacrifices and it's archaic right he's burning up like baby lambs but like well they're alive you know that's something and and they're valuable and that's something it's you have to admit even if you think about it as a modern person that the act of sacrificing something might have some dramatic compulsion to it you know to go out into a flock and to take something that's newborn and to cut its throat and to bleed it and to burn it might be a way of indicating to yourself that you're actually serious about something and it isn't so obvious that we have rituals of seriousness like that now and so it's not so obvious that we're actually serious about anything and so maybe that's not such a good thing and so maybe we shouldn't be thinking that these people were so archaic and primitive and superstitious it's possible that they knew something that we don't and certainly in the abrahamic stories one of the things that maintains Abraham's Covenant with God is his continual willingness to sacrifice it's so that sacrificial issue is so important because you are not committed to something unless you're willing to sacrifice for it commitment and sacrifice are the same thing and I think it's it borders on miraculous that those concepts are embedded into this narrative at the level of dramatic action you know instead of abstract explanation people are acting this out and then the the fundamental conception is so profound that it's really quite it's quite a inspiring it's it's breathtaking really when you understand what message is trying to be invade you have to make sacrifices what do you have to sacrifice you have to sacrifice that which is most valuable to you currently that's stopping you and God only knows what that is it's certainly the worst of you it's certainly that and God Only Knows to what degree you're in love with the worst of you so well so you move from the unbearable present to the ideal future and and you can't help that you have to live in a structure like that that's your house that's another way of thinking about it then if you want to get your house in order and if you want it to be a place that you can live properly then you have to plan the future that is perfect and then I think well what does that mean and it means it's good for you right and one of the things that I I'm I do all the time with my clinical and Consulting clients is try to figure out what would be good for them but we we do more than that we try to think okay well what how can we set this up so it's really good for you and that all the side consequences of that are things that are good for other people and so because people are often also timid about trying to get something that's good for themselves because they feel that it's selfish or that they don't deserve it so we set it up so that well look we're going to set it up so that it's plainly obvious that this will not harm the structure of the universe for you to have what you need and to do it in a way that's of benefit to other people there's no downside to that and and so it's okay it's okay if you reach out and take that and one of the things that's interesting about the biblical Stories the abrahamic stories as well is that God doesn't really seem to be opposed to the success of the people that he's chosen you know what happens to them is as they progress through their journey is they they get larger flocks and they they get more Authority and they they get they get more they get life more abundant that's what happens it's God isn't doesn't seem to be a miser in the Old Testament it's like if you put in the and you and you accept the Covenant and you make the sacrifices then you get to be successful and maybe successful beyond your wildest dreams and that that's actually seems to be okay with God and that's pretty cool given that you know that that General notion of Old Testament God is that all he's doing is casting out curses and death you know wherever he happens to wander and I mean there's certainly no shortage of that but but again it seems to me that that's very good news and that you also don't have to be perfect in order for have that happen and then the other thing this is the issue about going into the unknown it's like well if you leave your country and your kin and your father's house and you go out into a land that your intuition guides you to you're going to undergo these radical Transformations this is a sacrificial transformation too because you're you're moving forthrightly and voluntarily into chaos right and that's the same as the dragon fight that's the hero's story and what will happen there is that you will transform yourself and so the call to an ideal is also the call to a sequence of deaths and rebirths that move you closer and closer to the ideal and that's what that's what God is calling Abraham to do in the first sentence of this story you see these things echoed in the strangest places and so the SE are Stills that I took from Pinocchio and this little Cricket so he the still Small Voice right that's the thing that calls to you it's your conscious conscience in part it's your intuition in part and it's the thing that opens up the Great Book of the world the great Sacred Book of the world and that's what happens here right and the animators are at pains to show you that it's a leatherbound book with guilt lettering it's a valuable book and it's something that's quiet that's showing it to you right you have to meditate let's say you have to be somewhere where the world is drowning you out in order to understand how to open this to listen to that voice that tells you where you should go what what you should do next and then what happens is that something beckons to you in the night it's a star right it's something that transcends the Horizon it's it's Glitters it's it's brilliant it's it's not day-to-day it's something that's beyond you it's something that represents a Transcendent ideal and that makes it manifest to you if you're quiet enough to listen and that's what you wish upon so strangely right and people do that they wish upon a star they teach their children that and they don't know why why what do you mean you wish upon a star what what in the world does that mean it means you lift your eyes to the heavens and make a pact with the transcendant and then your and then what your heart's desire will come to you that's what it means and you think well that's so that's not naive it's the most sophisticated thing that you can know and it's the birth of the hero right because that's the that's the Nativity star obviously and this is where it takes place it's just anywhere and the person in it is just a carpenter and a toy maker but that's pretty good a carpenter if you're a deceitful Carpenter then your house falls down and if you're a toy maker then you love children it's that's a good start you know so so jepetto who lives in this little it's it's it's a it's not a grand house it's it's it's just everyday house but everything that's happening in it is good and so that means it's it's a palace because everything in it is H that's happening is good there's a saying and I I don't remember where it comes from that it's better to have bread and water in peace than a feast in conflict and like that's not a saying that's just the starkest possible description of the truth because there's nothing worse than eating a grand meal with people you hate and despise that are at each other's throats it's much better to have bread and water in peace it's it's it's it's not it's it's just clearheaded analysis of the structure of the world to say things like that and so the magical transformation can happen in the most mundane of places because and the reason for that is that the mundane nature of places is an illusion because every place is the potential birthplace of the kingdom of God that's the case and so japeto he's a good guy he has a kitten you know the kitten likes them he makes puppets and he's humble person and he knows that compared to the ideal that he's attempting to subscribe to that he's he's not a based before it or anything like that he's not despicable in relationship to it but the reason he's on his knees is because the thing he's pointing at is above him you know if it wouldn't be the right aim if it wasn't above him and so the fact that he's on his knees so to speak is only an indication that his is proper because you should be on your knees to something that you actually admire and if you don't feel like being on your knees in front of it then perhaps you don't actually admire it and then that means you haven't got the stage set properly it could be it should be something that fills you with awe your aim should should be at something that fills you with awe because what why why do something else well perhaps because it's easy and perhaps because it's malevolent and all of those things but but those are no answer to the problems that beset you they just make things worse and that's clear and so then jedo have having made his pact his Covenant just like Abraham he falls into a dream right he falls into a dream and the rest of the movie actually takes place in a dream and it's a Dream It's The Dream Within which transformation takes place and that's laid out at least in part time stops in in in the Pinocchio story and everything happens to Pinocchio in some sense in a land that's outside of normal time and that's that's the infinite archetypal space that's a real place that's a real place the infinite and the finite coexist and most of the time we're in the place of the finite but that doesn't mean that the place of the infinite doesn't exist it just means that we can't get access to it we just get intimations of it from time to time you know when things are going perfectly well for you on those rare occasions where everything comes together for the brief moment you inhabit that Divine place and you have some sense of what your life could be like if you organized it from the smallest element to the largest element and that's a place that you can inhabit if not forever in a manner that at least felt like forever well because of jepetto's decision the Transcendent manifests itself it takes the form of the Blue Fairy here that's the positive element of nature right so we could say well nature it's not so clear that she's or your side right she's the Red Queen in Ellison Wonderland who runs around screaming when you go down the rabbit hole she runs around screaming off with their heads and who says In My Kingdom you have to run as fast as you can just to stay in the same place that's mother nature but then we might say well how do we know that Mother Nature's attitude towards you isn't negative because your attitude towards things isn't proper and that's what this film attempts to indicate the idea is that if you aim properly then nature aligns itself behind you now it also arrays itself in front of you perhaps even as an antagonist but the power that it it it provides you with from within might be sufficient to overcome it from without and I think that I think that the clinical evidence is clear about that because one of the things that we do know is that if you take people who are confronting terrible things and shrinking from them and you teach them how to structure their behavior so that they can advance with courage everything works better for them their fears decrease and their character grows and so there might be enough of nature within us to help us withstand the nature that's outside of us and it depends at least to some degree on how it is that we Orient ourselves in the world to some in to some unknowable degree now jepetto wants an autonomous individual as a son and that's also something that makes him a great person because autonomous individuals have their own will and if you're a tyrant it's the last thing that you're going to want and if you're the Tyrant who's jealous of his son it's even more so the last thing you're ever going to want and so to aim high and to want the development of the autonomous individual are the same thing and I would say that's the core story in some sense of the of Western culture is that to aim high and to develop the autonomous individual are the same thing and that's what happens in Pinocchio that's what happens in the story of Abraham and the transformation takes place the magical transformation and in the Pinocchio story one of the things that's so interesting about it and this is part of its mythological substructure from the scientific perspective there's only two determining forces with regards to the destiny of the individual there's nature deterministic and culture deterministic and then Scholars Wrangle about which of those is the greater force but in mythological stories there's always a third element and that third element is something like autonomous Consciousness and there's no place for autonomous Consciousness in the deterministic story of Nature and culture but we all act as if autonomous Consciousness is the primary reality and the biblical stories are predicated on the idea that autonomous Consciousness is what gives rise to the world and I don't think that we're in a position to presume that that is necessarily an error and so what that means is to aim high and to develop the autonomous individual is is simultaneously the decision to formulate an allegiance with the the conscious power that brings being into existence and that all takes place inside this little puppet and then he has his adventures right he's he's he's still half jackass and half deceptive but he still despite that and despite all the errors he has the capacity to move forward and to transform into something to transform himself into something that can be properly considered described as a true Son of God and that's the right aim and it works like this as far as I can tell you know when I had talked to people about doing the future authoring program they often put it off and it's not surprising because it's hard and and but it's more than that they think well I don't know how to write I'm going to do a bad job I don't really like assignments I'm going to have to do it perfectly I need to wait till I have enough time and like one of those is enough to stop your cold and all five of them you're just done and so I tell people do it halfhazard a tiny bit at a time and badly because you can do that I tell my students when they're doing their thesis Master's thesis write a really bad first draft and then we have a little conversation about that because they don't think I mean that because it sounds like a cliche in some sense it's not a cliche it's not a cliche at all it means you're a terrible writer but but if someone put a gun to your head and said you have to have your 100 page thesis done by next Monday or I'll shoot you but I don't care how terrible it is you would sit down and write it and the thing is then you have it right then then you have something and then you can fix it you can iterate and fix it that bad first draft that's the most valuable thing and so that's what you need you need a bad first draft of yourself and there's there's an idea that Jung developed about the trickster and the jester the comedian right that the the trickster is the precursor to the Savior that's one of the things I learned from Yung that was just it's so unlikely you never think that it's so amazing that that might be the case but the the the the the SAT the satirical and the ironic and the and the Troublemaker the the comedian the fool the fool is the precursor to the Savior why because you're a fool when you start something new and so if you're not willing to be a fool then you'll never start anything new and if you never start anything new then you won't develop and so the willingness to be a fool is the precursor to transformation and that's the same as humility and so if you're going to write your destiny you can do a bad first job you're going to get smarter As you move forward that's the thing is that so something beckons to you that's what happens here maybe the star that jepetto wished on was the wrong damn star but at least it was a star right at least it was in the sky at least it moved him forward and so you say in your life well something grips you and and and fills you with interest and you think well should I do that and the answer is if not that then something' what if it's a mistake it's a mistake rest assured what do you know you're going to stumble around right and what's going to happen is this you're going to move to you're going to not stay in stasis you're not going to wander around in circles and I see people like that they said well I never knew what to do and now I'm 40 it's like that's not so good that's not so good and you might say well and there is a literature too that suggests that people are a lot more unhappy when they look back on their lives about the things they didn't do than they are about the mistakes they made while they were doing things and so that's really worth thinking about too because there's Redemptive mistakes and a Redemptive mistake would be a mistake that you make when you go out and try to do something you know you actually you think okay I'm going to try to do this and you're not good at it you make a bunch of mistakes it's like what what's the consequence if you pay attention is you're not quite so stupid anymore that's the thing is you've been informed by your by the results of your errors and so what happens is you you you follow the beacon you follow the light and and you're blind so you don't know where the light is it's it's dimly apprehended only and you're afraid to follow it but you decide to take some stumbling steps towards it and as you take stumbling steps towards it you become illuminated and enlightened and informed because of the nature of your experience because you're pushing yourself Beyond where you are and you're going into the country that you have not yet been in and you learn something and so what happens then is the star moves you move 10t towards it and you think no that's not right I didn't get it right it isn't there it's actually there and so then you you see it somewhere else and you shift yourself slightly and you move forward and that's what happens is that you continue as you change the thing that guides you forward moves right it's like God in the in the in the desert in Egypt the pillar of light that you're following it's moving it's not a permanent thing you move towards it it moves away it guides you forward and so you say well is what I'm aiming at Paradise itself and the answer to that is no because what do you know you you couldn't see Paradise if it was right in front of you but you might get a glimmer of it and so you move towards it and you grow and then the next time you open your eyes you see a little bit more clearly and that's what happens is that just happens over and over right it keeps moving and so you move like this but the thing that's so cool is that all those zigs and zags you say and each of those zags is and zigs is a catastrophy I hit a wall my God and then I had to die a little bit and I barely got back up it's a phoenix transformation at each at each turn and it's painful but the thing is is that even though you've you've traveled 20 miles let's say on that road and you've only moved three miles forward you've moved three miles forward instead of falling backwards because that's the thing too is that if you stand still you fall backwards you cannot stand still because the world moves away from you if you stand still and there's no stasis there's only backwards and so if you're not moving backward back forwards then you're moving backwards and that's more more of the underlying truth of of the Matthew principle to those who have everything more will be given from those who have nothing everything will be taken taken it's a warning do not stay in one place well as you Zig and zag maybe the maybe the cataclysm of each transformation starts to lessen there's not so much of you that has to die with every mistake and maybe you end up oriented at least reasonably properly and if you were sensible that would have been your trip but it wasn't right it's that and perhaps it's a lot worse than that perhaps per there's no shortage of backtracking but it doesn't matter because as you stumble forward you you illuminate and inform yourself and perhaps that's partly because the world is made of information and if you encounter it and Tangle with it then it informs you and then you become informed and then you're information and then you're ready and so God says to Abraham I will make of thee a great name and I will bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing that's that's a good offer fundamentally I mean it means what does it mean to to be made a great nation of well perhaps it has something to do directly with your descendants but I don't think it's just that you know is if you're a force for good in the world then that radiates out from you and if you good enough it's difficult to say how much of an impact on things you could have you know dovi who is a very crazy person partly because of his epilepsy he said a man is not only responsible for everything he does but for everything that everyone else does and you think well no no no and yes sometimes no sometimes that's what you think if you're cataclysmic cataclysmically depressed right is that your sins are so egregious that that they're unforgivable and that in some manner you're at you're at fault for everything that's terrible with the world but there's actually truth in that and there's actually Redemptive truth in that is that things wouldn't be so bad if you weren't so if you weren't so far from what you could be and that's terribly pessimistic because it's all on you man but it's terribly optimistic because God there's a lot of things that you could do and if you're crying out for something to do then that's the best news you could possibly have it's like things aren't so good but neither are you so if you stop doing the things that you knew to be destructive which is the right place to start you know if you're going to clean up your room what do you do first well you just get rid of the mess you know and you know what not no one has to come in and tell you hopefully what's the worst mess it's just it announces itself to you and you can certainly know yourself and this is a very easy meditative exercise to sit down and think okay I'm doing one thing really stupidly that I should stop doing it's like how long is it going to take you to figure out what that is it's about two seconds right you've known it forever and you could even make it less demanding you could say there are some stupid things that I'm doing that I know are stupid and wrong that I could stop doing that I would stop doing and then you can just start with that and you can just do that and maybe it's just a little thing although it's not because it's it's a it's a step forward on the proper Voyage it's not a small thing and you think well what would happened you could say let's do this for a year or even a month just try not to do things you know to be stupid and wrong for a month and that means not to say things you know to be stupid and wrong as well maybe that's the most important thing just do it as an experiment see what happens and it's so fun because I have people writing to me from all over the world who are saying they're doing that they're saying well you know I cleaned up my room and and then I stopped saying stupid things and my God it's like things are way better it's like who would have guessed it you know and so it's lwh hanging fruit man because there's a that's the other thing if there's a lot of things wrong with you then it's it's really easy to start fixing it you know you got so much there's so much territory that you can inhabit I will make of thee a great nation I Will Bless thee that's good I mean the whole nation thing that's positive but to have God on your side that's you know you might want that when things get rough that would be good and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing wonderful that's a good deal and I will bless them that bless thee that's good too and curse him that curseth thee and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed that's something that's something wouldn't it be something if you could wake up and your day was cons composed in part of people thanking you for all the good things you've done in the world wouldn't that be good it's not impossible for that to happen so Abram departed yes as the Lord had spoken unto him and lot went with him and Abram was 7 and five years when he departed out of heran that's old now Abraham lives a long time but this is also part of the story so he has a wife who can't have children he has nothing obviously he's been hanging around dad's Shack for a little too long given that he's 75 right it's time it's time to get a fire lit underneath him a bit and so he's not got much going for him but he still decides to to move forward and I've seen this too you know like if you don't have your destiny in Hand by your time you're 30 it's it's rough you start hurting and if you don't have your Destiny at Hand by the time you're 40 then you really start hurting and 40 is a real fork in the road the fork in the road that's always where you meet the Devil by the way and that's because every time you have to make a decision the possibility of evil beckons that's why that is I had a friend I've told you a little about him and he killed himself just after 40 know he had had a book published with a very small press he was quite a good writer but he could could not get himself together and it hit him too hard at 40 and I'm not saying that it's hopeless at 40 I'm not saying that and and I'm not saying that partly because of these verses but also partly because of what I've seen in my clinical practice I've had people come to me who have had very chaotic and ill-spent lives let's say who were in that neighborhood of Age and and it's true for people who are older as well who then decided to make a real effort and to try to make where they were better you know instead of being bitter out where they weren't because that's the bitterness that really does you in it's really not good it's the opposite of gratitude it's it's it's the manifestation of resentment it makes you malevolent it's very very bad to be bitter it's not it's not it's hell to be bitter and if you're 40 and you're not successful then you have to accept your lot and you have to start to improve what's right in front of you and if you do that it doesn't take very long it's quite interesting to watch people things be a lot better in 6 months and they can be way better in 2 years like it's a struggle uphill struggle but it's by no means impossible and and I don't know again what the limit of that is I suppose it depends to degree to some degree on the degree of your commitment but anyway so Abra it's another indication of the the real validity of this story God isn't setting this up to be easy right Abraham's old and and and his and his wife is old too and more than that she's Barren how is he going to be the father of Nations how is he going to be successful ful well the initial departure point is insufficient radically insufficient and and that's very inspiring because it means that you can start from where you are so Abram departed as the Lord had spoken unto him and lot went with him and Abram was 75 years old when he departed out of heran and Abraham took sarai's wife and and lot his brother's son and all their substance that they had gathered and you know he has a relationship with lot right he doesn't have his own son but he his brother died and so he takes his nephew as his son that's grateful you know he could be very angry and and have nothing to do with him because he didn't get his own son but that isn't that isn't what happens is he's offered a substitute let's say and he accepts it and so good for him you know and and that's and that's also something that I've seen that characterizes people who can make the best of a bad lot is they don't get exactly what they want but something comes along that offers possibilities that are sufficient perhaps if exploited properly and they open their heart and welcom them in instead of rejecting them in bitterness and so that's a good thing and that's part of Abraham's character and Abram took sarai's wife and lot his brother's son and all their substance that they had gathered and all the souls that they had gotten in heran and they went forth to go into the land of Canaan into Exile let's say and into the land of Canaan they came and that's another repetition of the transformation story right you have to go to a land where you're not welcome and Abram passed through the land unto the place of sichem Unto the plain of morah and the Canaanite was then in the land and the Lord appeared unto Abram and said unto thy seed I will give you this land and there he build an altar to the Lord who appeared unto him and he removed from then unto a mountain on the east of bethl and pitched his tent having bethl on the west and high on the East and there he built an altar unto the Lord and called upon the name of the Lord now we don't understand these rituals precisely you know I don't know if the people who did this engaged in a meditative ritual was that the idea that you take something of value you do this you you undertake this dramatic transformation a life and death transformation and is that an aid to meditation and what do you do do you sit down and think do you do you pray pray being to ask you know to what do I do next how do I Orient myself in the world it's a useful exercise to do that to I think it's something that people could do every morning I think it's useful to sit down and think okay what's the most important thing I should do today what I have an array of things that call to me to be done some of which I will do with joy and some of which I will bear as responsibilities but I they array themselves in front of me and what what should I attend to First well do you ask or do you decide and it seems to me when I do it because I do it all the time I do it every morning I try to sit down and think okay I've got things that I would like to do and things that call to me out of necessity what do I do first and it's not so much a decision as it is a question and and I don't know what I'm calling on it's I'm calling on my capacity to think I suppose but that's not my capacity exactly I I'm I I can I can commune with whatever provides answers and I can think that that's me thinking but and it isn't that I believe that I can't think I do believe that I can consciously think but that's not the same as calling for inspiration it's not the same process just like a dream is not conscious thinking it's something that happens to you and that kind of inspiration is also something that happens to you because I ask myself well what's the most important thing I could do next and then I have an answer to that but it isn't because I decided exactly I've decided that I'll do it whatever it is and that I want to know what it is those are the decisions but but there's an involuntary aspect to the Sorting that occurs and and that's the psychological equivalent I suppose to this and I guess the sacrifice is when I feel that I will do whatever it is that calls to be done then I don't do the other things that I might want to do and that's a sacrifice it's to me it's the proper sacrifice because my sense is that things don't go properly unless you do what's most important and if I want things to go properly and I do because I've had my taste of things not going properly I want things to go properly and so then it's not so difficult to do what's necessary to to do what makes things go properly under those circumstances and it's hardly see this is partly why the story of Sodom and Gomorrah is embedded in the abrahamic stories I think because that's an apocalyptic story right if things go badly enough the whole city is destroyed and then and the reason it goes badly is because the people in the city do not behave properly and the people in the city might be you and so if you're not behaving properly then you go and so does the city and maybe you don't want maybe you do want that but maybe you don't want that and if you don't want that then maybe and you know that if you don't do things properly then it's you and the city if you actually know that then maybe that terrifies you badly enough so that you're willing to make the sacrifice to do the right things instead of the impulsive things that you might otherwise want to do you know I learned from Victor Frankl and from Carl Jong and from Alexander Sol niton and from many of the people whose works on the Holocaust that I read and on the catastrophes in the Soviet Union and the people who' studied it most deeply always came to the same conclusion the state became corrupted because each individual allowed themselves to be corrupted or perhaps participated joyfully in the process of being corrupted and the consequence of that was the end of the world and so what that means is that if you don't behave properly then you bring about the end of the world and maybe you think well that's only the end of your world fair enough or maybe it's the only the end of your family's world you know which I suppose might give you some pause but there's more to it than that because you're connected to everyone else and what you do that isn't good distributes itself and all the things you don't do that could be good take away from the whole and so if you know that and I do think you know that if you take it seriously because if you look at if you look at the historical events the cataclysmic events of the 20th century seriously I do not think that you can fail to come to that conclusion and Abraham journeyed going on still towards the South that's interesting because to go south means to go downhill to it's not good to go south it's colloquial for going to where you shouldn't go and so this is what happens to Abraham you know he his Ascent is preceded by a descent and that's very common in life I would say and so so the Redemptive element of this narrative is that if the Covenant is constructed properly so it's an arc which is your decision to align yourself with God for all intents and purpos says then even the journey South can be part of a broader Journey upward and there was a famine in the land that's Mother Nature failing to cooperate I mean that's got to be pretty disheartening for Abraham don't you think because he finally gets it together when he's 75 to leave and then you know because God says well it's you know get going and and so the first place he goes everyone's starving to death it's like you know you might think about that as a test of Faith wouldn't you say but he keeps going and then what happens well he has to go to Egypt so great he goes where he's starving where everyone's starving and then to get away from where everyone's starving he goes to a tyranny so the whole beginning of the story is not particularly auspicious and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there for the famine was Grievous in the land it's a repetition of the same idea again there's downhill Voyage out into chaos right it's it's repeated over and over that the beginning of Abraham's journey is basically a sequence of of EX of experiences of Exile chaos tyranny and catastrophe well you should be able to relate to that you know how hard it is to get things together you know you go out to do what you're supposed to do say and there's you're beset by the intransigence of the world and failure well so what are you supposed to do about that well maintain your faith in the good and continue to move forward that's the idea and part of that even if even if you don't buy the metaphor it's like what are you going to do instead that won't make it worse so even if there if it isn't an up that you're pursuing you're at least forestalling the transformation of the chaos into your of your life into sheer hell and that can certainly happen you know you see people who are having a terrible time and then you see people who are having a terrible time who are also in hell and it's a lot better to just have a terrible time than to have a terrible time and be in hell at the same time and it came to pass when he was come to near to enter into Egypt that he said unto Sariah's wife behold now I know that thou art a fair woman to look upon therefore it shall come to pass when the Egyptians shall see thee that they shall say this is his wife and they will kill me but they will save thee alive so look I mean Abraham is Abraham is really having a rough time he's a failure right I mean he's wandering around through the land of starvation now he's going to go be a quasi slave in Egypt he has this incredibly attractive wife and all he can look forward to is the fact that the most successful man in Egypt the Pharaoh will take her from him so he's got the whole embitterment thing pretty much nailed down as far as I can tell and this is when he makes one of his errors let's say and one of the errors that humanizes him say I pray thee that thou art my sister that it may be well for me for thy sake and my soul shall live because of thee and it came to pass that when Abram was come into Egypt the Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair the princes also of pharaoh saw her and commended her before pharaoh and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house and he entreated Abram well for her sake and he had sheep and oxen and he asses and Men servants and Maid servants and she asses and camels so actually things work out pretty well for for Abram despite his deceit right which is quite interesting and I guess it's because if the overarching structure is solid something like that it's something like that then then errors can still be forgiven to speak about it from a metaphorical perspective and the Lord plagued pharaoh and his house with great plagues because of Sarai Abram's wife well it doesn't seem very fair but because the Pharaoh didn't know but but it's not the right way to look at it the right way to look at it see there's a story later in the in the Bible about David and David David could be a pretty bad guy you know so one of the things he does is when he becomes king he he's in his castle and he's looking over the city and he sees a woman nude ba bathing nude sunbathing nude on on a on a a roof out on the city and he's Smitten by her floored by her and he has inquiries made about who she is her name is ba Sheba and and he finds out who her husband is and her husband actually happens to be a general in his army and he arranges for that General to be put at the thick of the battle and killed and then he takes baath Sheba so and and and the Lord is not pleased by that let's put it that way and that's interesting you know it's it's an interesting story because you might say well why can't the king do whatever the hell he wants like seriously he's the king he's not just and he's not like the prime minister or the President right he he's the king and so you might say well why is the king subject to any rules whatsoever what's the rationale for the king being subject to rules well the rational emerges in these stories is there are social strictures that are such that even if the ruler of the land transgresses against them there will be hell to pay and that's continually presented over and over in the biblical stories and it's a natural law sort of idea it's that there are there are intrinsic rules to the game of social human being and if you and maybe intrinsic rules to the to the Natural State of human being you break those rules consciously or uncons iously at your absolute Peril and not only at your peril but at the Peril of the state and it doesn't matter who you are and so I would say this is actually an indication of God being fair rather than being unfair because the rule here is Pharaoh or not you don't get to take someone else's wife and ignorance is no excuse now you might say that's a little bit harsh and perhaps it is a little bit harsh but it's not without Merit the idea is not without Merit and of course Abram is complicit in this despite that he is successful and Pharaoh called Abram and said what is this that thou Hast done unto me why did thou now tell me that she was thy wife why said thou you she is my sister I might have taken her to me to wife now therefore Behold thy wife take her and go thy way and Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him and they sent him away and his wife and all that he had and Abram went up out of Egypt he and his wife and all that he had and lot with him into the South and Abram was very rich in cattle in silver and in gold and that's so it's interesting you know Abraham he he goes to the place of famine and then he goes to the to the place of terity and then he he lies and then he almost loses his wife but because he goes things work out for him and so hoay for that and he went on his JY journees from the south even to bethl unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning between bethl and high unto the place of the altar so he makes another sacrifice which he had made there at the first and there Abram called on the name of the Lord well so he's had an adventure right he's he's he's he's finished his journey and and so there's a culminating point in this narrative and now he doesn't know what to do he's he's left the place he's at he doesn't know what to do so it's time to build an altar and make a sacrifice and figure out and to ask for divine guidance once again to to figure out okay well i' I've done that Been There Done That What's Next and I'm the question is asked seriously and this is something to consider if you want to know what to do ask seriously and say I'm willing to see Abraham sacrifices a life to his vow well so what do you do well you don't sacrifice an animal you don't you don't make a blood sacrifice you do it psychologically you say I'm going to sacrifice my life to this aim that's what you do if you're serious what do I do next well I'm going to sacrifice my life to this aim what is it that I should do that's worth sacrificing my life to that's a serious question well and maybe that's the sort of question that people don't ask because they're afraid of the seriousness of the question and the and the what the magnitude of the potential answer do you really want to know what you should do that would be worth sacrificing your life to well the answer is yes because it's worth it but the answer is also no because like really it's it's your life you know what if you're wrong and you're probably wrong but maybe that doesn't matter maybe it doesn't matter because maybe the rightness is in the process and not in the and not in the decision right because it's not it's the beginning of a sequence of decisions as we've already pointed outto the place of the altar which he had made there at the first and there Abram called on the name of the Lord and lot also and lot also which went with Abraham Abra had flocks and herds and Tents and the land was not able to Bear them that they might dwell together for their substance was great so that they could not dwell together and there was a Strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle the Cowboys and the Herdman of Lot's cattle and the Canaanite and the perizzite dwelt then in the land well and that's interesting too because you know Abram's having a pretty good time of it now right he's out of starvation hey that's good he's out of the Tyranny now he's kind of wealthy and then the story flips on him he's wealthy and now bad thing happens to him right and say he's got all this wealth and so does his nephew and now they can't get along because they have too much stuff so that's quite comical as well I think that's a comic interlude here now they handle it properly and Abram said unto lot let there be no Strife I pray thee between me and thee and between my Herdman and thy Herdman because we're brothers is not the whole land before thee separate thyself I pray thee from me if you'll take the left then I'll take the right or if you depart to the right then I'll go to the left so B basically they sit down and say well you know one of us has got to get out of town and it can be one or the other it doesn't really matter we can flip a coin or but we have to we have to separate and so they they do it amicably and lot lifted up his eyes and looked at all of the plain of Jordan that it was well watered everywhere so that's an intimation of Eden right because you remember Eden means well watered place before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah even as the garden of the Lord like the land of Egypt as thou comest unto zor so interesting you get foreshadowing here again right so lot and Abram are making the decision about where to go and and lot looks out and and sees a a reasonable place but then this warning comes up that there's a there's a city out there there's a place out there where things are not going to go well things are being done badly and things are not going to go well then lot shows him all the plane of Jordan and Lot journeyed East and they separated themselves the one from the other Abram dwelt in the land of Canaan and then lot dwelt in the cities of the plain and pitched his tent towards Sodom but the men of Sodom were Wicked and sinners before the Lord exceedingly now the word sin I've mentioned this to you before I think it's an interesting word it's it's the derivation of an archery term in my understanding of its derivation it it the Greek word was hamartia and hamartia is an archery term which means to to miss the bullsi and you think it's worth thinking about that metaphorically because you got to think about all the ways that you could miss the bullseye right you could close your eyes that's very common you could just not lift up the damn bow and arrow to begin with you could face the wrong way you could be unskilled in your aim but I and I also like the the the archery metaphor because human beings are built on a hunting platform right and we always aim at things we're we're things that we're we're ballistic creatures on a trajectory always and we're always aiming at something we're always aiming at the Mark and which is of course what you do when you hunt right because you have to hit the mark precisely and that's what we're like and so but we're like that psychologically we have to aim at something and then move towards it and and so to sin is to miss the Mark is to is to miss the bullseye to to fail to take aim to aim badly to aim carelessly or to not aim at all and that says well that's that's like a sin of a mission that's to not do and then to be Wicked is to aim at what you know you shouldn't aim at and again I don't I don't think of that as an external morality precisely I think that you can read the entire biblical narrative again from a psychological perspective and say we're not talking about external codes of conduct here although we could we're not the wickedness that's being described is the act of you doing something that you know to be wrong period you know and you may do something you don't know if it's wrong or not that isn't the sort of thing that we're talking about and we're not talking about the things that you do that are right are that other people think are wrong we're not talking about those either we're talking about those things that you consciously do although you know them to be wrong yourself and that's the things that seem to get people into the most trouble in these stories and I I believe that to be the case I think that's very accurate psychologically it's amazing because I see this all the time if you do something wrong and it's because you're ignorant you don't know better it it doesn't go well for you that's the case but if you do something wrong and you know it's wrong the punishment is is manifold and I think the reason for that I think the reason for that is because that makes you can it means you betray your own ideal right if you just don't know well you haven't betrayed your ideal you're just not together maybe you're even willfully blind but if you do something you know to be wrong then you've betrayed your own ideal and that lands you Cain says to God once Cain destroys Abel he says I cannot Bear My Punishment and the Lord said unto to Abram after that lot was separated from lift up now thine eyes look upward and look from the place where thou are northward and Southward and Eastward and Westward for all the land which thou seest to thee I will give it and to thy seed forever and I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth so that if a man can number the dust of the earth then shall all thy seed be numbered arise walk through the land in the length of it and the breadth of it for I will give it unto thee in the C Cathedral at chart I can't say that properly because by French is non-existent so a cathedral is a cross and the transformation takes place at the Crux of the Cross which is exactly right because the the transformation takes place at the point of maximal suffering and the cathedral is designed to indicate that right symbolically now what happens in a religious ceremony is also a journey and it's a journey in some sense to the holy city and then that's also played out in the idea of pilgrimage right because you go to the holy city actually you go to Jerusalem or wherever it is that you think the holy city is you go there and that takes you out of your country and away from your kin and away from your family into the Strange Land and as you make the journey you transform and when you come back you're not the same That's The Hobbit right that's the story of The Hobbit but let's say you can't afford to go on a pilgrimage so you go to the Cathedral at chart and there's a huge maze on the ground and it's the world North West South and East just as God describes here so it's laid out and you enter the maze at one side and in the middle is a stone pattern that looks like a flower and it's it's the place where being Wells forth and it's at the center of the cathedral and what that means is that if you accept your suffering then you move to the place where the spirit of being Wells forth that's what that means and so you enter the the Maze and you walk and it's divided into quadrants and you walk one quadrant completely and then the maze pathway takes you into the next quadrant and you walk that completely and then it takes you to the third one and the fourth one and then when you walk the maze completely everywhere when you've gone everywhere in the world north south east and west where you've when you've traversed the territory completely then you come to the center and then it's yours and that's what this is so I've noticed when I've been renovating houses I like to do that I paid a lot of attention to the psychological process of house renovation because I learned from Yung that Yung said this this is something man he said because he was he was talking about the stages of integration psychological IC integration and he looked beyond P I would say um although P looked very far he said here here's a conjunction you have to get your rationality and your emotion together that's a male female conjunction symbolically speaking male rationality female emotionality you want to bring those together so that they're oriented in the same direction your emotions and your rationality serve the same purpose so then you're unified in Mind and Spirit let's say but that's not good enough once you've got that together then there's a you have a body and then that's a male female conjunction again a Divine conjunction the recreation of Adam before his division into female and male and the Reconstruction of the androgynous Christ that all that all those ideas are linked together so now you have your emotion and your rationality moving in the same direction but you're not acting it out so now you have to unite that abstract part of you with your body and start acting out what you think can feel and that's the next conjunction but it's not the last one the last conjunction is when you realize that there is no distinction between you and your experience they're the same thing and so then when you put together your house you're putting together yourself so I've noticed in when I've lived in places rented or owned didn't matter that if there were part of the place if there was a part of the place that I hadn't attended to whatever that might mean it might meant clean it might have meant fixed but it certainly meant at least thoroughly investigated then that was chaos it was like it was it was like the desert that part that's that's a way of thinking about it it wasn't mine even if I owned it wasn't mine I had to interact with it before it became mine and I had to interact with it and I had to put it in order and then it became mine and then and then to the degree that it became mine and was in order then I was also put in order now you know that because you go into places that make you uncomfortable and maybe it's your own house it's highly probable it's highly probable I you know I walk into well Chinese doctors do this traditional Chinese doctors they go into place people's place and they they diagnose their health conditions on the on the balance of Yin and Yang Chaos and Order they walk into a house this is easy to do you walk into a house there's too much chaos hey you can detect that in no time flat everything is out of order and chaotic you don't even want to be there you certainly don't want to open the refrigerator that's for sure and there are things that should have been done years ago everywhere and every one of those things is a fight that hasn't happened and something that's been avoided and you can't even walk in there and maintain your health as soon as you walk in there you're sicker than you were when you were outside and that's one sort of place and then another sort of place is you go in you look at the living room and the person has vacuumed the living room rug and the lines that were vacuumed are parallel to one another and the and the furniture is covered with plastic and you get a glass of water and then just as you're going to set it down on the coffee table the person rushes over and puts a coaster underneath it and everything in that house says to you that it would be a lot more perfect in that house if you were either not there or dead and that's the and that's the message that the whole house is blasting at you and if you happen to live there then you're going to be sick and what you're going to be sick from is too much order and in the other house you're going to be sick from too much chaos and so when you interact with a house the unexplored parts are the chaos that have the parts that you have not yet contended with are the chaos that is not yet been transformed by your embodied logos action into habitable territory and it does not belong to you arise walk through the land in the length of it and the breadth of it for I will give it unto thee then Abram removed his tent and came dwelt in the plain of mamra which is in heon and built there an altar unto the Lord and it came to pass in the days of amrel king of shanar arok king of alisar chalomar there's a lot of Kings we won't talk about them these made war with barah king of Sodom and with Bersa king of Gomorrah shab king of adma and the king of Bella which is zor and these were joined together in the veil of sidom which is the salt sea now this is actually very much relevant hey because you see the veil of sedom which is the salt sea is the farthest South you can go if South is down because it's the Dead Sea and the Dead Sea is the lowest place that there is so what's happened is that there's chaos in the lowest place that there is that's what this story says and what happens to lot is he gets Tangled Up in the chaos of the lowest place that there is and in the 14th year came chador Lor and the kings that were with him and smote the Reames and astroth kame and the zims in ham and the emmans in Shava K katham and the horites in their Mount sire unto elperin which is by the Wilderness and they returned and came to en mishpat which is cadesh and smote all the country the amalekites amalekites and the amorites that dwelt in he hes haaz zontar there we go perhaps and there went out the king of Sodom and the king of Gomorrah and the king of adma and the king of zbam and the king of Bella the same is zor and they joined battle with them in the veil of sidm so this is absolute chaos and Mayhem in the lowest place it's hell essentially with chedore the king of alam and with tidal king of Nations and amrel king of shanar and arot king of elazar Four Kings with five and the veil of sidm was full of slim pits low and hell likee with war isn't enough they had to throw the Slime pits in there apparently around the Dead Sea there are pits of bite bit bitumen like the like the tar pits in near La and so this seems to actually be historically accurate and the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled and fell there and they that remained fled to the mountain and they took their goods and they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah and all their victuals and went their way and they took lot Abram's brother's son who dwelt in Sodom and his goods and departed so Abram has a family member who falls into the lowest place and there came one that had escaped and told Abram the Hebrew for he dwelt in the plain of mam the Amorite brother of ishol and brother of Anor and these were Confederate with Abram and when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive he armed his trained servants born in his own house 318 and pursued them unto Dan well so now we also know that Abraham is a pretty brave guy right he gets word that this horrible War has broken out in the worst of all possible places and that his nephew is involved and the first thing he does is you know Mount up his posy and get the hell in there and rescue his nephew so Abraham's no whatever goodness is from the Old Testament perspective it isn't harmlessness right it isn't emasculation and castration it's not that it's not weakness it's not the inability to fight none of that is associated with virtue it's the sort of strength that enables someone to mount and armed team of 300 people when he finds out that his nephew is being kidnapped in a terrible war and to get the hell out there and take him back and so that's a that's a that's a that's a call to to it's a call to power that not not a kind of peaceful meekness that's funny too because you know there's a line in the New Testament the meek shall inherit the earth I got to look at my phone for a sec here because I don't know what time it is there's a line in the New Testament that says and send The Sermon on the Mount says the meek shall inherit the earth and that I that line always bothered me I thought no way that's not that that's not right Meek can't be the right word so when I was doing the story of Noah and talking about The Sermon on the Mount I spent a bunch of time looking at commentaries on that line looking at the roots the you know the Greek roots and the Hebrew roots and trying to figure out what that meant and It Meek does not mean Meek that's wrong here's what it means those who have weapons and know how to use them but still keep them sheathed will inherit the earth Jesus that's a lot different man it's a lot better right because the way it's normally it's normally interpreted is if you're so weak that you're harmless then things will go well for you it's like no that's not right that's that's not that can't be right it doesn't fit with the narrative it certainly doesn't fit with this narrative and he divided himself against them he and his servants by night and smot them and pursued them onto hobah which is on the left side of Damascus and he brought back all the goods and his brother lot and and his goods and the women also and the people good work Abraham and the kings of Sodom went out to meet him after his return at the slaughter of chalomar and of the kings that there were there with him at the valley of Shiva which is the King's Dale and melch as a king of Salem brought forth Bread and Wine and he was the priest of the most high God and he blessed him and said Blessed Be Abram of the most high god possessor of Heaven and Earth and blessed be the most high God which has delivered thine enemies into thine hand and gave him TI of all and the king of Sodom said to Abraham give me the persons and take thy Goods to thyself this that that were the goods that Abram that Abram rescued right of the of the Kings and Abram said to the king of Sodom I have lift up mine hand unto the Lord what is that mean it means I've made a vow that's what it means that that's what that phrase means I've made a vow to God the possessor of Heaven and Earth that I will not take anything from a thread even to a shoelace I won't take anything that's yours lest you should say I've made Abram Rich I'll take only that which my young men have eaten and the portion of men that went with me and Anor eshkol and mam let them take their portion and so Abraham decides here he's he's made this immense sacrifice and done this incredibly Brave act and rescued his nephew and rescued the king's goods and and they offer him a reward and he says I'm not going to take the reward and the reason for that is that he doesn't want to contaminate the the the ethical purity of his actions he doesn't want to be paid he doesn't want it he doesn't want to benefit from doing he doesn't want to what is it exactly he doesn't want to benefit inappropriately from doing the right thing it's something like that and so it's another Testament to his character and a very complex Testament right because he's not a s he's not a good man in any simple sense I mean look what's just happened he's he's mounted an armed he's mounted an armed uh he's he's LED an army into battle and and part and and participated in a Slaughter he refuses to benefit from it except to get back what was his that's it he refuses to benefit from it except to get back what was rightfully his and in that way he maintains his Covenant with God even to a Sho latch at I anything though never so small or me lest thou should claim a share with God in the honor Duty him this is from Matthew P who is an English non-conformist Theologian commenting on that line even to a Sho latchet I.E anything though never so mean or small lest thou should claim a share with God in the honor due to him to whose blessing alone I do and I will owe my riches or lest thou should say Abram is enriched with my spoils and however he pretended kindness and charity yet indeed it was his covetousness that put him upon this work after these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision saying saying fear not Abram I'm thy shield and thy exceedingly and thy exceeding great reward the vision issue [Music] again while we went through that last week fear not Abram I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward and Abram said Lord God what can you give me seeing as I'm childless childless and that's the only thing that matters to Abram at this point and the steward of my house is this elier of d damasc us no kin and Abraham said Abram said behold to me thou Hast given no seed and lo one born in my house is mine he and behold the word of the Lord came unto him saying this shall not be thine Heir but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowel should be nine hair so he gets promised The Impossible once again and he brought him forth abroad and said now look towards the heaven and tell the Stars if thou be able to number them and he said unto him so shall thy seed be and he believed in the Lord and counted to him for righteousness you see and this this this is the Covenant idea this belief because here's the belief it's the willingness to act as if the world is constructed so that if you do the right thing the best possible outcome will occur it's a decision that's the C Covenant right it's a decision about how to live in the world because the evidence can't be there before you make the decision right and so you might hedge your bests you know when when Christ comes back in the Book of Revelation to judge people because he comes back as a judge and virtually everyone gets cast out with the chaff and not saved with the wheat and he he says something very interesting he appears in the vision with a sword coming out of his mouth it's a horrifying vision and he divides the the he divides Humanity into the Damned and the saved or the dam yes the Damned and the saved he says something very interesting he says to those who were neither hot nor cold I will spew you out of my mouth and and it's it's a it's a it's a disgust metaphor right and what it says is that the worst punishment isn't waiting for those who committed to something and did wrong the worst punishment is reserved for those who committed to nothing and stayed on the fence and that's really something too that's really something to think about and it's also something I believe to be true because I see that stasis is utterly destructive because there's no progress all there is is movement backwards there's aging and suffering and no progress and so to not commit to anything is the worst of all transgressions to commit means to put your body and soul into something to offer your life as a sacrifice means that you're willing to make a bargain with fate and the bargain is I'm going to act as if if I give it my all then the best possible thing will happen because of that and to to not see the analogy between that and the the AC of faith in God is to misunderstand the story completely and it has to be an Act of Faith because how are you going to know you can look at other people but isn't going to do it it's at kirkgard was very clear about this sort of thing there's certain sorts of truths that you can only learn for yourself through experience and that's of course why Abram also has to go out alone right he has to leave his K it's it's an individual it's the individuation process like dying it's something that you do alone there's no way you can tell what is within your grasp let's say unless you make the ultimate sacrifice and there's no way of finding out without actually making it and so that's the sacrificial act right that's that's reemphasized in the act of Abram being called upon to sacrifice Isaac you think about that is Abram he's been doing he's been like breaking himself into pieces trying to progress forward through starvation and tyranny and War and deceit and the potential loss of his wife and childlessness and like everything that can really befall you in some sense and finally God grants him Isaac when he's old it's impossible he gets Isaac his son and then what does God do next is say well you know that son that you've been waiting for so for so long it's like I'd like to see just exactly what you're made of so I think you should offer him up as a sacrifice and I mean it's a very barbaric story in a sense and maybe in more than just a sense but Abraham does maintain his Covenant he's willing to make the sacrifice he's willing to make this is the thing he's willing to make whatever sacrifice is necessary to keep his Covenant with God intact and that that's that and that's the decision well maybe it's no surprise that people don't do that and he believed in the Lord and he counted it to him for righteousness and he said unto him I am the Lord that brought thee out of er of the cheles to give this land to you to inherit it and he said Lord God whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it and he said to him this is a sacrificial story again take an E A heer of three years and a boat of three years and a ram of three years and a turtle dove and a young pigeon it's fairly specific actually and he took all these and divided them and laid each piece one against another but the birds divided he not now there's a reason for that and I don't know the reason for it and when the fowls came down upon the carcasses Abram drove them away and when the sun was going down a deep sleep fell upon Abram and low a horror of great Darkness fell upon him that didn't mean he was afraid of the dark which is what I thought it meant when I first read it it isn't what it means it means that he fell into a trance or something like that and then he was enveloped by absolute horror so that's how this Story begins and here's the commentary from Joseph Benson who was an English Methodist Minister who lived in 1749 was born in 1749 and when the sun was going down about the time of the E evening oblation the washing for he Abode by them praying and waiting till toward evening a deep sleep fell upon Abram well this was not a common sleep through weariness or carelessness I don't know what a Sloop is That's supposed to be sleep not a common sleep through weariness or car carelessness but a Divine ecstasy that being wholly taken off from things sensible he might be wholly taken up with the contemplation of things spiritual well it really makes you wonder what Abraham was up to in his campsite so he was participating in something that enabled this experience and lo a or a horror of great Darkness fell upon him this was designed to strike awe upon the spirit of Abram and to possess him with a holy reverence holy fear prepares the soul for Holy Joy God humbles first and then lifts up Echoes of psychedelic experience and he said unto Abram know of assurity that thy seed shall be a stranger in a land that is not theirs and Shall Serve them and they shall afflict them 400 years and also that Nation whom they Shall Serve I will judge and afterward shall they come out with great substance and thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace Thou shalt be buried in a good old age but in the fourth generation they shall come hither again for the iniquity of the amorites is not yet full commentaries of Joseph Benson once again they shall come hither again hither to the land of Canaan wherein thou not now art the reason why they must not have the land of promise in possession until the fourth generation is because the iniquity of the amorites was not yet full the righteous God has Des determined that the amorites shall not be cut off till they arrived at such a pitch of w wickedness and therefore till it come to that the seed of Abram must be kept out of possession so the interpretation of the story essentially is that Abraham's descendants will end up enslaved in Egypt for a long a lengthy period of time and eventually come back to the land of Canaan and it's interesting too because this is part of Abram's bargain with God and in this divine ision I mean he's been promised everything but it's a pretty tough bargain because you know when when when God is pushed or reveals himself let's say he says look you're going to get your damn descendants you know but it's not going to be uh it's it's it's going to be a tough Journey they're going to be SL enslaved for a very long time and eventually come back and you won't see it you'll be dead long before then and so it's a realistic promise in a sense and you might say well Abram is so D desperate to to keep the faith that he's willing to read good into what isn't good but I think I I think I don't think that's the right way to look at it I think the right way to look at it is that the people who wrote these stories were very realistic and they knew that even if things turned out well for you I mean it was still going to be real you know it wasn't going to be some fantasy it's like let's say you have a family that flourishes is people are still going to die they're still going to get sick they're they're still going to have they're still going to be alive you know with all of its suffering but it'll be the but it'll be a life that's rich enough and complete enough so that it'll justify its its nature essentially and so and it came to pass that when the sun went down and it was dark Behold a smoking furnace and a burning lamp that passed between the pieces Albert barns American Theologian commented on this the oven of smoke and lamp of flame symbolize the smoke of Destruction and the light of Salvation they're passing passing through the pieces of the sacrificial victims and probably consuming them as an accepted sacri rifice are the ratification of the Covenant on the part of God as the dividing and presenting of them were on the part of Abram in the same day the Lord made a covenant with Abram saying unto thy seed I have given this land from the river of Egypt unto the Great River the river Euphrates the kenites and the kenites and the cadit ETC now Sarai Abram's wife bear him no children and she had a handmade wait a second I think we'll stop there I'm tiring out and it's just and it's 929 so that's a very good place to stop so [Applause] yes so so I should I should close properly and just sum up so what happens here is that that Abram enters into a covenant with God to act in the world and the action is an adventure story essentially and the adventures repeat and they're and they're punctuated by success and S and sacrifice and Rec contemplation right and so it's this it's this journey it's the it's the hero's journey uphill I'm here there's a crisis I Collapse I reconstruct myself to a higher place and life is like that continually and that's the story of Abraham and that's all contained though it's all contained and this is the thing that's so cool because that is what your life is going to be like whether you plan out your life or not it's going to be punctuated like that maybe it won't go up maybe it'll go down the question is what sort of container do you need to be in in order to tolerate the movement up and down and that's what the story of Abraham provides it provides a it provides a description of the Covenant that's like the ark the Covenant and the Ark are the same thing right except the Covenant is the psychological equivalent of the Ark and the Covenant is have faith in the structure of existence and go forth forth that's the Covenant and the and the story is that's the best possible solution that you have at hand all right so I'm going to make a request with regards to the questions which may mean you have to reorient yourself in the line I would like the first two questions on each side if possible to relate specifically to tonight's lecture and then I can and then I can uh address more General issues if that's if that's okay so and I again I would like you to carefully speak into the mic so that the people who are watching can hear can you hear me yeah I can uh the story about Abraham uh saying his wife was his sister you referred to that as him making a mistake I'm not quite sure I understand how you're reading that as a mistake seeing as it was very deliberate decision and it had a pretty good outcome for him and he does the same thing a few chapters later yes this is true you see I don't I don't I don't feel that I've cracked that part of that story properly now the reason I said it was a mistake is because it's clearly an act of Deceit and it and it and it does put the Pharaoh in a very awkward position not to mention s Sarai by the way or S how do you say that I don't know how to say that Sarai Sarai it's SAR to begin with yes is that right Sarai yes okay and then it's Sarah and that so Abram means High King something like that and Abraham means father of the people and Sarai means princess and Sarah means mother of the people it's some I I have it exactly right I'll tell you next week but that's part of the name transformation the the it it seems to me that at least in part it's an indication of Abra Abraham's willingness to use a suboptimal solution when driven to it by necessity I don't think it's a heroic act to pretend that your wife is your sister now you know and and and maybe you might say well under the circumstances there was nothing else he could have done but it does seem I can't see how you can interpret it other than as a departure from the truth but I know that that's not all there is to it and it does seem to work out well for him and my interpretation is that well if you're oriented properly in the world the grace of God allows you a few necessary mistakes something like that do do you have an alternative idea I just don't think I would refer to it as a mistake well why not what what is it about that that that is it because it's Abraham and and it isn't reasonable to attribute mistakes to him or what is it it's cuz at least I think it says in the text that he's looking to get out of a bad situation and he does whatever is the best thing that it's available to him and not to mention as I said he does the same trick a few chapters later yeah well maybe maybe it is the case that you know it's like a white lie issue you know you say well is a white lie acceptable I would say well the best that you can come up with is acceptable that that doesn't mean it's it's optimal though right like I I I I'll give you a a foolish example because it's the best that I could do at the moment but you know if you if you have a loved one who says does this dress make me look fat the answer to that question is I don't answer questions like that that's the answer right because the other answer is the white lie I mean at least in this context and that means that on the one hand you're maintaining the the the positive contract between you and the person who's asking the question but then you're still sacrificing the truth within that so you're you're you're maintaining your relationship with the higher ordered truth but sacrificing a lower order truth and and that would be better than the reverse but it's not as good as not sacrificing the truth at all and I would say that if you're maybe fortunate because sometimes it's a matter because you can be in a situation where all your choices are bad I've seen people in situations like that I've probably been in situations like that and maybe that is what's happening in that story is every choice Abraham is in front of him is bad but I can't help but think that it's more than that it means that if you're doing the best you can and it's not perfect it can still be good enough that's how it looks to me thank you hello Dr Peterson uh you mentioned earlier that there's been a pervasive problem of nihilism and moral relativism uh and that that can kind of be cured with a less naive optimism that's grounded in fact and what can actually be done to improve improv situations is there a way to communicate that message to a younger audience say teenagers in a high school environment which is nowadays a hot bed for this kind of nihilistic morally relativist thinking great I'm glad you asked that so I'm going to tell you I was thinking about saying this at the beginning but I decided not to but now I get to say it because I got this question so that's so cool um I I have plans and so plan number number one I have worked with some people to design a website that will enable High University students to enter their course descriptions their professor's name the subdiscipline and the university and an artificial intelligence agent will tell them if the course is postmodern Neo Marxist indoctrination not not only and I have made tentative Arrangements with someone to finance a advertising campaign for that site and so the goal is well to inform the consumer do you want to be educated or do you want to be indoctrinated and happily you'll be able to use the site equally for both purposes right because if you want to if you want to take the the the courses that I would regard as indoctrination then this will give you a way of ensuring that nothing that you get exposed to won't be of that sort so and then I'm going to make a video to introduce that to University students and their parents and I'm going to outline what I think the universities are doing wrong there's about 20 things they're doing wrong and and they're seriously wrong things and I'm going to start by describing the utility of a university education a Humanities education because hum's education makes you into the kind of autonomous individual that can go away from that can be independent and can communicate and think and that has immense economic value right not not just spiritual value and cultural value but economic value and so there's I don't want to tell people not to go to university I want to tell them to go to university and grow the hell up and and learn to communicate and think and I want them to avoid the people who will take the spirit away from them and so that's what that website is going to do I hope and the goal is to drop the enrollment in the indoctrination courses across the English-speaking World by 75% within 5 years that's the goal so and then you asked that you asked more specifically about high school students well we have this future authoring program that has been used for University students and it produces about a 30% Improvement in retention and we've tested several thousand University students anyone can use it by the way it's not for University students but it was easy for us to test its beneficial impact even if people only spend under 90 minutes on it it's still has approximately that effect especially on young men especially if they're ethnic minorities especially if they're not oriented towards a career and didn't do very well in school and so that's really cool because it's really hard to design a psychological intervention that helps the people who are doing the worst most psychological interventions so imagine there are people who are doing not so well and people who are doing well and you produce a psychological intervention what usually happens is the people who are doing well benefit even more right but this seems to work for the disenfranchised so we're thrilled about that really and so we've produced a ver version for high school students yes and so but we don't have them look three to five years out into the future because they can't and they don't know enough you know it's hard for f full fully mature adults to look that far into into the future high school kids can probably manage 3 to six months and so we're going to have them concentrate on character development and and what they want for their from their friendships and how they would like to orient themselves in school and to start thinking about the sorts of person that they would like to be and that never happens in schools weirdly enough there's a guy named John Gat who won the teacher of the year award in New York City and then in New York state and then stopped being a teacher by the way um he wrote a series of books about the education system that explain why students in pre-university education aren't taught to be autonomous individuals it's very interesting what he's discovered historically but anyways we're going to Market that probably to parents and to University students themselves rather than to the schools because our experience has been that producing this sort of material directly for individuals works much better it's much more efficient and so then students will be able to or or their parents will be able to purchase the program and the students will be able to use it to design their own personality in a manner that would make them thrilled to be alive let's say that would be the goal right that would be amazing see [Applause] yes I question I'm I'm going to get you to turn it to put it down a little more even excellent perfect yes yesl yeah and I I think um especially the literature and developmental psychology I think Bears this out but um I think a huge part of learning is interaction and discourse and that seems very difficult in an online setting um even if it's through text I don't I don't quite see it as the same thing and additionally I think there's a huge motivational Factor that's uh difficult to um it's difficult to keep motivated when you're isolated and nobody else around you is pursuing the same goal so um how would you address those you're absolutely right on both counts um I would say that the idea of an online Humanities University is grandiose and it may not be possible and the reason for that is that and as you're alluding to we actually don't understand what the university is we think it's lectures and exams but it's probably not it's certainly being together with people of your own age as you start your life it's moving away from your household it's establishing yourself as a credible intellect right it's it's picking a new group of peers it's all of those things and it isn't n clear how that can be replicated online now the people that I'm talking to are sophisticated enough to understand Marshall mclin's dicum that the medium is the message and so I think it would be a mistake to attempt to duplicate the University online because you can't but so what we're concentrating on right now is not so much content but infrastructure the question is we want to set up an educ an a system of education online that will be autonomously self governing and self-improving and the content in some sense we're not so much interested in the content as we are interested in the process by which people who generate good content might be optimally rewarded and that's what we want to get right and that's probably a discussion that'll take a a year or two years to to flesh out we we started to conceptualize what the system might look like but but to your point it isn't we're not taking lectures and putting them online although obviously that's what I'm doing that that that isn't going to make an online Humanities University and we know that I think everything you said is exact is is very accurate and also indicative of the high probability that something like this would fail so but you know we're we're we're going to try to be aware of the pitfalls we're also going to I read this great book I would recommend this book it's it's a very funny book by a guy named John Gaul it's called systemantics and it's a cult class classic systematics and it's about how systems really work and how they fail and it's a work of ironic comedy but it's quite brilliant and one of the things one line he it's it's made of a bunch of axioms and here's one Axiom I just love this is the system does not do what its name says it does and so what I worked in Alberta Social Services when I was a kid about 18 or so and I worked as a consultant and I I one of the and and I I got involved in projects that were above my pay grade I would say and I learned a lot about how how large bureaucracies functioned and I was asked at one point to update a report that had been made the year before about what percentage of the spending of the social services department actually went to the recipients of welfare and and social Aid in general and the answer was the system did not know and could not find out and they had hired a very expensive consulting firm to answer that question the year before and I was asked update it which was quite odd to begin with but then I did I went and looked at the Consulting report and I went into the data and what I found was that none of it was real but even more importantly there was no way of knowing whether it was true or false because the system had never been set up to calculate what percentage of its total spending actually went to the recipients of social Aid it just blew me away and then I thought and I was reading this book at the same time and I thought oh the purpose of the social services department is to employ people in the social services department and I mean I wasn't being cynical about that it's like charity most Charities you know it's like 90% overhead so what does the charity do it runs itself now you don't want to be cynical about that because big businesses are the same and most like even if they're running at a profit the profit is like 5% so the business spends 95% of its time maintaining itself you know and it makes a bit of product and it makes a bit of profit but most of what it does is maintain itself so anyways one of the axim in that book that was one of them is the system does not do what it says it does so that's because then you can face the system with a clear head and say okay well this thing isn't doing what it says it's doing but it's probably doing something and the thing it's doing might be useful but we should figure out what that thing is so that's been really useful to me as a guide to thinking the other thing he said was if you want to build a big system that works start with by building a small system that works and scale it and we've done that for example with the self-authoring programs has built small scale systems that are very robust with the hope that they'll scale and that's the same we'll do the same thing here is start with a small amount of content see if we can reward see what I would like to have happen is you know there's a lot of people out there who are pretty intensely educated and some of them are really creative and so imagine that there's a timeline imagine you could we do a Humanities issue imagine there's a timeline say of a thousand years that's scalable then imagine that that there would be lectures associated with the timeline at different levels of resolution so we might call for a lecture on uh this the third Century a ad what happened in the 3D Century ad you've got half an hour to explain it you can explain it any way you want you can use animation you can use lecture you can use text you can make a movie we don't care what you have to do is that's the topic that's the time span that's the amount of time and then you can post it and so we could generate content that way and let people experiment and then we can have people review the content as part of their education generate questions about the content as part of their assignments rate the questions as part of their assignments and rate the content and then if we charge people imagine you had to pay $50 a month to enroll something like that maybe we would allow you when you first enroll maybe you get to use $5 of it as disposable income you can reward that to any Creator you want but as you progress through the courses your right to determine where your money goes would increase as you became more and more educated hopefully that way we would get some quality control built into it so those are some of the ideas that we're that we're starting to play around with so the only one I'm consider about is the motivation what's that the motivation issue for individuals um well that I'm not going to go into that because it would take too long but but rest assured that we are thinking about that very hard as well we're going to build competition into it we're going to build cooperation into it we hope to build peer inter relationships into it I think all that's possible but but complex right because it's we don't know how to build an online education system really and but it would be fun to experiment and see if we can figure out how to do it so thank you thank you hi uh so I I couldn't really um zero in on any particular question so it's more of a family questions that I have about the nature and cultivation of conscience which was in a sense what the story uh exemplified about Abraham why why do you say that why do you think that the story exemplified the development of cons of conscience spe specifically well uh going back to the zigzag yeah right and the star how you have to keep okay so that's what you were referring to orienting yourself completely autonomously on your own terms right yeah uh to uh okay so you you hit on something great there I think you know and this is something weirdly enough that I learned most particularly from the Pinocchio movie which I spent a lot of time studying is because in in the Pinocchio movie Jiminy Cricut is an avatar of Christ essentially but it's very strange because he's a bug that's the first thing that's kind of weird and because Jiminy cricet is Southern us slang for Jesus Christ among other things but and and these things get aggregated in in in great Mythic dramas like that and that's a great Mythic drama but you know one of the things that really makes Jiminy cricet different from Christ apart from the fact that Christ wasn't a cricket is that the cricket learns as he progresses right even though he's the conscience and so you'd think that he would be the infallible guide that isn't how the movie makers set it up and that's so cool is that he's just as muddle-headed as Pinocchio at the beginning and he's a bit arrogant and puffed up too and so took me a long time to think that through and then I realized that well you you have the voice of you have the voice of culture in you you have the voice of culture within you but it's old and dead and out of date and it's not fully articulated and updated and then what happens is that if you enter into a dialogue with it and you Hammer yourself against the world then you get hammered into shape and so does your conscience and so you both become elevated and so well so anyways I think that's that's ridiculously cool because means that your conscience you don't have an infallible guide but you have something within you that you could build into an infallible guide if you cooperated with it and and fed it so well so I I think that's very interesting so that being said uh yeah the picture that I have in my mind of um uh the cultivation of virtue in general it's kind of like taking a a block of wood and trying to carve out a sphere out of it it'll never be perfectly round but the more you carve right the rounder and rounder right that's successive appro o imation yeah well one of it's It's also like U what do you call that compound interest this is one of the things that's also and I think this puts you on the to Those whom more shall be given part of the curve it's like you know you don't have to improve yourself very much each week to really improve yourself on ridiculous amount in a year you know so you could make you could you could you could vow to make your day one 100th of a per better than the day before and that would do the trick if you were if you were constant about that that would do the trick so that that's this success of approximation is you you don't want to underestimate the utility of incremental progress man it's really it's deadly powerful so so so let's say you get to the um you know the higher ends of the curve right you're like a pretty virtuous person um let's say you even become a sage or something of the sort and I mean when should you doubt your conscience like what are things that we should watch out for even when we that's great well that's yep okay um Ju Just to get it out of the way right yeah um I don't know how much this relates well it does relate but Psychopaths for example the entire idea that they lack a conscience and that's why right that's what psychopathy is um whether or not you agree with that def definition right but there's an issue of conscience again at play with psychopathy um how can we the first question uh doubt ourselves in a way that's warranted right regardless of how virtuous we've become yes and can you treat a psychopath could they cultivate a conscience okay so let we'll start with the first one part of the reason that that I believe that freedom of speech is the canonical right let's and obligation right more importantly even obligation is that that's how you figure out if you're wrong you know because so I sit home and I think and I think and I think let's say but I'm like who am I to think there's so many things I don't know that it's it's just there's the what I know compared to what I don't know is so minuscule that it's a Preposterous act just to say something okay so so no matter how much I sit at home and think I'm not going to fix that I'm going to be full and then I have biases but my temperament and I have biases because of my malevolence and I have biases because of my my gender my sex let's say since we're not so fond of that word um so IFA no matter how much I sit home and think I'm still going to be wrong and malevolent so then what I have to do is I have to talk to some other people and I have to say this is what I think and it's going to be ugly you know because what the hell do I know but then if I listen people will tell me why I'm wrong and lots of people have been telling me why I'm wrong like a lot and it's hard you know it's hard but it's but I've learned something from it like I I had this Revelation let's say about being yelled at by your father now I know that you can be yelled at too much by your father but it's like you're wrong man and so someone's yelling at you and maybe they're only 10% right but if you shut the hell up and listen then you can figure out where you're wrong and then maybe you can be thankful for that and then maybe if you shut up and listened your father would quit yelling at you you know because he's wrong too what the hell does he know he knows how to yell at you and tell you how you're wrong and he's throwing things out you at you that are probably not true but some of it's true and you know if someone can tell you why you're wrong they've given you a great gift because then you don't have to be wrong anymore and you might think well who cares if you're wrong but you know there's a line in the New Testament too is if the blind lead the blind won't they fall in won't they fall into a ditch the answer to that question by the way is yes they will and so the reason that you want to think is because thinking is how you like when you think you create a a fictional world that's that's an analog of the world and then you make an avatar of yourself to act in that world and then if the Avatar dies you don't act out those actions right well so if you think properly then you don't have to suffer and die and so if you can say what you think and people can tell you why you're wrong and you know to say what you think under extreme circumstances means that you're going to say things that no one wants to hear because those are the things you don't know about those are the things that are conflictual and difficult those are going to be hard conversations man and you're going to be wrong about them a lot if you don't get to stumble forward with your stupidity then you can't be corrected and so so there's no distinction between free speech and thinking and there's no distinction between thinking and thriving and so those who want to inhibit Free Speech do not wish for people to thrive and I believe that so thinking does not happen in inside your head that's only the beginnings of thinking and it's this that we're doing here that's thinking you know so we have to protect that Psychopaths I don't I say this I hope non- naively also having dealt with psychopaths in my clinical practice and I would say now and then in my life I don't believe in Psychopaths I don't believe that we know enough to say there are people born without conscience um I don't think the psychometric measurement of psychopathy is everything that it should be I've been trying to model it B in the big five domain I think now it's complicated because so I would say a psychopath a classic psychopath is likely extroverted especially assertive disagreeable and unconscientious and maybe extremely low in neuroticism so you can't frighten them but so that's a rare combination because it's extreme many traits right but that I don't believe that that means that someone with that personality configuration is doomed from birth to a pathological existence because there's things about psychopathy that that the that the classifiers those who claim like clly that the psychopath is born in some sense can't explain it's like well what about the cruelty there seems to be a motive there you know they're passionless and they lack no they lack emotion well why are they cruel then for entertainment well but then you have to explain the entertainment motivation like there's a failure in some sense with the classic psychopathy theorist to come to grips with the problem of malevolence it's skirted over and you can't do that if you're talking about psychopathy it's like malevolence is the bloody issue here and so the other issue with the psychopath is that he's irredeemable right that's the idea I don't think we know enough to make such claims now and that doesn't I know the psychopathy literature quite well and I have great respect for the primary researchers in the field I want to make that perfectly clear but we're talking at a different we're talking we're approaching the problem from a different level of analysis here something like a spiritual level of analysis and I don't think that there's an easy easy translation from the descriptive psychometric psychiatric approach to the spiritual level they don't match and I'm more likely to say let's not assume the soul is doomed from birth right and I'm I'm loathed to think that there are people born irredeemable although I do think there are irredeemable people you know the the death penalty issue is interesting in that regard you know because I've read a lot about really terrible people and I've also read a lot about what really terrible people said about themselves and many of them wished for the death penalty and so it's absolutely clear that there are things that you can do that deserve the death penalty but that doesn't mean that the state should have the right to impose it that's a different question so yeah in the previous lecture you mentioned the 2008 economic crisis and one of the very interesting themes that's emerged at many levels be it universities or economic policies this perceived culture War specifically the the idea of Marx versus Mill and you've criticized postmodern and Neo Marxist thought very frequently one interesting critic of uh the policies of the EU specifically EC ECB and IMF during the Greek debt crisis was Janis vakas the former Greek Finance Minister and his criticism of Mill was the was Mill's alleged contempt for the population and vaca's comments on the type of capitalism that results in too big to fail he describes himself as an erratic Marxist to me personally he's an example of someone whose position on the philosophical moing of policy is interesting to compare and contrast with yours he's certainly not your typical Marxist or postmodernist even though I'm not really sure what that means but if you look at his work during the Greek debt crisis and his current work with dm25 he seems to be well reasoned well positioned and and and articulate now I wanted to know if you had an opinion on that type of criticism of Mill or his taking of a position as an erratic Marxist okay I would say I would say no to the specifics of of the question I don't think that I have the detailed expertise in order to answer the question at the level of analysis that you where you formulated it but I I have something to say that's more General about the set of phenomena that you described there's no doubt that distribution is a major problem that capitalism contends with imperfectly at best and the distribution problem is the predo distribution problem right and and something that Marx commented on which mostly in the monetary sphere is that money tends to accumulate in the hands of very few people it's like there's no doubt about that now as we've discussed before the people in whom hands the money accumulates do turn over more than people say think especially in in in countries that are functioning reasonably well and it's really important that that happens yes yes yes but that doesn't that doesn't solve the problem of the fact that produced Goods gravitate towards an extreme minority now they're also produced Often by extreme minority which is also a problem um I would say then that the idea that capitalism is more prone to that distribution problem than any other system I don't believe that to have been demonstrated at all and I think that capitalism is actually pretty good at self-destruction except when that's interfered with and I think that's particularly the case in the United States where generally the policy has been if you're an idol with feet of clay no matter how big you are you get to fail now that's been compromised severely in the last 20 years and we're probably going to pay for that I think they really paid for that in Japan right where there was every attempt to prop out the the gods that should have died so so fair enough for the critique of capitalism that's not the issue the issue is do you have a better idea and if the idea is well we could kind of do what Mark suggested then you don't get to have that position and claim what should I say I haven't seen any evidence that systems predicated on that set of axioms have done anything but more harm than good thank you yeah and when will you be announcing the monthly extension to this lecture series as soon as I find out whether or not I can rent this theater in the fall yeah thank you we'll see you next week [Applause]"

And it's a really important line and I thought I would reemphasize it. Because the Bible is a book that's been written forward and backwards in time, in some sense, like most books. Because if you write a book, of course, when you get to the end, if you're the writer, you can adjust the beginning and so on. So it has this odd appearence of linearity but it really isn't linear. It's like you're God, in some sense, standing outside of time, that's your book, and you can play with time anywhere along it. And the people who put the books together took full advantage of that, and that makes the story..."

Or at least that's one way of looking at it.

And then, from the neurobiological perspective, or from the scientific perspective, counsciousness is not something we understand, I don't think we understand it at all.

That's always what we're grappling with and somehow we use our consciousness to give that form, and this is how people act.

And you see, what happens in the story of Adam and Eve as well is that when people become self-conscious— at least, that's how it looks to me— they get thrown out of Paradise, and then they're in history, and history is a place where there's pain in childbirth, and where you're dominated by your mate, and where you have to toil like mad—like no other animal because you're aware of the future. You have to work and sacrifice the joys of the present for the future—constantly! And you know you're going to die. You have all that weight on you. To me, again, that's just— how can anything be more true than that?"

The existentialists said people feel like they have a debt that they have to pay off to existence for the crime of their Being. Something like that. Maybe it's because we're acutely aware that we have to offer something of value to the people around us so that they can tolerate us.

It's very interesting because in the Adam and Eve story, there's two— there's two catastrophes, essentially. There's the catastrophe that occurs when Adam and Eve wake up—which we'll talk about in detail— and become self-conscious and know they're naked. And their eyes are opened, right? That's the terminology that's used, and to have your eyes opened means to have a... an increment in consciousness, essentially.

The classic interpretation of that is it has something to do with sexual sin, and I don't believe that. I don't believe that's what it means. Although there are elements about that that're relevant. It's more that to realize that you're naked... It's like—y'know, if you dream that you're naked and on a stage in front of people, that's not a sexual dream, man!

And that makes people self-conscious. That's a real human state—it's associated with neuroticism in the Big Five trait model, but people don't like that at all. They don't like having their fragility and vulnerability exposed to the group. It's one of the two major fears of people. 'Cause one is social humiliation.

[laughter] Requested P offer his look at human's appointment to further create. Here's something interesting too; we will develop this a lot. You see, when Adam and Eve eat the fruit, when the snake gives them the fruit, the thing that happens is their eyes are opened. Okay, to me that means that they've woken up. there's been an increment in their consciousness. The next thing that happens is they recognize that they're naked. To recognize that you're naked is to recognize that you're vulnerable."

So it's a very profound shock for them to recognize that they're naked. It even makes Adam hide from God. Then they develop the knowledge of good and evil. Well, I think because, you see, human beings have this peculiar capacity that no other creature has, which is I know how I can be hurt, because I am aware of my own limitations. Painfully aware. And now because I know how I can be hurt, I know how you can be hurt. And I can take advantage of that. And that's how evil enters the world. That's how it looks like to me.

I don't think you can lay that precisely at God's feet. Now people have been arguing about that for a very long time. The question for me that arose from that. Fine, like tragedy, you can lay that at God's feet. Well if we didn't bring additional evil into the world, could we tolerate the tragedy of being without becoming corrupt? Well I think generally the answer to that is:Yes, as I've seen people react quite heroically to the arbitrary burdens of their life."

    "text": "[Music] hello everyone so hopefully we're going to get past Genesis 1 today that's the theory so I finished my new book yesterday [Applause] yes that's that's taken about three years of writing it's quite a long time to write something so yeah it's done except for the mopping up you know copy editing and that sort of thing so hopefully it's as good as I can make it I don't know if that's any good but it's as good as I can make it anyways all right so this is the stories that I'm gonna tell you tonight I've been thinking about well like the ones last week for that matter for a very long period of time but I think these even longer and one of the things that I just do not understand I cannot fathom this I I cannot understand how there can be so much information in such tiny little stories especially the story of Cain and Abel that story just every time I read it it just flattens me because it it's only like a paragraph long there's just nothing to it you know and I think about it I think about it and I think about it I think about it and every time I think about it another layer comes out from underneath and then another layer comes out for underneath it and I can't figure that out like you know the rational approach that I've been describing to you is predicated on the idea that these stories have somehow encapsulated wisdom that we generated interpersonally and behaviorally and that an image over very vast stretches of time and then condensed it into very very dense articulated words that are then further refined by the act of being remembered and transmitted and remembered and transmitted and remembered and transmitted over vast stretches of time and that's a pretty good argument I'm willing to I'm willing to go with it but it still never ceases to amaze me how much information such tiny little passages can can contain so we'll take that apart today and I think it's especially true with the story of Cain and Abel because it it works on the individual level and it works on the familial level and it works on the political level and it works at the level of warfare and it works at the level of economics and it's that's a lot for a little tiny one-paragraph story to cover man now you know you could object well with these stories you never know what you're reading into it and what's in the story right that's part of let's call it the postmodern dilemma and and fair enough and there's really no answer to that any more than there is an answer to how do you know your interpretation of the world is well let's not say correct but sufficient there's some answer to that it's it's sufficient in if you can act it out in the world and other people don't object too much and you don't die and nature doesn't take a bite out of you any more often than necessary you know those are the constraints within which we live so it you have some way of determining whether your interpretation is at least functionally successful and that's and that's not trivial and I guess you can say the same thing to the interpretations that might be laid out on these stories and at the moment that's probably good enough hopefully you find the interpretations functionally significant at multiple levels and I also think the chance of managing that by chance is very very small you know to be able to pull off an interpretation of a story that works at multiple levels simultaneously you think with each level that it applies the chances that you've stumbled across something by chance have to be decreasing right that there's a technical term for that in psychology it's called something like multi method multi trait method of determining whether or not something is accurate and the idea is them the more ways that you can measure it and get the same result the more confident you can be that you're not just deluding yourself with your a priori hypothesis you know that there's actually something out there so I guess that's another part of this method is that and it's also a method that I use in my in my speaking I think I don't try to tell people anything that isn't personally relevant you know because you should know why you are being taught something right you should know what the fact is good for and then it should be good for you personally at least in some sense and then if you act it out in the world it should be good for your family and maybe should have some significance for the broader community and I think that's what meaning means and I don't really see the utility in being taught things that aren't meaningful facts that aren't meaningful because there's an infinite number of facts and there's no way you're going to remember all of them they have to be they have to have the aspect of tools essentially something like that because we are tool using creatures while these these stories have that aspect is as far as I can tell there's nothing there's no doubt about that so here's the stories in Genesis two very famous stories obviously virtually everybody who's even vaguely versed in Western roughly speaking Western Western culture knows these stories and that's something that's interesting too that stories can be so foundational that everybody shares them I mean you can say the same thing about a fairly large handful of fairy tales as well or you could at least until recently but the fact that stories are foundational I think also means that they have to be given a kind of well even if you don't give them any respect you have to at least treat them as remarkable curiosities so why those stories and why did they stick around and why does everybody know them and it's not self-evident by any stretch of the imagination and you can use explanations can use the Freudian explanation Freud sort of thought that the judeo-christian was predicated on the idea that the figure of the father the familial father was expanded up into cosmic dimensions so that mankind existed in the same relationship to the cosmic father let's say that an infant or a small child existed in relationship to his or her own father and that's a reasonable critique I would say to some degree but it does and and and this was purposeful it does imply more than imply and for its case that people who adopt religious belief that has a personified figure as at its apex are essentially acting out the role of dependent children and you know I thought about that critique for a long time and believe me that's been a powerful critique one of the best books I've ever read called the denial of death by Ernest Becker I think took that line of argumentation it developed it as well as any any book I've ever seen argue it Becker tried to bring closure to Freudian psychoanalysis on religion he did a pretty wicked job of it like I think the book is seriously flawed and wrong but it's really a great book like some books are well some books are wrong in really good ways right they make a powerful powerful argument they really take it to its extreme I think Becker missed the point and he missed it in the same way that Freud missed Jung's point and Becker who wrote this book on the psychology the psychoanalysis of religion never referred to Jung except very briefly in the introduction and I think that was a major mistake but Becker took the argument that the hypothesis of God is nothing but an attempt by human beings to recreate quasi infantile state of dependency and to be able to rely on an all-knowing father and to thereby recover the comfort perhaps that we experienced when we were young and had a hypothetically all-knowing father for those of us who were lucky to have someone who rigged vaguely resembled that but the more I thought about that the more that struck me is quite implausible across time Charles Taylor I think it was Charles Taylor wrote an interesting book called the I think it was called the origins of the modern self he's a megillah' philosopher and I wouldn't necessarily call him a friend of classic religion but it doesn't matter he made a very interesting point about Christianity in particular he said well if you're going to invent a religion that offered you nothing but infantile comfort why in the world would you bother with conceptualizing hell that just seems like an unnecessary detail to add to the whole story right if it's it's all about comfort why would you hypothesize that the consequence of of serious error was eternal torment that doesn't really sound very it isn't the sort of thing that that is likely to make you feel comfortable James Joyce when he wrote about that said he had terrible nightmares when he was a child because of the Hellfire sermons that Jesuits used to spew forth let's say and he wrote down what he remembered of them and they were pretty hair-raising I think in James Joyce's book I think it was portrait of the artist of a young man man he talked about the Jesuits telling them and telling him that hell was a like a prison with walls that were seven miles thick that was always in darkness and consumed by fire and that the people who were trapped there were continually burnt by this dark fire that gave new light which also simultaneously rejuvenated their flesh so that it could be burnt off eternally in case you were wondering how it was going to be burned off eternally that's apparently the process it's not easy for me to see that as an infantile wish-fulfillment I'm afraid now you could well you could be a cynic about it and Elaine Pagels who wrote a book on the devil was cynical about it in this manner she thought that the Christians so to speak invented hell as a place to put their enemies and you know yeah fair enough but no that's not accurate really well although it's convenient to have a place to put your enemies Charles Taylor did point out for example that the modern terror of loss of self let's say the existential loss of self and loss of meaning was perhaps roughly paralleled by the medieval terror of Hell you know in terms of existential intensity and so it wasn't hell wasn't merely a place where those people that you didn't care for would end up it was the place where you were going to go if he didn't walk the line properly and so I don't think Freud's Freud's critique really holds water in the final analysis and then Marx's critique of course was that religion was the opiate of the masses and he made an argument that was similar to Freud's although somewhat earlier and made the based upon the presupposition that religious beliefs were stories told to the gullible masses in order to keep them pacified and happy well their corporate overlords for lack of a better purpose continue to exploit them and and and weaken them and you know I find that I find the critique of human institutions as driven entirely by power very let's say questionable to to say the least and of course every human institution is corrupted by corrupted is corrupt by for one reason or another and it's also corrupt specifically by such things as deception and arrogance and and the demand for unearned power and the same thing of course can be applied to religious systems but that doesn't mean that they are in some special way characteristic of those false and maybe you think they are and you know maybe you can make a case for it but it's not prime FSA I think that's how you say that evident that that is that also is a particularly useful criticism I don't buy it I think there's I think that's far too cynical I think that the people who wrote these stories first of all what are you gonna do you cannot really you're gonna run a bloody conspiracy for three thousand years successfully it's like good luck with that can't run a conspiracy for fifteen minutes without somebody ratting you out you know it's it's impossible so whatever's at the basis of the construction not only of these stories but of the dogmatic structures that emerged from them I think that it's a terrible mistake to reduce them to you know dimensional explanations in fact I generally think that reducing any complex human behavior to yoona dimensional explanation is often the sign of a seriously limited thinker and you know I say that with some caution because Freud did do that with religion at least to some degree and so it was a serious thinker and Marx I suppose was a serious thing or two even though well yeah is he someone you just if you have any sense marks just leaves you speechless so so anyway so that's all to say that I don't think there's any simple explanation for how these stories have the power that they have I I really don't I don't think you can reduce it to political conspiracy that's for sure I don't think you can reduce it to psychological infantilism I think you can make a case like I have that they are repositories of the collective wisdom of the human race I had an interesting letter this week from someone I get a lot of interesting letters I think I'm going to make an archive out of them and put them on the web at some point with people's permission obviously and he said that he'd been following my lectures and noted that I had been making what you might describe as a quasi biological or evolutionary case for for the emergence of the information that the stories contained and he said well how do you know that someone from a different religious tradition or speaking of a different religious tradition couldn't do exactly the same thing and I thought well first of all to some degree they could because there is overlap like I've talked to you a little bit about Taoism for example in the Taoist view of being as you know the eternal balance between chaos and order one thing I didn't tell you I don't think about that and I don't know if you know this but there's a neuropsychologist named Al Conan Goldberg who was a student of Alexander Luria and Luria was I think the greatest neuropsychologist of the 20th century he was a Russian and he was one of the first people to really determine in large part the function of the frontal cortex which was quite a mystery for a very long period of time and Goldberg you know you know how we have two hemispheres right we have a left hemisphere and a right hemisphere and people often think of the left for right-handed people right-handed males more particularly because women are more neurologically diffuse it's one of the things that makes them more robust to head injury for example and maybe men are less defuses somewhat more specialized which makes them a bit more specialized but a little more subject to damage anyways we have two hemispheres left the right and no one exactly knows why and we know that they how is quasi independent consciousness is because if you divide the corpus callosum that that unites them which was done to in cases of intractable epilepsy for example that each hemisphere is capable of developing its own consciousness to some degree the right generally nonverbal and the left verbal and so there has been this idea that the left is a verbal Hemisphere and the right is a nonverbal hemisphere but that can't be right because of course animals don't talk and they have a bifurcated hemisphere so if it's right it's not causally right now goldberg hypothesized instead that the hemispheres were were specialized for routinization and non routinization or for novelty and familiarity or for chaos and order and so that's pretty damn cool when i ran across that i also thought about that as a as a signal of what would you call it Multi method multi trait construct validation because I'd never thought of the hemispheres as operating that way and Goldberg came up with this in a in a historical pathway that was entirely independent from any mythologically inspired thinking completely independent in fact it was motivated more by materialist Russian neuro psychology which was materialist for political reasons and also for scientific reasons but the idea is that we have one hemisphere that reacts very rapidly to things we don't know and it's more imaginative and diffuse in it and it's associated more with negative emotion because negative emotion is what you should feel immediately when you encounter something you don't understand because it's a form of thinking right negative emotion it's like I'm somewhere where things aren't with what they should be right hemisphere does that generates images very rapidly to help you figure out what might be there and then the left hemisphere takes that and develops it into something that's more articulated and and algorithmic and fully understood and so then there's this dynamic balance between the right and the left hemisphere where the left tries to impose order on the world that's Ramachandran who's a neurologist in in california very famous neuro neuro neurologist who also developed a theory like goldberg who said that the left hemisphere imposes routinized order on the world and the right hemisphere generates novelty and and and reacts to novelty and generates novel hypotheses and he thought and there is some good evidence for this that's what's happening during the dream is that information is moved from the right hemisphere to the left hemisphere in small doses basically so that the novel revelations of the right hemisphere don't demolish the algorithmic structures that the left hemisphere has so carefully put together so and I like that theory too because it also does help justify the hypothesis that I'd be laying out for you which is that you know there's part of us that extends ourselves out into the world interest to understand what we don't know and that that part extends itself out with behavior and also with emotion and also with image and then maybe with poetry and then maybe with storytelling and then as that develops then we develop more and more articulated representations of that emergent knowledge and so you can map that quite nicely onto the neurologists and the neuropsychologists presumption about what constitutes the reason for the hemispheric differentiation but the other thing that's so cool about the hemispheric differentiation argument as far as I'm concerned and this is really this is worth thinking about man because it's a real it's a real there's a word that Ned's Ned Flanders uses for that Norgan scratcher I think it's something like that anyways you know we do make the assumption that what it is that we are biologically adapted to is reality right it's actually an axiomatic definition if you're a Darwinian because nature is what selects by definition that's what nature is its what selects and if the nature that selects has forced upon you a dual hemispheric structure because half of you has to deal with the chaos and half the half of you has to deal with order then you can make a pretty damn strong inferential case that the world is made out of chaos and order and that's really something to that's really something to think about man you know so you can think about that for a while if you want so anyways for whatever reason there is a lot too packed into these stories and so let's investigate a couple more of them we'll start with this story by of Adam and Eve now you may remember that the Bible is a series of books Bible actually means something akin to library and these books were written by all sorts of different people and groups of people and groups of editors and groups of people who edited over and over across very very large periods of time so they're offered by no one and many at the same time the there was a tradition for a long time that the earliest books were written by Moses but that that's probably not technically correct even though it might be dramatically correct let's say or correct in the way that a fairy tale is correct and I'm I'm not trying to put down fairy tales by saying that but there's a number of authors and the way the authors have been identified tentatively is by certain stylistic commonalities across the different stories different uses of words like the words for God different poetic styles different topics and so forth and people have been working for probably 200 years roughly that to try to sort out who wrote what and how that was all cobble together but it doesn't really matter for our purposes what matters is that it's an aggregation of collected narrative traditions and maybe you could say it's an aggregation of collective narrative wisdom we don't have to go that far but we can at least say it's aggregated narrative traditions and that there was some reason that those traditions and all others were kept and that there was some reasons complex though they may have been why they were sequenced in the order that they were sequenced because one of the things that's really remarkable about the Bible as an as a document is that it actually has a plot and that's really something I mean it's it's sprawling and it goes many places but the fact that something's being cobbled together over several thousand years maybe four thousand years maybe longer than that if you include the oral traditions that preceded it and god only knows how old those are that that collective imagination part of the human collective imagination has cobble together a library with a plot and like I see the Bible as an attempt a collective attempt by hee you solve the deepest problems that we have and I think those problems are the problems of primarily that the problem of self-consciousness the fact that not only do we are immortal and that we die but that we know it and that's the unique that's the unique predicament of human beings and it makes all the difference and I think that's laid out in Adam and Eve in the story of Adam and Eve I think the reason that that makes us unique and is laid out in that story and interestingly and I really realized this only after I was doing the last three lectures so the Bible presents a cataclysm and okay a Cataclysm at the beginning of the top of Time which is the emergence of self-consciousness and human beings which puts a rift into the structure of being that's the right way to think about it and that's really given cosmic significance now you can dispense with out and say well nothing that happens to human beings does have caused me significance because we're these short-lived you know mold like entities that are like cancers on this tiny little planet that's rotating out in the middle of nowhere on the edge of some unknown galaxy in the middle of infinite space and nothing that happens to us matters and it's fine you like you can walk down that road if you want I wouldn't recommend it I mean and that's part of the reason I think that for all intents and purposes it's untrue you know it isn't it isn't a road you can walk down and live well in fact I think if you really walk down that road and you really take it seriously you end up not living at all so it's certainly very reminiscent I mean I've talked to lots of people who were suicidal and seriously suicidal and you know the kind of conclusions that they draw both the utility of life prior to wishing for its cessation are very much like the kind of conclusions that you draw if you walk down that particular line of reasoning long enough if you're interested in that you could read Tolstoy his confessions Leo Tolstoy's confession it's a very short book it's a it's a killer man it's it's a powerful book very very short and Tolstoy describes his obsession with suicide when he was at the height of his fame most well-known author in the world you know huge family international fame wealth beyond anyone's imagining at that time influential admired he everything that you could possibly imagine that everyone could have and for years he was afraid to go out into his barn with a rope or a gun because he thought he'd either hang himself or shoot himself and he did get out of that he and he describes why that happened and where he went when that happened so if you're interested in that that's a very good book but so the biblical stories and starting with Adam and Eve they present a different story they present the emergence of self-consciousness in human beings as cosmically cataclysmic event and you could say well what do we have to do with the cosmos and the answer to that is it depends on what you think consciousness has to do with the cosmos and perhaps that's nothing and perhaps it's everything I'm going to go with everything because that's how it looks to me now of course anyone who wishes to is welcome to disagree but if you believe that consciousness is a force of cosmic significance which Britt which which being itself is dependent on in any real sense at least in any experience will sense that it's that it's not unreasonable to assume that radical restructurings of consciousness can worthily be granted some kind of cosmic or metaphysical significance and even if it's not true from outside the human perspective whatever that might be it's bloody well true from within the human perspective that's for sure and so that's the that's the initial event in some sense after the creation is the cataclysmic fall and then the entire rest of the Bible is an attempt to figure out what the hell to do about that and everything in it is is and so you could say for example in the earliest in the Old Testament stories what seems to happen is that the State of Israel is is founded and it rises and falls and rises and falls and so there's this experimentation for centuries millennia even with the idea that the way that you protect yourself against the tragic consequences of self consciousness is by organizing yourself into a state but then what happens is the state itself begins to reveal its pathologies and as those pathologies mount the state becomes an unstable and collapses and then it rises back up and becomes unstable and collapses and then it rises back up after it does this a number of times.this is primarily from Northrup fries interpretations people start wondering if there's not something wrong with the idea that the state itself is this is the is the pathway is the place of redemption that there's something wrong with that idea and so then I think on on the heels of that comes the Christian revolution with its hypothesis that it's not the state that's that's the place of salvation it's the individual psyche and then there's there's a there's a an ethic that goes along with that too which is quite interesting so the ethic of redemption after the state experiment fails let's say is that it's it's the it's within the individual that Redemption can be manifested let's say and even insofar as the state is concerned because the state's proper functioning is dependent on the proper functioning of the individual rather than the reverse most fundamentally and that the proper mode of individual being that's redemptive is truth and truth is the antidote to the suffering that's that emerges with the fall of man in the story of Adam and Eve and then that relates back to the chapters that we've already talked about because there's this insistence in Genesis 1 that it's the word in the form of the of truth that generates order out of chaos but even more importantly and this is something like I said I most clearly realize just doing these lectures for the last three weeks is God continues to say as he speaks order into being with truth that the being he speaks into being is good and so there's this insistence that the being that spoke into being through truth is good and so there's a hint there it's so interesting there's a hint there right at the beginning of the story that the the state of being that Adam and Eve inhabited before they fell before they became self consciousness conscious insofar as they were made in the image of God and acting out the truth that that being itself was properly balanced and it takes the entire Bible to rediscover that which is a which is a journey back to the beginning right and that's a classic theme it's a classic mythological theme that the wise person is the person who finds what they lost in childhood and regains it right so that's a I think that's a Jewish idea this is addict if I remember correctly who is a messiah figure is the person who finds what he lost in childhood and regains it his idea of this return to the beginning except that the return is you don't fall backwards into childhood and unconsciousness you returned voluntarily to the state of childhood well awake and then determined to participate through truth in the manifestation of proper being now you know I'm a psychologist and I've taught personality theory for a very long time and I know personality theory is that profound personality theory is pretty well and I'm reasonably well versed in philosophy although not as well-versed as I should be but I can tell you and all the things I've ever read or encountered or thought about I have never once found an idea that matches that in terms of profundity but not only profundity also in believability because the other thing I see is a clinician and I think this is a very characteristic of clinical experience and also very much described explicitly by the great clinicians is that what cures in therapy is truth that's the curative now there's exposure to the things you're afraid of and avoiding as well but I would say that's a form of enacted truth because if you know there's something you should do by your own set of rules and you're avoiding it then you're enacting a lot you know you're not telling one but you're acting one out it's the same damn thing so if I can get you to face what it is that you're confronting that you know you shouldn't be avoiding then what's happening is that we're both partaking in the process of attempting you to act out your deepest truth and what happens is that that improves people's lives and it improves them radically and the evidence of the clinical evidence for that is overwhelming we know that if you expose people to the things they're afraid of but that they're avoiding they get better and you have to do it carefully and cautiously and with their own participation in all of that but of all the things that clinicians have established that's credible that's number one and that's nested inside this deeper realization that the clinical experience is redemptive let's say because it it's designed to address suffering insofar as the people who are engaged in the process are both telling each other the truth and then you think well obviously because if if you have some problems and you come to talk to me about them well first of all just by coming to talk to me about them you've admitted that they exist now and that's a pretty good start and second well if you tell me about them then we know what they are and then if we know what they are we can maybe start to lay out some solutions and then you can go act out the solutions and see if they work but if you don't admit they're there and you won't tell me what they are and I don't and I'm like posturing and and and acting egotistically and and taking the upper hand and all of that in our discussions well how the hell is that going to work you know it might be comfortable moment to moment while we stay encapsulated in our delusion but it's not going to work so a lot of that seems if you think it through it seems pretty self-evident and you know Freud thought that repression was at the heart of much mental suffering the difference between repression and deception is a matter of degree and that's all its technical it's a technical differentiation and Alfred Adler who was one of Freud's greatest associates say and much underappreciated I would say he thought that people got into problems because they started to act out a life lie that's what he called it a life lie that's worth looking up because I have there although not as charismatic as Freud was very practical and and and really foreshadowed a lot of later developments in cybernetic theory and of course you believed that you could bypass psychotherapy entirely by merely making a proper moral effort in your own life and Carl Rogers believed that it was honest communication mediated through dialogue that had redemptive consequences and the behaviors believe that you do a careful micro analysis of the problems that are laid before you and help introduce people to what they're avoiding it's like all of those things to me are just secular variations of the notion that truth will set you free essentially so so you know it's a pretty powerful story and a it's not that easy to dispense with and B the other thing is you dispense with it at your peril because what I have seen as well is that the people that I've seen who've been have been hurt mostly by deceit and that's also worth thinking about that you know you get walloped by life there's no doubt about that absolutely no doubt about that but I've thought for a long time that maybe maybe maybe people can hang handle earthquakes and cancer and even death Meany but they can't handle betrayal and they can't handle deception they can't handle having the rug pulled out from underneath and by people that they love and trust that just does them in you know it it it it makes the meal but it does where it hurts them you know psycho physiologically it damages them but more than that it makes them cynical and bitter and vicious and resentful and then they also start to act all that out in the world and that makes it worse so so you know this story starts god uses the spoken truth to create being that is good and then the Cataclysm occurs and then human beings spend until millennia trying to sort out exactly what to do about the fact that they've become self conscious and you know by the way we have right we are in fact self conscious no other animal has that distinction now you'll read that chimpanzees can for example if you put lipstick on a chimpanzee it's kind of a strange thing to do yeah well I won't pursue that any further but the chimp a chimpanzee will wipe off the lipstick if you show it a mirror and dolphins seem to be able to recognize themselves in mirrors and there is so there is the glimmerings of self conscious recognition and other animals but to put that in the same conceptual category as human self-consciousness is to my way of thinking it's it's well it's uninformed to say the least but I also think that it's motivated it's motivated by a kind of anti humanistic underlying an underlying motivation because our self-consciousness is so incredibly developed compared to that that they're hardly in the same conceptual universe it's it's like comparing the the alarm cries of vervet monkeys when they see a predator to the language of human beings it's like yeah yeah yeah there's some similarities man there are other iNSYS and there are other insisting but they're not language and the self-consciousness of animals is proto self-consciousness and it's only there in a very small number of animals and it's it's nothing like ours they're not aware of the future like we are they're not aware of their boundaries in space and time and that's the critical thing and most particularly time human beings discovered time and when we discover time we discovered the end of each of our being and that made all the difference and that's what the story of Adam and Eve is about so genesis ones derived from the priestly source where God is known as Elohim or El Shaddai and there's God in the singular and there's gods in the plural and I suppose that's because it seems that if you analyze the history of the development of monotheistic ideas that monotheism emerges out of a plurality of gods and as I mentioned I think it's because the gods represent fundamental forces at minimum and those fundamental forces have to be hierarchy to be organized for with some with something absolute at the top because otherwise they do nothing but war like you have to organize your values hierarchically or you stay confused and that's true if you're an individual and it it's true if you're a state if you don't know what the next thing you should do is then there's 50 things you should do and then how are you gonna do any of them you can't you have to prioritize something has to be above something else it has to be arranged in a hierarchy for it not to be chaotic and so there's some principle at the top of the hierarchy and maybe the organization of the gods over time that's the battle of gods that Mircea Eliade i talked about and if you're interested in that you could read a history of religious ideas which I would really recommend it's a three-volume book it's actually quite as straightforward read as far as these things go and Elliott it does a very nice job of describing how and even why polytheism tends towards monotheism even in polytheistic cultures there's a strong tendency for the gods to organize themselves in a hierarchy with one God at the top in a monotheistic culture and some in some sense all the other gods disappear across time and there's nothing left but the top god but even in a polytheistic society there's a hierarchy of power among the gods the first story is newer than the second one so the story I'm going to tell you today is actually older than the one I already told you even though their order was flipped by the redactor who's the hypothetical person or persons who edited these stories together and we don't know exactly why he or the committee or what I suspect it was a single person but who knows we don't know why the stories were edited together in the order that they were added together but we could infer I mean they were added together in that order because the editor thought they made sense that way because that's what an editor does right an editor tends to take diverse ideas and then to organize them in some manner that makes sense and part of the manner that makes sense is that you can tell them to people and the people stay interested and you can tell them to people and people remember them that's that's one of the ways you can tell if you've got an argument right because it's communicable and understandable and memorable and so he this person was let's say motivated by intuition to organize the stories in this particular manner so the second the yahwist strand contains the stories the classic stories in the Pentateuch that's five books Genesis Exodus Leviticus numbers and Deuteronomy which we'll try to get through perhaps in these twelve lectures with Steve we'll see how that goes it's strongly under for Norfolk so the God in the August account is for all intents and purposes a sort of meta person and I dealt with that a little bit last week because people tend to you know think of that as unsophisticated but when you think that the mind that the the ground of consciousness is the most complex thing that we know of then it's not so unsophisticated to assume that the most complex thing that there might be is like that or it's at least it's as good as we can do with our imaginations and so I don't think it's so it's so it's so unsophisticated it's also the case and this is practically speaking is that it is not at all unreasonable to think of God the Father as the spirit that arises from the cry that exists into the future right and that's we talked about that in relationship to the idea of sacrifice at least a little bit tomorrow or we're going to you make sacrifices in the present so that the future is happy with you and the question is what is that future that would be happy with you and the answer to that is it's the spirit of humanity that's that's who you're negotiating with because you make the assumption that if you forego impulsive pleasure and get your medical degree that when you're done in ten years and you're a physician humanity as such will honor your sacrifice and commitment and open the doors to you right so you're treating the future as if it's a single being and you're also treating it as if it's a something like a compassionate judge you're acting that out and maybe we had to imagine God in that form before we could understand once we started to understand that there was a future perhaps we had to imagine God in that form in order to concretize something that we could bargain with so that we could figure out how to use sacrifice to figure out how to guide ourselves into the future because I sacrifice as a contract with the future but it's not a contract with any particular person it's it's a contract with the spirit of humanity as such it's something like that and so when you think about it that way that should make you faint with amazement because that is such a bloody amazing idea to come up with that idea that you can bargain with the future that is some idea man that's that's like the major idea of human of humankind we suffer what do we do about it we figure out how to bargain with the future and we minimize suffering in that manner it's like no other animal does that either you know like the Lions they just eat everything I think a wolf can eat forty pounds of meat in a single sitting right it's like there's some meat eat it it's light not like save some mammoths for tomorrow that's a that's that's not a wolf thing man that's a human thing and that might mean you have to be hungry today or maybe you're a farmer you know several thousand years ago six thousand years ago or so what agriculture first got going and you're starving to death waiting for the spring planting and you think we bill it bloody well better not eat those seeds right and that's really something to be able to control yourself to make the future real to put off what you could use today and not just in some and Paul of manner man maybe your kids are starving to death you think we are not touching the seeds that we need for the future and for human beings to have discovered that and then to also have figured out that we could bargain with the future it's like man that's something and I think that that I think that the stories that are laid out in this book actually describe at least in part the process by which that occurred the always stories begin with Genesis 2:4 this is the account of the heavens and the earth wind so there's two real creation stories at the beginning the newer one which is the first one and the older one which is the second one and the older one begins in Chapter two and that's the story that we're going to that we are getting into now Adam and Eve are in that Cain and Abel knoweth the Tower of Babel in the August strand Exodus numbers along and there's some of the priestly version in there too as well as the Ten Commandments well there's some lovely representations of of paradise this is Garden of Earthly Delights what's his name say that oh yes Hieronymous Bosch he has a crazy I mean if you how he didn't get burnt at the stake is absolutely beyond me I mean you know some of you know about salvador deli i suppose most of you do I mean delis a [ __ ] compared to Hieronymous Bosch man you could spend because there's three pieces of this particular painting you could spend a very bizarre and surreal month looking at that painting I don't know what it was with Bosch but he was some sort of creature that only popped up once and probably for the best and so there's been very many representations of paradise maybe god only knows what that is it's like I could probably guess but I won't and then look I mean that's that's that's the lion lying down with the lamb right so that's this idea that's it's maybe projected back in time that there was a time or maybe will be a time when when that then the horrors of life are no longer necessary for life itself to exist right and the horrors of life are of course that everything eats everything else and that everything dies and that everything's born and that the whole bloody place is at Arnel house and it's it's a catastrophe from beginning to end and this is this is the vision of it being other than that and you know there's a strong idea this is also in implicit in the alchemical ideas and I think it's also implicit in the Scientific Revolution that human beings can interact with reality in such a way so that the tragic and evil elements of it can be mitigated and so that we can move somewhat closer to a state that might be characterized that's obviously imagistic but it might be characterized by something like that where we have the benefits of actual existence without all of the catastrophe that seems to go along with it and Carl Jung when he wrote about the emergence of alchemy or the emergence of science from alchemy he thought of science as being motivated by a dream because for Jung dream was the dream was the manifestation of the instincts it was the boundary between the instincts and thinking said well science is nested inside a dream and the dream is that if we investigated the structures of material reality with sufficient attention and truth that we could then learn enough about material reality to alleviate suffering right to produce the Philosopher's Stone to make everybody wealthy to make everybody healthy to make everyone live as long as they wanted to live for perhaps forever that that's the goal to alleviate the catastrophe of existence and that that idea the idea that mysteries the solution to the mysteries of life that might enable us to develop such a substance or let's say a multitude of substances provided the motive force for the development of science and young trace that the development of that mode of force really over a thousand years and if you're interested in reading his books on alchemy which are extraordinarily difficult and that's really saying something about young because all of his books are difficult and then the books on alchemy they kind of take a quantum leap that's actually a very small leap so I shouldn't say that they take a massive leap into a whole different dimension of complexity but that's what he was trying to get at he went back into the alchemical texts and interpreted them as if they were the dream on which science was founded Newton was an alchemist by the way I mean Jung's hypotheses are certainly well supported by the historical fact science did emerge out of alchemy the question is what were the alchemists up to and they were trying to produce the Philosopher's Stone and that was the you know so medica meant for mankind's pathology Jung felt that what had happened was that you know Christianity had promised that the cessation of suffering promised it for a thousand years and yet suffering went on unabated and at the same time Christianity had attempted to really put emphasis on spiritual development let's say at the expense of material development right thinking of material development as something akin to a sin trying to get a control of impulsivity and and all the things that went along with a to embodied existence there was a reason for it but that by about a thousand AD the European mind somewhat educated by that point someone able to concentrate on a single point perhaps because of a very long history of intense religious training turned its dream to the unexplored material world and thought well you know the spiritual Redemption that we've been seeking didn't appear to produce the result that was promised or intended and so maybe there's another place that we should look and that was in the Damned material world right which which which was supposed to be at least according to some elements of classic thinking nothing about the creation of the devil so but the point I'm making is that you know it's very difficult to underestimate the amount of human motivation that's embedded in the attempt to alleviate suffering to eradicate disease to help people live a healthy a healthy life and well that's the disease obviously but to live a long life as well and to make things as peaceful as possible I mean you can be cynical about people and you too can talk about them as motivated by power and being corrupt in all of those things and all of those things are true but you shouldn't throw away the baby with the bathwater because we have been striving for a very long time to set things right and we've done actually not too bad a job of it for half starving crazy insect ridden chimpanzees with lifespans of 50 to 70 years so you know we could deserve a bit of sympathy for our position as far as I'm concerned so [Applause] some other representations this one I like the one on the left that's para de perak dice has a walled garden and that's what paradise means it's paradise I was which is I don't remember the language it's a it's a it's a it's associated with Persian Paradiso means walled garden and why a walled garden well it goes back to the chaos order idea so this is where God puts man and woman after the creation in a walled garden well the wall is culture and order in the garden is nature and the idea is the proper human habitat is nature and culture in balance and swell we like Gardens well why because well they're not completely covered with weeds and mosquitoes and black flies right so they're civilized a little bit but still within that civilization nature in its more benevolent guys is encouraged to flourish and people find that rejuvenating and so the idea that paradise the proper habitat of a human being is a walled garden is a good one and it's walled because well you want to keep things out right I mean raccoons for example if you want want to keep those things out man even though it's impossible and you know you don't you don't want well there's all sorts of things you don't want your garden like snakes walls don't seem to be much use against them but the idea that paradise is a walled garden is is a an echo back to the chaos order idea walls culture right garden nature so the proper human habitat is a properly tended garden now the radical left-leaning anti theist environmentalists tend to make the case that the predations of the Western capitalist system are a consequence of the injunction that was delivered in Genesis by God to man to go out and dominate the earth David Suzuki has talked a lot about this by the way they believe that that statement has given rise to our inappropriate assumption that we have the right to exert control over the world and that that's what's turned us into these terror predatory monsters sometimes described as cancers on the face of the earth or viruses that have inhabited the entire ecosystem who are doing nothing but one wandering everywhere and wreaking havoc as rapidly as we possibly can which is another perspective on the essential element of humankind that I find absolutely deplorable I mean if you look at the historical record for example even casually you'll find out that as early as as late as the late 1800s 1895 thereabouts Thomas Huxley who was Aldous Huxley's grandfather and a great defender of Darwin prepared a report for the British government on ocean sustainability and his conclusion was huh fish away guys man there's so many fish out there the oceans are so inexhaustible that no matter how hard humanity tried for for any number of years the probability that we could do more than put a dent in what was out there was zero now Huxley turned out to be wrong he didn't realize that our population was going to spike so dramatically partly because we got a little bit rich and our children stopped dying at the rate of like 60% before they were 1 years old and you know we actually managed to populate the you earth with a few people but wasn't really until 1960 or so that we woke up to the fact that there were so many of us that we actually hard to start paying attention to what we were doing to the planet and that's like what 50 years ago well we've just started to develop the technology or the wherewithal to understand that the whole world might be well considered a garden and we need to live inside the proper balance between culture and order or culture and and and chaos before that we were spending all of our time just trying not to die and we usually very unsuccessfully so so I don't agree with that interpretation of the opening sections of Genesis I don't believe that it's given human being is the right to act as super predators on the planet I think that instead the proper environment for human beings is presented quite properly as a garden and that the role of people and that's explicitly stated in in the second story in Adam and Eve was to tend the garden and that means to make proper decisions and to make the sure that everything thrives and flourishes and and so that it's good for the things that are living there that aren't just people but also good for the people too so fine I think we can we could at least note that that's a slightly different take on the story than the than the ultimately cynical interpretation that's so commonly put forward today now inside that wall garden is a couple of trees and Adam and even some animals and all of that and unfortunately the tree happens to have a snake wrapped around it now that's an interesting thing we're gonna talk about that a lot and the snake in both of these representations is no ordinary snake say it's got a human head and it's got a human head there too so whatever that snake is well let's forget about looking at this from a religious perspective like if you can just imagine that you're an anthropologist and you've never seen this image before it's like what do you see or you see walls and you see something a fairly pleasant enclosure and then you see a tree and people are eating from the tree but the tree has the snake in it that has a human head and so then you might think well what's a snake with a human head and then you'd think well it's half snake and half human that's hardly revelatory it's just self evidence so whatever that snake is isn't just a snake it's snake and human or it's it's it's its snake and partakes in whatever human beings are and that's very important so we'll continue we'll consider that later and you see the same thing here and and you see in this particular version there's the head this one also has wings and so this is a winged snake sort of like a dragon and so it curls on the ground like a reptile and it's got an aerial aspect or a spiritual aspect so here it's a snake which is like the lowest form of reptilian life say something that crawls on the ground it's something that's human and it's something that's spiritual at the same time and it inhabits the tree which look a lot like magic mushrooms by the way and you can look that up if you want that's quite an interesting little rabbit hole to wander down if you're curious about it but but there's an idea here too is that there was something in the garden at the beginning of time that was like a snake that was like a person that was like something that was winged it was something spiritual so it's spiritual human and reptilian all at the same time and it's the animating spirit of the tree okay so keep that in mind thus the heavens and the earth were finished this is in relationship to Genesis 1 and all the host of them and on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made and God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it because that in it he had rested from all his work which God created and made that's wisdom in that one - I think the idea of the Sabbath you know because one of the things I've worked with a lot of people who were hyper conscientious and thing about hyper conscientious people is that they'll just work til they die and that's actually not very productive because then they're dead and they can't work and so what you have to do with hyper conscientious people is you have to say well I know you'd rather do nothing but work and maybe you're just as guilty as you can possibly be when you're not working but let's figure out what you're up to and what you're up to you know probability is the attempt to be productive in the least problematic longest sustaining possible manner and that might mean you have to take a rest and so one of the things I used to work with lawyers with people who had risen to the top of large law firms and they were hyper productive types they're often you know trying to hit their impossible quota for yearly hours and and burning themselves to a frazzle as a consequence and one of the things that we used to do was they couldn't work fewer hours because that a day that just didn't work but what we did was we have them take more time off you know like a four-day weekend every two months or something that was plotted out into the future and then we track their billable hours which is their degree of productivity it would actually increase so that was so cool because you could take hard-working people and you could say look you know take a break why well because you'll be more productive if you take a break no that couldn't possibly be like I should just work flat out all the time it's like let's test that out you take a break now on that it's like well what happened was their productivity would increase often by 10 percent so there's a there's wisdom here too which is okay and this is alludes to the Adam and Eve story near the end you you're self conscious you discover the future you have to work well then the question is how much should you work and one answer is you better bloody well work all the time because no matter how much work you do you're not solving your problems they're coming along man and you can stack up all the money you want you can stack up the wealth you want it is not going to protect you in the final analysis so you better be hitting the ground running and you better run flat-out all the time or what happens if you do that well then you die that's not a good solution so maybe you should rest and so how does that rest get instantiated well it's not easy to tell but one way to do it let's say conceptually is to say look even God had to rest one day a week and so you don't have to be so presumptuous to assume that if God had to rest one day a week that maybe you know you are allowed to work non-stop without a break at all you know and I think our culture has slipped into that in quite a dangerous way because everything is open all the time and I mean I'm I'm find that just as convenient as the rest of you but you know it's so strange to talk to modern people because one of the things they always tell you we say well how are you and what do they always say they don't say good they don't say bad they say busy it's like yeah well okay this is where Genesis 2 starts and we finally got there these are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when they were created in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens and every plant of the field before it was in the earth and every herb of the field before it grew for the Lord God had not caused it to rain upon the earth and there was not a man to till the ground but there went up a mist from the earth and watered the whole face of the ground and the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul well you know there's some archaic thinking and there the breath is life right that's psyche that's spirit that's inspiration that's respiration that's that's all associates its numa like pneumatic tyre it's its breath and the reason that people associated life with breath well that's not so foolish you know I mean you're breathing man and something you do all the time and when you die you start breathing and so the idea that there's something integral to life about breathing is a perfectly reasonable supposition it actually happens to be very true and though then to associate the act of creation with the act of first of all inspiration and respiration and and the breathing of life into something that was inanimate is is well what do you expect for a one-sentence description it's not a bad one sentence description you know so and the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden and Eden means well watered place and that's particularly relevant I suppose if you're a desert dweller right because the issue there is can you get enough water to make things grow and so the the walled garden which is paradise is also Eden which is a well watered place and water has the element of chaos we already saw that in relationship to Genesis 1 where the underlying chaos was often assimilated symbolically to water and so the idea too is that a certain amount of chaos has to be brought into the order in order for it to be fruitful and you can see that in the form of of allowing in the water and out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food The Tree of Life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil so two trees are marked out among the rest one is the Tree of Life and one is the tree of the knowledge of good and evil now you know you know when you read something like that if you're thinking about it that you're in a metaphorical space now we've got to be careful about metaphors because you know I could say and did that the chaos order idea is a metaphor but then I also said oh wait a second it's a metaphor but it's also what your brain is adapted to and so you know let's just not be pushing the idea that it's merely a metaphor too hard and then and the same thing is is here is happening here these are metaphors the Tree of Life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil but that doesn't exactly mean that they're mere metaphors because sometimes as I mentioned before and as if you have a set of things and you abstract out from them a common element you can make a strong case that the common element is more real than the set of things from which you extracted it that's the whole utility the abstraction why would you bother with it otherwise if you can't take a set of things and say look there's something in common across this set of things that's more important than the differences between them then you wouldn't bother abstracting at all and so the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil are abstractions now one of the questions is this is a tough one man I've been tried tried to figure out for a long time why a fruit and something you eat would be associated with the transformations of psychology because that's basically what happens in the Adam and Eve story why would it be something that you eat now Eric Newman who was one of young students had written a fair bit about this and got a fair ways with it he said well you know we do have noted we've noticed forever that the act of eating especially if you're hungry especially if you're starving produces a rapid spiritual transformation right I mean some of you this is worth knowing you probably have a Crabby partner or child because everyone does and one thing you might try is that if they get erratic during the day and you know get all volatile about nothing at all it's give them something to eat really I'll tell you man leave this solves for I do this with my clinical clients all the time it's like they say well I fly off the handle at the littlest things it's like okay yeah just try this for a week when you're crabby and unreasonable eat a piece of cheese or eat a peanut butter sandwich eat something that's high protein high fat and then just wait ten minutes and see if you're sane and you'll find out that you're saying after you eat so often that you just can't believe how crazy or when you're hungry look here's it's really absolutely bloody remarkable so I'm telling you try this it'll-it'll especially if you don't eat breakfast this will change your life and so here's a practical bit of information for you to for all of you antisocial types who are going to end up in prison so if you're in prison and you want to go on parole okay so you have to go in front of the judge and tell them why you're not gonna do it again so here's the deer's the deal it doesn't really matter what you did and it doesn't really matter what you promise what matters is whether you see the judge before lunch or after lunch because if you see the judge after lunch the probability that you'll get parole is 60% higher yeah right that is just like so never have an argument with your partner when you're hungry or when they're hungry especially if you want something for it from them it's like here's the sandwich they'll eat it then they'll be happy then you can manipulate them before before that man no [Applause] so you know it's it's not that unreasonable to think that there's a spirit in food because food rejuvenates and it just doesn't rejuvenate you physically it rejuvenates you spiritually and then of course there's the other things that we consume that aren't exactly like food that have a walloping spiritual impact like alcohol let's say which is a spirit and is regarded are nice yes right I mean it's the god of the vine and the god of the Varden possesses you and makes you act all the fun ways that alcohol makes you out you know the fun ways that you regret the next day and so there's the spiritual element of that too and and then but there's something even deeper that I think is so cool that's associated with food and information because the story of Adam and Eve represents the fruit as producing a psychological transformation and so the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is an abstraction across trees and it's trying to say here's something that's common across trees it's it's a fruit that's common across trees it's something like that and so the fruit across it's common across trees is something you might call food fair enough that's a generalization but here's something that's even more cool the food that's stable across the entire domain of food isn't food it's information it's information and we use the same bloody circuits in our brain to forage for information that squirrels used to forage for food that animals used to forage for food it's the same circuit and why is that because we figured out that knowing where things is knowing where the food is is more important than having the food and so so knowing where the food is as a form of mass of food information is a form of meta food and once you and well that's why we're information foragers and so once you grasp that and and that ideas is embedded into the story of Adam and Eve so whatever it is that they ingest is a form of meta food it's it's it's information and and you know we'll trade food for information right so if you're stuck on the edge of the highway and you know you're you're hoods up and you're you're going places thing is turned into a pile of junk that you don't understand and somebody pulls beside you pulls up beside you and they're a mechanic and they point to something to say well just put that way there you'll immediately give them a sandwich right or you would offer them something in return you know what I mean because they've provided you with information that has value and it has value because it actually provides you with energy because information provides you with energy because otherwise why would we bother with it and so food provides energy but so does information and so there's the there's the idea of food that you abstract from everything you can eat but then there's the idea of what you could abstract from all sources of food and the answer to that would be information and the trees that are being referred to in Adam and Eve are these method trees they're not ordinary trees just like paradise is no ordinary place just like Adam and Eve are no ordinary people and just like the logos that God is using at the beginning of time is no ordinary conception and and these aren't they're not metaphors there more than metaphors there I think of them as hyper realities is something like that is there more real than what you see there more real than the reality that presents itself to you and lots of things are like that right numbers are like that we wouldn't think or abstract if there weren't things that were more real than what we can see so what's most real well that's partly what we're trying to figure out and out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree that is pleasant to this sight and good for food The Tree of Life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of good and evil and a river went out of Eden to water the garden and from thence it was parted and became into foreheads that's produced a tremendous amount of speculation now you know the Garden of Eden is also the holy city that's another way of thinking about or it's Jerusalem right or it's the ideal state which could be the ideal City or it could be an ideal state of being or could be the ideal psyche here it's all of those things stacked up at the same time right and this is a Mandela and this is the Mandela form that people what would you call hypothesized that constituted the structure of paradise he knows it's got this cross form that's Eden itself and there's the the center of Eden and there's the rivers those are rivers not snakes those are the rivers that go out of it and they're turned into these Mandela images that are representative of what Jung described as the self which would be the center element of being that he associated of conscious being that he associated with divinity I would say but also with the idea of the holy city and so I'm just showing you that to show you what we're the imagination has taken ideas of paradise so the name of the first river is Kaizen that is which compasses the whole land of havilah weather is gold and the gold of that land is good there's bdellium and the onyx stone and the name of the second river is gijón the same is it that compasseth the whole land of ethiopia and the name of the third river is headache L or Hideko I don't know that is it which goes towards the east of Assyria and the fourth River is the Euphrates so there's this strange intermingling there of geography with mythical geography right which you see happen fairly frequently in the books and the Lord God took the man and put him in the Garden of Eden to dress it and keep it okay so that's that's a good that's a good command that's what you're supposed to do is take care of the damn thing it was a lot of work to make right took a whole week and the Lord God commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die well there's a sponge of questions there that people have been puzzling they're puzzling over for a long time gaudy he's tricky character in the story of Adam and Eve it's like okay if we can't eat the damn thing well why put in the garden to begin with that would be one question and you made us and then you told us not to eat this knowing perfectly well that the first thing we were going to do is eat it because people are of exactly that type which is that if you say to them with their insatiable curiosity this is all fine and nice but over here is something you should never look at and then you leave the room it's like everybody is over there trying to figure out what the hell that thing is instantly right because we're curious curious curious curious creatures and so you have to wonder exactly what God was up to here and there's Gnostic speculation that the original God this one was not really a very good God he was kind of an unconscious evil God and that he wanted his creation to be unconscious and so forbade them from developing consciousness and that it was a higher God who and maybe in the form of the serpent who tempted human beings towards consciousness and you know that that idea got scrubbed out of classic Christianity pretty early although there's something that's interesting about it and remnants of it in different forms that stayed inside the story like the idea that the fall was you know a terrible tragedy but on the other hand it was the precondition for the greatest event in history which was the birth of Christ and the redemption of mankind and so it's complicated let's put it that way god only knows what God was up to you but you know this is a good example of that ambivalence and to me again that it's an indication of the sophistication of the people who put these stories together I also consider this somewhat miraculous because you know if you're just a simple propagandist of sorts you wouldn't leave this sort of complexity in the text you just get rid of that because if you're a propagandist everything is supposed to make sense along the ideological plane and here God is supposed to be good it's like well we better get there to that line because something's up with it and it isn't obvious what it is but that isn't what people did and to me that indicates that that they were doing two things as they were trying not to be too careless with the traditions that they were handed they they were they were touching them at their peril they were very careful with them and also that they were actually trying to understand what was going on because why otherwise keep this why not just simplify it or maybe just to tribute this to the devil that would be easier and having God do it but and the Lord God said it is not good that man should be alone I will make help need for him and out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field at every fall of the air and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them and whatsoever Adam called every living creature that was the name thereof and Adam gave names to all the cattle in the fall of cattle means animals basically and to the fall of the air and every beast of the field but for Adam there was not found to help meet for him okay well a couple of things there speculations number one it's like why does God care what Adam calls the animals and the answer to that seems to be that it's associated again with the magic of speech right so that we know according to this story that human beings were already made in the image of God and that God used language in order to call order forth from chaos and that human beings were made in that image and so there's an echo of that here even though it's from an independent tradition the echo is the thing isn't quite real till you name it and and that's that's an interesting thing and we don't exactly know how far that extends it's certainly the case that like seem things often exist in a strange potential form interconnected form where everything's confusing like a massive confusion before you put your finger on it name it what's going on here you name it it's like it it carves it out from all that underlying chaos and makes it into Agrippa belen today that you can then contend with and you might say well it was real before you named it it's like well yes it was real before you named it the same way things are there when there's no one there to perceive them and it isn't obvious how things are there when you're not there to perceive them I'll tell you something bloody weird about perception you can look this up and John Wheeler John Leader's a physicist so here's a really cool thing let's say you go outside at night and you look up and you see a star and like so a photon from That star enters your eye then maybe that photon has been cruising along for like 30 million years do you know that that photon would not have been emitted from that star at that time if your eye wasn't there at that time to receive it you think well how in the hell can that because it happened 20 million years ago it's like well I don't know how it can be to tell you the truth but I know that John Wheeler has done a very good job of detailing out why that's true and necessarily true and so a wheeler is also the physicist who developed the notion of it from bit and he believes that the world is best construed as a the potential of the world is best construed as a place of information it's something like latent information and that what consciousness does is transform the latent Internet in information into something like concrete reality he doesn't mean that metaphorically and one of the cases that he makes in that regard is this story that I just told you is that the photon couldn't have left from where it was unless it had a place to go now it's it's complicated and confusing because from the perspective of a beam of light from a photon there is no time and there's no distance from one point to another well of course that's completely impossible to understand too but from the perspective of a photon the universe is completely flat perpendicular to the direction that the photon is traveling so it's there and here at the same time for us it's not it's like 20 million years ago but for the photon it's it's all here and now so anyways the reason I'm telling you all that is because the relationship between consciousness and reality is by no means straightforward it is seriously not straightforward and physicists physicists debate what the relationship is between consciousness and reality and they debate about what the sort of phenomena that I just described mean and I'm not really qualified to enter into that debate because I'm not a physicist but I do know and I've read it fair a bit of wheeler as about as much of it as I can understand and I do at least know that that's what he claimed and I also know that that claim is it is not that's a claim that's taken seriously among physicists of the caliber of the physicists who can understand wheeler so that's pretty interesting so anyways there is emphasis again on this importance of naming in order to make things real you know and sometimes people won't name things just so they don't become real so you know if you're if you have a relationship which undoubtedly you do and it has problems which undoubtedly it does you bloody well know that lots of times there's something under the carpet that no one wants to name and everybody's thinking well as long as we don't name it it's not really there and in some sense it really isn't there because you can act as if it's not there and get away with it at least for short periods of time as soon as you name that thing it's like you give it form and it's there and no one can ignore it and that's annoying because then you have to deal with it or Noor or face the consequences but the reason I'm telling you that is because we have a an intuition even that we can have things not exist by not naming them you name it and it comes forward with staggering clarity and it's not as if naming it is the only thing that gives it reality but it is something like it sharpens it and brings it into focus and gives it borders and barriers and borders and boundaries and so anyways guards interested enough and what Adam has to say that he has him named all the animals and that sort of makes them into animals no there's more to the Linguistics story than that so social psychologists Roger Brown was one of them studied this really interesting phenomena which is associated with the relationship between perception and action you know how a kid will call a particular animal a cat well the word path is very short like the word dog and it turns out that you know you could think that we could perceive cats as multicellular organisms like we could see the self we could see the molecules we could see the atoms we could see or we could see the ecosystem that the cat is part of but we don't or maybe the broader mammalian classification that it's part of we could perceive that as the unit of perception but we don't we perceive things at the level of cat and you can tell the perceptual level that people naturally perceive that which doesn't seem to be socio-culturally determined to any great degree by the way because the words are often short and easily remembered and early learned and so there's this level of analysis out of all the possible levels of analysis that the world does exist at we perceive it at a certain level of analysis and that level of analysis seems to have something to do with the world's functional utility for us at that level and the perception at that level and the naming at that level gives things a reality at that level you know because the thing about things is that they're not easily separable from other things they tangled together in all sorts of strange ways and yet when we cast our eye and and and use our language to orient ourselves in the world we cut things up into discrete discriminable objects that we can then utilize and there's something about that that makes them real in a way that they're interconnected potential the interconnected potential that they were before that that it's not it's not real in the same way at least I think it's even less real I think that's a right way of thinking about it even though it's not completely unreal but it's an echo atoms a little God at that point a little God the farther and God's already done the groundwork but Adam has to come along and says say well that's a cat it's like poof whatever that is is now a cat and that's a dog and that's a sheep and you know it gives them it gives them something like pragmatic form but for Adam there was not found to help meet for him and the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he and God took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh instead thereof and the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made he a woman and brought her unto the man and Adam said this is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh that's a walloping statement to put in there at the end of those three sentences I mean therefore comes as somewhat of a surprise but there's an injunction there well it's a good injunction man you know tell you people who don't do that they have a hell of a time in their marriage and so this is a good thing to know if you are married or if you're planning to get married is like you know we have very strong orientation towards our parents and for good reason it's like the injunction here is that secondary as soon as you're married and failure to do that makes your marriage collapse and then you deserve it to collapse - as far as I'm concerned because it's a reflection of your pathological immaturity and your unwillingness to extract yourself from the you know telling like grip of parents who are a little bit too much on the interfering side but the injunction there's there's a deep injunction here it's very complicated so one of the ideas is that the original Adam wasn't a man like like a separate man it was more like a hermaphroditic being and in that him Alfred etic being there was a kind of undifferentiated perfection and then that was split into male and female and then that part of the goal of human beings is to reunite that as the singular unity that reestablishes the initial perfection and that's actually the goal of marriage from a spiritual perspective and you could read about that if you read young because he wrote quite a bit about that so lovely it's such a good idea so I had these friends that went to Sweden to get married they were northern they were from northern Alberta but his heritage their both their Heritage's were sweet Swedish and in this ceremony they did this cool thing yes they they were being married and they had to hold a candle up between them right while they were being married and you think well okay what's the candle what's the source of light it's a source of illumination right it's a source of enlightenment it's the candle that you put on Christmas trees in in Europe so it's the light that emerges in the darkness in the depth of winter it's a symbol of life in in darkness it's the reemergence of the Sun that the at the darkest coldest time of the year which is also associated symbolically with the REIT with the birth of Christ for all sorts of complicated reasons and so the candles all that and then the next question is why do you hold it above you and the answer is because what's above you is what you're below - so it's single simplify something transcendent and so why do you both hold on to it well cuz you're both supposed to hold on to the light right and you're supposed to be subordinate to the light and so you ask well who's in charge in a marriage well the light that's the idea so you come together as one thing you no longer two things it isn't what's good for you and it's not what's good for your wife it's what's good for the marriage and the marriage is about the combined being which is the reassembly of the original Hema firma burma frenetic hermaphroditic being at the beginning of time that's the idea and that's all packed into like these four sentences and you know there's been well all of these sentences have tremendous history of interpretation associated with them right it's just endless and endless and endless and that's one of the lines and so it's also an antidote to the idea that women taken out of man which is obviously the reverse of the biological process by the way meets women in some sense subordinate to man that is not built into this text I don't see that at all is built into the text and there's something else that's associated with it too and there's an idea that you know in in in sleeping beauty you know sleeping beauty goes to sleep and the reason she goes to sleep is because you have to remember what happens is she has parents who are quite old and so they're pretty desperate to have a child like so many people are now and they only have one child like so many people do now and they don't anything it happened to this child because like hey it's a miracle and there's only one of them and so and she's the princess and so it's like we're not letting anything around her so they have a big christening party right and they invite everybody but they don't invite Maleficent and Maleficent is the terrible mother she's nature she's like the thing that goes bump in the night she's the devil herself so to speak she's everything that you don't want your child to encounter so the king and queen saying well we just want to invite her to the Krishna it's like good luck with that that's an eatable story right the eatable mother is the mother who devours her child by refusing by over protecting him or her so that instead of being strengthened by an encounter with the terrible world they're weakened by too much protection and then when they're let out into the world they cannot live and that's the story of Sleeping Beauty and that's what the king and queen do and they apologize to the two Maleficent when she first shows up and say well you know they have a bunch of half-witted excuses why they don't invite her we forgot it's like I don't think so you know you don't forget something like that and she kind of makes that point it's right the whole horror of life you don't forget about that when you have a child that's for sure you might wish that it would stay at bay but you do not forget about it the question is do you invite it to the party and the answer is it bloody well depends how unconscious you want your child to be and if you want your child to be unconscious well then you have the added advantage that maybe they won't leave home and so you can take advantage of them for the rest of your sad life instead of going off to find something to do for yourself well and then of course you can take revenge on them if they do have any any what would you call impetus towards courage that you sacrificed yourself thirty years ago and want to stamp out as soon as you see it developing your child that's another thing that would be quite pleasant and so that's what happens in Sleeping Beauty yeah well none of this is pleasant and nothing that happens in that story is pleasant so Sleeping Beauty she's naive as hell they put her out in the forest and have it raised by these three like goody two-shoes fairies that are also completely devoid of any real potency and power right there's no nothing Maleficent about them and then the first idiot Prince that wanders by she falls in love with so badly that she has post-traumatic stress disorder really rides off on his horse right that's what happens and then she then she goes into the castle and she's all freaked out because she met the love of her life for like five minutes for God's sake and you know that's when the spinning wheel that's the Wheel of Fate pops up and she pricks her finger right they try to get rid of all the spinning wheels they try to get rid of all the wheels of fate with her pointed end but she finds it poke pricks or fingers and finger falls down unconscious well she wants to be unconscious and no bloody wonder she was protected her whole life she's so damn naive that her first love affair just about kills her she wants to go to sleep never wake up and so that's exactly what happens and then she has to wait for the Prince to come and rescue her well you think how sexist can you get that story well seriously because that's that's the way that that would be read and in the modern world it's like she doesn't need a prince to rescue her that's why I Disney made frozen that absolutely appalling piece of rubbish so you know you can say you can say well the princess doesn't need a prince to rescue her but you know that's a boneheaded way of looking at the story because the prince isn't just a man who's coming to rescue the woman and believe me he's got his own problems right he's got a whole goddamn dragon he has to contend with but but the prince also represents the woman's own consciousness the consciousness is presented very frequently in stories as symbolically masculine as it is with the logos idea and the idea is that without without that forward going courageous consciousness a woman herself will drift into unconsciousness and terror and so you can read it as well the woman who's sleeping needs a man to wake her up and of course just like a man needs a woman to wake him up it's the same damn thing that's the dragon fight in Sleeping Beauty but it's also the case that if she's only unconscious all she can do is lay there and sleep like the sleep of the naive and Damned she has to wake and wake herself up and and and bring her own consciousness her own masculine consciousness into the forefront so that she can survive in the world and of course women are trying to do that like mad but that's partly what's represented in the story like that and that's partly what's implicit in this idea is that unless the woman is taken out of man so to speak then she isn't a human being she's just a creature and that's partly what's embedded in this story so you don't want to read it as a patriarchal you don't want to read anything that way so really it's it really it's yeah I won't bother with that but really we can do better than that man therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cleave unto his wife and they shall be one flesh it's like yeah thing another thing about marriage this is really worth knowing too is that I read this in part from reading young it's like what do you do when you get married that's easy see you take someone who's just as useless and horrible as you are and then you shackle yourself to them and then you say we're not running away no matter what happens yeah well that that's perfect because then you don't get to run away and the thing is is like if you can run away you can't tell each other the truth because if you tell someone the truth about you and they don't run away they weren't listening and so if you don't have someone around they can't run away then you can't tell them the truth and so that's part of the purpose of the marriage it's like okay okay I'll bet on you you bet on me it's a losing bet we both know that but given our current circumstances were unlikely to find anyone better that's for sure you know there's two things that come off of that one is you know people are waiting around to find mr."

    "text": "right at all right it's like the old Nietzsche and joke if someone loves you that should immediately disenchant you with them right right or it's the Woody Allen joke I never belonged to a club that would take me as a member so so that said that's an interesting that's a very interesting thing to think about and so you're going to shackle yourself to someone who's just as imperfect as you are and then the issue is you you you might be in a situation where you can actually negotiate because you might think well there's some things about you that aren't going so right and there's some things about me that aren't going so right and we're bloody well stuck with the consequences for the next 50 years so we could we can either straighten this out or we can suffer through it for the next five decades and you know people are of the sort that without that degree of seriousness those problems will not be solved you'll leave things unnamed because there's always an out it's like and it's the same thing when you're living together with someone you know that people who live together before they're married are more likely to get divorced not less likely and the reason for that is what exactly are you saying to one another when you live with each other just think about it well for now you're better than anything else I can trick but I'd like to reserve the right to trade you in conveniently if someone bitter happens to stumble into me well how could how could someone not be insulted to their core by an offer like that now they're willing to play along with it because they're gonna do the same thing with you now well that's exactly and it's like yeah yeah I know you're not gonna commit to me so that means you don't value me or our relationship above everything else but as long as I get to escape if I need to then I'm willing to put up with that it's like that's a hell of a thing I mean you might think how stupid is it to shackle yourself to someone it's like it's stupid man there's no doubt about that but compared to the alternatives it's pretty damn good because without that shackling there are things you will never ever learn because you'll avoid them you can always leave and if you can leave then you don't have to tell each other the truth it's as simple as that because you can just leave and then you don't have anyone you can tell the truth to so there's some representations of the idea of the original it's not this isn't all Adam this is this is an old Chinese symbol I think it's Fuxi and new although I think I have the pronunciation wrong but it's really cool see it's see the snakes down here they're kind of like DNA symbol which I find very interesting and so that's the original cosmic serpent that's there to the potential out of which that emerges and then that's the differentiation of that into male and female and so that's like the predatory unknown that's one way of thinking about it that's the most fundamental conception of mankind is something like that is the predatory unknown and then the bifurcation of that into the two fundamental cognitive elements of human perception masculine and female and you see the same thing here this is Chinese this is Egyptian also extraordinarily old it's the it's the great serpent that underlies everything forgetting itself into Isis queen of the underworld and Osiris king of the king of king of King Pharaoh king of order you see the same thing in the old alchemical symbol I love this one does it looks quite a lot like the little thing that Harry Potter chases around eh yeah and that's not accidental by the way because the seeker is the same the thing that chases this and the seeker that chases this and catches it wins and that's a really old idea and how they held JK Rowling knew that I cannot figure out because that is a very very archaic symbol arcane symbol on Google it's called the rau to chaos and the only reference to the round chaos that I can find on Google is on my web page and so I have no idea how Rowling came up with that I mean I know she looked at a lot of old texts but the idea that if you play the meta game and you catch this you win all the games is exactly right and that and that's the motif for what's the name of that Quidditch yeah so there's the potential that's like the potential out of which God made the world at the beginning of time and what emerges out of that is some kind of that's the dragon you know that in the dragon fight that's partly the serpent that's in the Garden of Eden and then that's the manifestation of masculine and feminine out of that potential predatory unknown masculine and feminine it's like a single it's like a single representation of the evolutionary history of human cognitive consciousness so cool and that's also an image of the ideal it's the union of Sun and Moon and it's this hyper creature hermaphroditic that's also the Adam and Eve that existed at the beginning of time before the fall and it's the purpose of marriage all of that as a sacrament all of that in these images it's just absolutely unbelievable what images can pack into them and there's some more classical representations of Eve being extracted from Adam and this is a cool line and they were both naked the man and his wife and we're not ashamed well that see someone who wrote that would only write that like that if they were surprised that they weren't ashamed because why would you point it out otherwise and so there's this intimation that of two things number one is there was a point at time in time when human beings were naked and they weren't ashamed of it and there is a point of time which is now where they're naked and they are ashamed of it and then the question is well what's the association with nakedness and shame and that's often given a sexual connotation in in classic interpretations of the Adam and Eve story because of its association with nudity I presume but I think it's a lot more complicated than that so you think I know I would notice my daughter she probably won't be very happy that I'm revealing this in this lecture but my daughter was never really concerned about nudity when she was a little kid is all the same to her one way or another but my son by the time he was three man that kid was private he his his bedroom door was shut the bathroom door was shut it was like get the hell out of here and that seemed to just happen of its own accord and you know we had two children and one was like that and the other one wasn't I didn't think we had much to do with it at all but it was really fascinating to watch that emerge in him and you know that that sense of of self-consciousness does seem to emerge in children somewhere around the age of three and you know that's generally also when we start thinking that maybe having your baby wander around naked on a beach isn't exactly the best idea there's there's there's something like that it's the nudity and children is generally okay under some circumstances in public display we seem to think of that as merely as acceptable why I don't know why it stops being acceptable well that has something to do with sexuality obviously but it's a very complicated phenomena but you know that whole nudity thing is then is a very complicated thing I mean first of all people are kind of strange because we're hairless roughly you know compared to most animals and we don't know why that is some people think it's because we lost our heroine we were wandering around in the day in the desert running around in Africa because we're really really good runners we can run down animals say like a human being in good shape can run a horse to death in a week we can really run man and a lot of our ancestors the Kalahari Bushmen still do this they just run an animal for like it until it dies and that Bushman doesn't die I mean they also sometimes shoot them with poison arrows but they can just run them till they die so we have tremendous endurance and you and you have to be able to get rid of a lot of heat if you're gonna run around in the desert so we don't have much hair that's one explanation and Buckminster Fuller had an interesting explanation which was he thinks that at some point during our evolution we spend a lot of time near the water and so we're like fish Apes something like that well you know we like to be on the beach and there's lots of food there and we like to swim and we're really good at swimming for terrestrial creatures and we cry salt tears like some seagoing creatures - and women have a layer of subcutaneous fat like some seagoing creatures - and we have kind of our feet are which are very odd things are kind of good for flapping in the water although we can also walk with them and so he thought that maybe that adaptation was to - water exists like seals and so forth like we kind of went back to the ocean but not quite and so but anyways the evolution of that hairlessness is an interesting thing but it certainly does make us exposed to the world in a way that animals that have a covering of fur aren't and then we're upright which is very strange because most animals aren't there on all fours and so they're very vulnerable parts are protected and not exposed to view and then of course when you're standing up nude your your your visit let's call it your psychophysiological quality is on painful display right and people complain about that all the time you know if you look at the feminist tack for example on beauty the idea that women have eating disorders is directly attributed to the presence of too many beautiful women on the cover of magazines something like that even though women buy those magazines and they're attracted to the band their mood goes up when they purchase them and if the if the stimulus was negative the women would avoid the magazines and not buy them so as a theory it's a very very bad one but it's still the case that you know it's still the case that standards of beauty shame people and that's for sure and everyone because if you're not ugly now man you're gonna be at some point in your life so that's kind of a rough thing to contend with right it's it's a rough thing to to know that that there's an ideal that you could be and maybe even once were that you're not going to be for long or knit orden or never were and it's really an appalling issue because I think it's harder on women because women are judged by men more for their but for their youth and fertility that's how it turns out from the evolutionary point of view men are judged more on their socioeconomic status by women it's harsh both ways but so anyways it's you know it's a terrible thing to to carry the knowledge with you that you're exposed to the most serious possible evaluation of the quality of your being that you can possibly be exposed to all the time and that that's further amplified if you're without clothing and so part of clothing is protection but a tremendous amount of it is merely stopping other people from evaluating you too harshly all the time it just gets in the way so and this store this this story makes the case that at some point we weren't like that well animals aren't like that so it seems perfectly plausible that at some point we weren't like that but at some point that changed and they were both naked the man and his wife and we're not ashamed how the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made and he said unto the woman yea hath God said you shall not eat of every tree of the garden I like this this is remember who did the edging who is it DeRay yeah DeRay exactly he dorade did etchings for Paradise Lost that are absolutely remarkable and this is Satan and this is the snake here and of course in in in the Genesis story Satan is weirdly associated with the snake and I'll tell you that's a that's a that's a tough one to sort out because in the story of Adam and Eve there's no indication whatsoever that the serpent who tempts Eve is also Satan the author of all evil and how in the world those two stories got tangled together well I think I figured that out and I'm gonna tell you that tonight but it took a very long time to figure it out and it's absolutely it's so bloody brilliant I just can't believe that people figured it out it's so it's so unbelievably spectacularly brilliant and that's a that's a an intimation of that idea right that there's a kinship between these two things so anyways the serpents more subtle than any beast of the field subtle is an interesting word this is from the oxford english dictionary so because will amplify the word a bit this is what you do in Union dream interpretation for example is to kind of look at the connotations of the concepts that are associated with the dream subtle of a person or animal and action behavior crafty cunning sly treacherous so it's something that sort of sneaks along right it's not something that you really pick up on that easily of a look or glance sly furtive surreptitious of a person skillful expert clever of a work of art mechanical device cleverly made or designed ingenious well that's I think that's all fairly all those terms so far are fairly well attributed to snakes I mean they are very cool things and and they are very well designed and they're quite remarkable and they're also very subtle on the nature of or involving careful discrimination of fine points or fine points difficult to understand and abstruse of a person the mind or intellectual activity intellectual activity characterized by wisdom or perceptiveness discriminating discerning and truth that's interesting because Milton's Satan is also the intellect and you know you see that very often you know it's so often the bad guys an evil scientist right and there's something about and you see the same thing in the Lion King with scar I mean scar is an intellect and arrogant deceitful intellect he's there's nothing stupid about scar he's not wise but he's the he's the evil voice that's always whispering in the Kings ear and that's associated with the pride of the intellect and the Catholics had warned people warned humanity about the pride of the intellect for centuries that's partly what produced somewhat of this Gizem between Catholicism and science although that's much overstated if you look at the historical record the idea was that the intellect has its own particular it's a remarkable faculty let's say it's the highest angel in God's heavenly kingdom that's the way that Milton portrayed it but it's also the thing that can go most terribly wrong because intellect the intellect can become arrogant about its own existence and accomplishments and it can fall in love with its own products and that's what happens when your ideological II possessed because you end up with a Dogma like say a human constructed Dogma in Solzhenitsyn's words that possesses you completely of which you believe is 100% right right so it eradicate the necessity for anything transcendent and so that's the subtle element of the intellect that's associated symbolically with the snake in the garden of paradise of a feeling scent sensation acute and keen involving distinctions that are finer delicate especially to such an extent as to be difficult to discern or analyze also almost imperceptible and elusive having little thickness or breadth thin fine subdial matter now historical rarefied matter barely there at all and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden office goddess said he shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest you die and the serpent said to the woman ye shall not surely die for God doth know in the day that you eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened and you shall be as God's knowing good and evil sneaky subtle it's a nice story a the first thing is the for instant the instant implication is well you can't trust God so that's pretty sneaky and the next is well he's trying to he's trying to pull a fast one on you and the next one is he's trying to do that because he's jealous and he doesn't want you to know things that he knows because that wouldn't be so good and he's lying to you anyways because you're not going to die and if you eat it contrary to what you've been informed then all that's going to happen is your eyes will be open and you'll be like God's knowing good and evil that sounds pretty damn good so you know and I I mean Eve what does she know you know it's no wonder she's susceptible to such blandishments and it's quite interesting too because Adam and Eve God tells Adam and Eve not to eat the damn fruit but they never promise not to write so they haven't promised they've just been told to and well should they be obedient well how obedient do you want your children to be you want them to be obedient enough so they don't get hurt but disobedient enough so that they go out in the world and do something courageous and they break some rules that they learn some things and so you know it's it's it's a very paradoxical story anyways the serpent ones that wins this round man and so Eve pays attention to the snake so again we have the same set of images right we have Adam and we have Eve we have this tree and we have this strange serpent that's a dragon-like form they're a sphinx like form that's associated with the tree the snakes eternally associated with the tree well the snake was eternally associated with the tree we spent god only knows how many tens of millions of years as tree dwelling primates and the primary or one of our primary predators we had three primary predators snakes birds cats and so the snake has been associated with the tree for a very very long time and the lesson the snake tells people is you bloody well better wake up or something you don't like we'll get you and who's going to be more susceptible susceptible to paying attention to the snake and that's going to be Eve and the reason for that is Eve has offspring and there's nothing tastier to a snake than a child and so Eve had every reason to be self-conscious and neurotic and women are more self-conscious and neurotic than men by quite a substantial amount and that's true cross culturally and in the emerges at puberty and part of the reason is as far as we can tell is that women are more sexually vulnerable they're also smaller so that's a problem if you're engaged in any physical alteration but most importantly I think is that why would you ever assume that a human females nervous system is adapted to her or her well-being why wouldn't you assume instead that her nervous system is adapted to the female infant dyad because if it isn't then the infant's die and so you might think well women are way more susceptible to depression and anxiety than men are that's a hell of a burden to bear and that's also true cross culturally by the way and it also kicks in at puberty and the biggest differences are in Scandinavia for those of you who think it's socio-cultural which it isn't so but there's reasons for it you know and it's also at puberty when men and men and women start to become sexually dimorphic in terms of size and men are way more powerful in their upper bodies it's incomparably more powerful and so that makes them a lot more dangerous and human human primary human defense mechanism is punching like with kangaroos for because there's some other animals that punch chimps can punch too but human beings it's a punch and most of the force and that is upper body and shoulder and so a woman's no match for a man in a fight so she has every reason to be nervous especially when you add that to that her additional sexual vulnerability and the fact that she has to take care of extraordinarily dependent infants were extremely fragile for a very long period of time and so she had every and women are more self-conscious than men the empirical literature on that is clear it's associated with trait neuroticism because self-consciousness is actually an unpleasant emotion who wants to be self-conscious if I'm self-conscious on the stage talking to you then all of a sudden I can't even talk to you all I'm doing is thinking about me and all the things that are wrong with me and I fall inside myself it's like self-consciousness although it's a great gift let's is nothing Pleasant its associated primarily with anxiety so we've had every reason to pay attention to the snake that's for sure I think I read this week that among I can't remember which tribes minute where it was unfortunately although I did put a footnote in my new book about this these were jungle dwelling tribal people five percent of the adults had been attacked by a python and a substantial number of children had been killed by them so snake predation was no joke it shaped our evolutionary past and still is no joke in many places and so we're a tuned to snakes and the thing is as lynn has bel pointed out an anthropologist we are really good at detecting the camouflage patterns of snakes especially in the lower half of our visual field and there's evidence that part of the reason that human beings have such acute vision which means that our eyes open let's say is because we were we co-evolved with snakes and we learned how to see them and then the price we paid for seeing was that our brain grew because you need a lot of brain to be able to see and the consequence of our brain growing is one day we woke up and discovered the future and the future is where all the snakes might live instead of where they live right now so there's that the same thing and the same so interesting again these images you see in this one you have the specter of death in the tree with the snake and the fruit now fruit is interesting - I already made the case that there's a tight linkage between what you eat and information right a conceptual link as well as a practical link but it's also the case that we can see colors and the question is why and the answer is because we evolved to see ripe fruit so in the story of Adam and Eve human beings are given vision by the snake and the fruit and that turns out to be correct so isn't that something and then you think what role do women play in relationship to men well first they make them self conscious let's not ever forget about that because I would say the primary role that women have in relationship to man is to make them self-conscious and men don't precisely like that there's nothing that will make a man more self-conscious than being rejected and why because why is he rejected well obviously their nature in the guise of that particular woman has said you're not so bad for a friend but there's no reason that your genetic material should propagate itself into the future right well it's not like men are exactly happy about being me but made self-conscious by women right it's a major source of continual tension between men and women and it's no wonder but it's also the case and this is something really cool and interesting to know you know we divulged dyv divulged dye whatever that's it diverged we diverged from the common ancestor between us and chimpanzees about six million years ago here's why at least in part chimpanzee females are non discriminant mater's they'll mate with any male when they go into heat which human females don't when they go into heat then any male is allowed access now the dominant males chase the subordinate males away and so the dominant males are more likely to leave offspring but it's not because of a female choice it's not the case with human beings human females engage in hypergamy and hypergamy is the ten this is also true cross culturally and it's also quite it's just as extensive in Scandinavia not quite there's a bit of attenuation but not much women mate across and up dominance hierarchies man-made across and down okay when that has to be the case cuz it obviously it has to work that way if one goes up the other has to go down the socio-economic status of a woman is almost determined almost zero of her attractiveness towards a man whereas the socio-economic status of a man is a major determinant of his attractiveness towards a woman and it isn't as wealth either because that's been tested it's his capacity to generate and be productive and to share because that beats the hell out of wealth wealth can disappear right but the capacity to be productive and share that's that's a much more important element and why not be chosen on the basis of that especially because women have to have infants and infants make the women dependent and the woman is just looking logically rationally and from an evolutionary perspective for someone who's useful enough to give a tool and a hat so women make intense demands on men and it's wonder but the thing is is that because women engaged in hypergamy at least in part we diverged quite rapidly from chimpanzees because the selection pressure that women placed on men developed the entire species now there's two things that happened as far as I could tell the men competed for competence let's say so the male hierarchy is a mechanism that pushes the best man to the top virtually by definition and then that's that's the effect of that is multiplied by the fact that women who are a Pergamus appeal from the top and so that the males who are the most competent are much more likely to leave offspring and that seemed to be what drove our cortical expansion for example which happened very very rapidly over the course of evolutionary time so and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto her husband with her and he did eat oh yes and women share food that's a very strange thing because most creatures don't do that right most animals don't share food like if you if you're a wolf and you bring down something in a hunt you eat your fill the dominant creatures eat their fill and then if there's some left over the subordinates get to eat too but that doesn't how human beings work we share food now you can imagine how that evolved because lots of female creatures share food with their offspring ok you don't need much of a twist in that from an evolutionary perspective till you start to share food not only with your offspring se but with your mate and that's another way that you entice a mate it's like we're gonna be better together then alone well that's the offering of the fruit well what's the self-conscious part well here's part of the bargain you know I'm gonna wake you up and partly I'm gonna wake you up because you need to be woken up because I have this infant that needs some damn care and so you bloody well better be awake and part of the bargain is all offer you something I'll offer you some food and in response we're gonna make a team and that's the deal well that's the human deal and that's why we're more or less monogamous by why we more or less pair bond and why something approximating marriage is a human Universal it's cross-cultural now you can find exceptions but who the hell cares the vast really man who cares the VIP you look at the vast pattern the vast pattern well in the price we pay for having large brains is that we're very dependent and it takes a long time for us to get programmed and because of that we need relatively stable family bonding and that's basically what we've evolved and you know you don't get that without making men self-conscious because male creatures why not impregnate and run I mean why the hell not and that's something to really no kidding like that's the thing to think about it is not why man abandoned their children that's the mystery it's why any men ever stick with them that's the mystery because you just have to look at the animal kingdom and like the simplest and easiest thing is always the most likely thing to occur so it's the exception that long-term commitment that needs explanation she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto her husband with her and he did eat and the eyes of both of them were opened implying that before that they were closed and they knew they were naked and they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons so that's so interesting so their eyes are open which indicates that they weren't to begin with so whatever God created to begin with was kind of blind indeed but not blind in some strange way cuz they weren't obviously wandering around in the garden bumping into trees it was some sort of metaphysical blindness that's been removed by whatever has just happened and whatever's just happened also made them realize that they were naked okay so what sort of eye opening is that well what does it mean to realize that you're naked it means to realize that you're vulnerable that's what people discovered it's like oh we can be hurt so you're a zebra in a herd of zebras and there's a bunch of lions around there laying on the grass you don't care those are laying down lions laying down lions are no problem it's standing up hunting Lions that are the problem you're not smart enough to figure out that laying down lines turn into standing up hunting lions so you're not like building a fort to keep the Lions out you're just mindlessly eating grass you're not very awake but that's not what happens to human beings is they wake up and they think we're vulnerable permanently it's never going away right it's the it's the recognition of that eternal vulnerability and what happens the first thing they do is clothe themselves well what happens when you're naked when you need protection from the world well obviously look you're all wearing clothes you know why well we've been doing that for a very very long period of time it's tens of thousands of years at minimum in fact you can track more or less when clothing developed because you can do DNA testing of the kind of lice that cling to clothes rather than hair and so we have a pretty good idea of when clothing emerged and of different types as well so that's quite cool but the point is they're naked and they think that's not so good we're vulnerable so their eyes were open enough so they become self-conscious and they recognize their own vulnerability and the first thing they do is the first step of culture is to protect themselves with something from the world and you protect yourself from the world and from the prying eyes of other people this is the book by Lynn Isabel why we see so well from the temptation of Eve to the venomous murder of the Mighty Thor the serpent appears throughout time and culture as a figure of mischief and mystery misery the worldwide prominence of snakes in religion myth and for Clure underscores our deep connection to the serpent but why when so few of us have first-hand experience mm-hmm the surprising answer this book suggests lies in the singular effect of snakes on primate evolution predation pressure from snakes Lynn Isabel tells us is ultimately responsible for the superior vision and large brains of primates and for a critical aspect of human evolution that was tested recently psychologists have known for a long time that people are can learn fear to snakes but they discovered in primates recently a set of neurons Paulding or neural neurons which are specialized that's an old old perceptual systems reveal neurobiological evidence of past selection for rapid detections of snakes so that's from 2013 so the snake definitely woke us up color vision as an adaptation to fruit eating in primates it's not by accident that women make themselves look like ripe fruit in order to be attractive to men right and that's also not socio-cultural in origin so and they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the cool of the day and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden that's interesting so what's the implication prior to being woken up prior to recognizing nakedness and vulnerability there was no reason for God for men and women to hide from God now are they hiding from God well they're naked they're vulnerable okay so think about this think about this it's like imagine that you have the capacity to live truthfully and courageously and forthrightly just imagine that and then imagine why you might not do that and then imagine well how about fear and shame how would that work well let's say that the idea of living forthrightly and truthfully and courageously is analogous given what we already know about these stories to walking with God in the garden well what stops people from doing that what stops people from hiding well it's their own rage the recognition of their own inadequacy they look at themselves and they think how in the world is a creature such as I supposed to live properly in this world with everything that's wrong with me and so what are you hide from well you you go home you sit on your bed for five minutes and ask yourself what have you hidden from in your life man you'll have books of knowledge reveal themselves to you in your imagination right say well why are you hiding well it's no bloody wonder you're hiding it's no wonder that people hide that's the thing that's so terrifying about this story we woke up and we thought oh my god look at this place like this is seriously there's some serious trouble here and we're in some serious trouble and we're not what we could be and so we hide and that's what the story says people woke up they became self-conscious they recognized their own vulnerability and that made them made them hide from manifesting their divine destiny it's like yeah that's exactly right and the Lord go there I love this part of the story and that's so funny and the Lord God called and we could use a little humor at this point and the Lord God called unto Adam and said unto Him where art thou and Adam said I heard thy voice in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked so in case there was any doubt about that that's why and I hid myself and God said who told you that you were naked did you eat of the tree where have I commanded you that you should not eat and this is where Adam shows himself in all his post-fall heroic glory and the man said the woman whom thou gave us to be with me she gave me of the tree and I did eat so that's that pert man that's such that it's so you know again there's a modern feminist interpretation of the story of Adam and Eve that makes the claim that Eve was portrayed as the universal bad guy of humanity for disobeying God and eating the Apple it's like fair enough you know looks like she slipped up and then she tempted her husband and you know that makes her even worse although he's was foolish enough to immediately eat so it just means she was a little more courageous than him then got there first but it's Adam who comes across as really one sad creature in this story as far as I'm concerned welcome buddy manages in one sentence it's like first of all it wasn't him it was the woman and second even blames God so it wasn't just the woman it was it was that woman and you gave her to me and she gave me of the tree and I did eat it's like so hey Adams all innocent except now he's not only is he naked and disobedient and cowardly and ashamed he's also snively backbiting think he rats her out like the sick and he gets the opportunity and then he blames God it's like and that's exactly right that's exactly right man you go online and you read you read the commentary that men write about women when they're resentful and bitter about women you read it it's so interesting it's like it's not me it's those [ __ ] okay that's right it's not me it's them and not only that what a bloody world this is in which they exist it's exactly the same thing it's exactly the same thing and it is absolutely pathetic all right and the Lord God said unto the woman what is this that thou has done and the woman said the serpent beguiled me and I did eat well he she has a bloody excuse first of all it's a snake I mean those things there was we already found out there's subtle and second it turns out that the damn snake is Satan himself you know and he's rather treacherous so the fact that she got tangled up in his mess let's say is well problematic but it it's a hell of a lot better excuse that Adam has and the Lord God says unto the serpent because thou has done that done this thou art cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field upon thy belly shalt thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the days of my life and snakes by the way are lizards that lost their legs just so you know and I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel I love these pictures they're so smart and again strip the religious context from them and just look at them for a second what do you see you see the eternal mother holding her infant away from the snake see it down there right crocodile snake everything predatory that's been after us for like 60 million years the reason we're here is because of that that's why it's a sacred image now this one I like even better see down there there's something like the moon and then there's this reptile down there that Eve is standing on this is really old and I showed you this before but I think it's so cool she's coming out of this thing that's like a hole in the sky you know because it indicates the eternal re presence of this figure it's something like that the eternal recurrence of this figure it's an archetype but then the the the potential out of which she is emerging these are all musical instruments back here and so what the artist is representing is the great powder complexity of being and the emergence of the protective mother from that background protecting the infant eternally against predation it's like how can that not be a holy image if it isn't a holy image if you don't think it's a holy image then there isn't something wrong with the image there's something wrong with the perceiver unto the woman he said well God's just outlining the consequences of this right now it's like okay well now you've gone and done it you've woken up this is what's going to happen I'll greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children and thy desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee doesn't say he should says he will and why in sorrow shalt thou bring forth children well when you develop a brain that big so that you can see it's not that easy to give birth anymore and then you produce something that's dependent beyond belief and that's one of the things that you would say dooms you to precisely this so that's Eve's punishment for waking up and Adam because thou has hearkened unto the voice of thy wife and has eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee saying thou shalt not eat it cursed is the ground for thy sake in sorrow shalt thou eat of it in all the days of thy life what's that it's the invention of work thorns and thistles shall it bring forth to thee and thou shalt eat the herb of the field it's the invention of work what do people do that animals don't work what does work mean means you sacrifice the present for the future and why do you do that because you know you're vulnerable because you're awake and so from here on in from this point there's no return to unconscious paradise I don't care how many problems you've solved so that today is okay you've got a lot of problems coming up and they'll bloody matter how much you work you're never going to work enough to solve them and so all you're gonna do from here on in is be terrified of the future and that's the price of waking up and that's the end of paradise and that's the beginning of history and that's how that story goes in this sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return unto the ground for out of it though taken for dust thou art and unto dust thou shalt return and Adam called his wife's name Eve because she was the mother of all living unto Adam also and unto his wife did the Lord God make coats of skin and clothed them that's William Blake by the way and the Lord God said Behold the man has become as one of us to know good and evil and now lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat and live forever I'll go over this again next week therefore the galore God sent him from the forth forth from the Garden of Eden to till the ground from whence he was taken so he drove out the man and he placed at the east of the Garden of Eden cherubims and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the Tree of Life one more thing and then we'll stop so I thought why in the world so Adam and Eve are tempted by the snake they eat the fruit they wake up they realize they're naked they realize that they're vulnerable they realize the future they realize they're gonna die they realized that they have to work it accounts for difficulty and conception and the fall of humankind from unconscious paradise okay that makes sense what about the knowledge of good and evil what in the world does that mean the Mesopotamians believed that human beings were made out of the blood of King knew who was the worst monster that time out who was the goddess of chaos could imagine and then produce so their idea was that whatever was about humanity there was something deeply deeply deeply demonically flawed so that's their conception and the some of that same milieu that these stories emerge so what is opening your eyes and realizing your vulnerability have to do with the knowledge of good and evil really I thought about that I really thought about that I got to tell you I thought about that for like 20 years because I knew there was something there that I could not put together and at the same time I was I was reading things I'm gonna tell you something truly awful and so if you need a trigger warning you're you're getting one and and believe me I do not give trigger warnings lately so I'm gonna tell you something you will never forget so this is what unit 731 used to do in China and China said Japanese unit during the first Second World War right as far as I can tell they did the most horrific things that were done to anyone during World War two and that's really something so this is what they did they took their prisoners and they would put them in a position so that their arms would freeze solid and then they would take them outside and pour hot water over their arms and then they would repeat that till the flesh came off the bones and they were doing that to investigate the treatment of frostbite for soldiers now you can look up unit 731 if you want to have nightmares so that's a unit 731 that's human-beings someone thought that up and then people did it that's knowledge of good and evil here's the here's the key man you know you're vulnerable no other animal knows that you know what hurts you because you're vulnerable now that you know what hurts you you can figure out what hurts someone else and as soon as you know what hurts someone else and you can use that you have the knowledge of good and evil well it's a pretty good trick that the snake pulled because it doesn't look like it's exactly the sort of thing that we might have wanted if we would have known what the consequence was but as soon as a human being is self conscious and aware of his own nakedness then he has the capacity for evil and that is that's introduced into the world right at that point and here's the rest of this story so there's the snake right and you're some tree dwelling primate and the snake eats you and that sucks so let's like let's watch out for the damn snakes and then you think well wait a minute your brain grows and you think wait a minute well there's not just a snake there's where snakes live why don't we just get the hell out of the tree and go hunt down the snakes and get rid of them so those are sort of like potential snakes and so the snake becomes a potential snake and it's the same circuit that you're using to do this thinking and then you get rid of the damn snakes it's like st."

    "text": "Peterson over the last couple weeks and further back you talked a lot about consciousness and the importance of it but I was hoping to get your opinion on an issue of consciousness that has often seen Christianity among other groups and politics kind of clash so I'm hoping to get your views on the consciousness or lack thereof of a human fetus and how that's impacted you views an abortion whatever they are and any thank you thank you okay so the first question is do I have an answer for that that's a good enough answer to actually reveal no I don't but I'll I can flail about a little bit around it abortion is clearly wrong I don't think anybody debates that you wouldn't recommend that someone that you love have one okay now having clarified that that mere statement doesn't eliminate the complexity of the situation the first question is is should everything wrong be illegal that's a tough question everything that's wrong isn't illegal then there's the additional complication of the difference let's say in gravity regarding the problem in relationship to men and women and we don't know how to deal with that having said that I would say that it's actually the wrong question there's a something Leonard Cohen said once he said that in a massacre there's no decent place to stand and what he meant by that was sometimes you're where there is no good decision left no matter what you do it's wrong so then the question is how did you get there well let's say you're in a position where you are inclined to seek an abortion the question is how did you get there now we have a lot to straighten out about sexual relationships between men and women in the modern world they're bent and warped and demented out of shape one of the things I see with young people for example is that they will engage in sexual acts with one another that they would not talk about with one another I mean couples will do that for that matter like married couples will do that but they're married that's that's a different story it seems to me that if you are willing to engage in a sexual act with someone with whom you would not discuss that act you probably put the cart before the horse so the discussion regarding the legality of abortion is nested inside a larger discussion about the morality of abortion and that's disconnected inside a larger discussion about the proper place of sexuality and human behavior and to me that's the level at which the problem needs to be addressed now I don't have the answer to that you know because the old answer was get married that was a good answer and it's an answer that people should still listen to but we'll put that aside momentarily I had a client at one point who was I don't know she was probably I'm not I'm gonna disguise her in a variety of different ways she was 27 2008 come from a relatively conservative background quite a timid fearful person and also not very well not sophisticated in relationship to relationships and she'd never had sex well there's a bunch of things she'd never done well the answer from me to her wasn't continue to be timid about everything because that wasn't working out for her she needed to go have some adventures now sexual adventures like other adventures are dangerous and so you have to be very careful when you encourage people to go out and have adventures but but but too much timidity and caution also constitutes a pathway to perdition let's say you can't just say to people in the modern world well you know sex till you're married unless you're gonna get married when you're very young and perhaps you should I don't know about that but I don't think that we're mature enough as a culture to have a serious discussion about sexual propriety especially in the aftermath of the birth control pill and we seriously need to do that and we have it and so I think the eternal debate about abortion horrible as it is is a it's the surface manifestation of a much deeper problem now I talked a little bit today about the utility of marriage like the spiritual utility of marriage and that's something that I think we're so immaturely cynical as a culture like we don't we're not wise enough to look at an institution like marriage and to really think about what it means and what it signifies it signifies a place that people could tie the ropes of their lives together so that they're stronger it signifies a place where people can tell the truth to one another it signifies a place where sexuality can properly be integrated into life that's no easy that's no easy task it's a place where children at least in principle can be put first and foremost as they should be once they exist and so there's a much broader discussion that has to happen I think before any concentration on the legality of abortion is liable to get anywhere at all that's what it looks like to me so that's the best I can do with that question hi dr."

    "text": "Peterson earlier you showed a picture of [ __ ] seein nua yeah right uh and and Osiris and in your maps of meaning like yes you also explained that cultures around the world have these twin snakes there yeah they're everywhere man yeah and so you mentioned that you believe this is a representation of DNA you would bring that up to Jesus what is it with you guys tonight huh yeah well yeah no I wouldn't say I believe that I have my suspicions that that might be it yeah because believe is too strong a word but those representations are everywhere and read this book this is a good one oh man now I have to remember the book it's by an anthropologist who went down to the Amazon jungle and experimented intensively with ayahuasca I think it's called the cosmic serpent I think that's the name of the book you could read that there's another one called breaking open the head which is also pretty damn interesting and there's something to those books I mean the cosmic serpent kind of goes off on a bit of a tangent I would say although breaking open the head is it's better better it seems to stay more constrained and tight but there's we don't know the limits of our perception and especially under certain conditions and I think people have had intimations of DNA as the cosmic serpent for ever so yeah but that's a like that's way out on the frontiers of my knowledge right like I'm guessing in a dreamlike way when I'm making statements like that so some some dreams and interpretations that we could have perceived as it is right well yes we did we didn't objectively but I'm not so sure we didn't subjectively but and means very strange that these that these double helixes exist in so many places and that they're often utilized as healing symbols with the snake so anyways like I said that's what do you call that I'm it's not hypothesizing it's one thing worse than that speculating those are speculations I'm I'm operating at the edge of my understanding but our perceptions can are very mutable and they can we can see things under some conditions that you wouldn't think that anybody could see so okay yep so I have a thought while you're talking about sort of getting to the end of the talk about the snake and in the Apple and so on so is what you're saying is the moment that that that Adam and Eve eat the Apple they become nervous or whatever so that's awareness of their own vulnerability so then like you said it's also awareness of their own capacity to do harm so it's like when they were eating the Apple then that's them their immediate sort of nervous reaction is is because they ate the Apple and they kind of became evil in that moment or something like that well they woke up and because they they woke up and realized how they could be hurt how they could and would be hurt over the over the over the upcoming overtime it's the same as the discovery of the discovery of your own nakedness and the discovery of time are very very similar phenomena I mean sure as soon as you know how you can be hurt well you know if you have to just consult your evil fantasies it's like what'll really hurt him oh yeah that would work it's like how do you know that well you just think about it what would happen if that happened to me that would hurt oh yeah that'll work it'll hurt him or her and you know you probably think that way twice a week or maybe twice a day Jesus every time you have an argument with someone all you have to do is look at the back of your mind a little bit you don't want to that's for sure but if you do you'll see these sorts of thought process is generating constantly it's like you know in a back-and-forth discussion particularly with people you love it's like you're always looking for a place to put the knife in so then it seems really similar to me or seems like they're kind of discovering the kind of like Union shadow within themselves so that that is the moment where it got introduced into the human spirit sure one of the things about the shadow is that it's also when you integrate that that's what makes you a substantial person right no it's like it seems to me that on one hand well it's it seems like this tragedy that Satan the most evil the father of evil whatever has introduced into people but it also seems like without that shadow that people are kind of insubstantial so yeah well duh right right I mean that like I said that there's been a multitude of interpretations emerge as a consequence of that story what was God up to was was God in fact evil the initial God like why would he create a snake why would he put it in the garden why would there be these trees what the hell is going on with the whole Satan thing you know it's very very problematic well we'll talk about it more and this again is let's call it speculation well if you want to make something strong you test it and maybe if you want to make something ultimately strong you test it ultimately and I think that there's an aspect of being that has that element is that human beings are tested ultimately it's partly because we know good and good and evil now and so that's the landscape in which we exist so you could say the landscape is across its chaos and order and it's good and evil and we're stuck in the middle between those two things it's a very common theme by the way in videogames exactly that chaos order good evil it's that it's the basic plot of endless video games and that's perhaps because it's the basic plot those are the things we have to contend with well I had a vision once I shouldn't tell you this but I will anyways I had a vision once that that I went to heaven and I was put in a in a Roman amphitheater with Satan just like Thor encountering the Hulk right that's coming up in that new Avengers movie and so it was a shark because I thought there was a hell of a thing to happen in heaven and so I had this battle and I won and at the end I came up to God and said like you know what's with the whole Roman amphitheater thing there it seemed like it over the top to me said why would you put me in a ring with some one thing like that and he said because I knew you could win and you know I don't know what to make of that one thing I should teach you should make of it as I shouldn't tell you but whatever but you know there's something there's something to that in my estimation it's like do you protect the people you love or do you try to make them strong so you think it's that it's not that we have like Satan to thank for making us substantial it's that God gave us Satan in order to make us substantial well I'd hesitate to say that because you know it's it's so cut and dried but I would say that there's a that's a strong underlying theme in the biblical narrative yes now it's certainly not the only scene it's not the only interpretation by any stretch of the imagination but there is something there and there's something there you know at the end we didn't talk about this God puts up this flaming sword and these cherubim to keep you away from the tree of life it's like it's seem if paradise and immortality are the promised land and what's with the whole flaming angel and sword thing we could have just had the damn fruit five thousand years ago and not bothered with the problem well it seems to me that there's something like I don't know what it is consciousness through tragedy clarity through suffering maybe something like that or maybe the perfection that lurks as a potential in the future is something that has to be earned rather than given maybe it has no value without free choice maybe we have to distinguish between good and evil now that we have the capacity to actually apprehend them maybe that's what life is about maybe that's the separating of the wheat from the chaff see that's the idea in Revelation right because when Christ comes back in the book of Revelation he divides the Damned from the saved and the same the people who lived in logos roughly speaking and and the Damned or those who don't and so there's this idea that there's this dynamic that underlies experience that is in fact that's sorting now I don't know what to make of that at all but that's the story but what I can make of that is that I I can't put a lever underneath the argument that I just made tonight about the relationship between the development of vision the snake the fruit nakedness time the future work and most importantly the emergence of evil that seems to me to be I cannot find a way to undermine that argument it seems I can't break it and that's what I'm always looking for when I'm trying to formulate ideas I'm trying to look for something that no matter how hard I try I cannot break and I can't break that set of ideas now what the full implication is of that set of ideas god only knows right but but I could say also practically you know one of the things that I've observed is that lies and deception destroy people's lives and when they start telling the truth and acting it out things get a lot better gotta stop [Applause] you"

What are your thoughts on that? Oh?"

Hmm, I don't know if I can answer that [question] that way the the part of the attraction of Christianity, but this was something that emerged across time was the notion that even if you were in a lowly position that there was something About you that was akin to the divine and now you might say well, that's just wish fulfillment That's what freud would say that's what Marx would say right the opiate of the masses Tweeted yesterday something."

    "text": "[Music] three difficult stories tonight and hopefully my plan is to get through all three of them so we'll see how that goes so we're going to talk about the story of sodom and gomorrah and then the story of the sacrifice of Isaac which is an extremely complicated complicated story and so we'll try to make some headway with that the story of Sodom and Gomorrah is plenty complicated - all right so what we established last week at least in part was this idea that the Abrahamic narratives are set up as punctuated epochs I suppose in Abraham's life and we were hypothesizing that you know you set out a goal for yourself in your life it's like a stage in your life you might say that and then when you run that goal to its end when that stage comes to an end then you have to regroup and orient yourself once again and I was making the case that that's a good time to make necessary sacrifices you know and part of that because as you move through your life you have to shed that which is no longer necessary and because otherwise it accretes around you and holds you down and you perish sooner than you should and I think that's in large part because if you don't dispense with your life as you move through it then the stress of all that undone business and all those unmade decisions turns into a kind of chaos around you and that chaos puts you in a state of psychophysiological emergency preparedness chronically and that just ages you and so it's necessary in some sense to stay light on your feet and also I think to renew your commitment to your aim upward and I believe that that's what the sacrificial routines in the Abrahamic stories dramatized I said already that these things are often first portrayed very dramatically and concretely before they become psychologists and we'll see because one of the things that happens tonight as well in these stories is that when God makes his covenant with Abraham this is the next part of the story it's also when the idea of circumcision is introduced into ancient Hebrew culture and others every bit of evidence that other cultures were utilizing circumcision beforehand so it wasn't necessarily a novel invention of the Abrahamic people but I see its introduction as a step on the road to the psychologize ation of the idea of sacrifice right first of all it's giving up something concrete and then second it's signified by the sacrifice of a part of the body instead of for the sake of the whole it's something like that it's dramatizing the idea that you have to give up a part of yourself for the sake of the whole and eventually well by modern times that becomes virtually completely psycho psychological and it's in its essence in that we all understand perhaps not as well as we should but at least well enough to explain it that it's necessary to make sacrifices to move ahead in life one of the themes that I'd like to explore tonight in relationship especially to the sacrifice of Isaac is that you know once humanity had established the idea that sacrifice was necessary to move ahead which is really it's a discovery of incalculable magnitude right the idea that the idea that you can give up something in the present and that will in some sense ensure a better future is an unbelievable achievement it's equivalent to the discovery of the future it's equivalent to the discovery of the utility of work like its importance can't be overstated okay so it took a long time for people figure this out animals haven't figured it out at all right we've figured it out and it's hard it's hard for people to make sacrifices because of course the present has a major grip on you as it should because in some way you live in the present so anyways there's the twin problem of getting the whole idea of sacrifice up and running and then figuring out exactly what it means but there's a problem that branches off that too or a two-fold problem so the hypothesis is that sacrifice is necessary to ensure the that the future is safe and secure and productive and positive and all of those things ok so then then a question immediate two questions immediately rise from that right one is well what's the proper sacrifice now we already talked about that a little bit with regards to Cain and Abel and one of the things we saw was that Cain's sacrifice whatever it was was wrong and Abel's was right Noah's seemed to be right Abraham seems to be right there is something about a sacrifice that can be correct there's something about a sacrifice that can be incorrect the question is what would be the maximally correct sacrifice so because that's an obvious question to arise from the mere observation that sacrifice is necessary okay if you're going to sacrifice and it's necessary well how is it that you would behave if you were going to do it really well if you're going to do it perfectly okay so that's question number one and then question number two might be well if the future can be better because of the sacrifice and sacrifices can vary in quality then how much better could this set the future be if your sacrifice was of the highest quality right there's a limit issue there and it the limit is something like well how good could your life be if you really got your act together and you gave up all the things that we're impeding you in your movement forward if you did that forthrightly and and and with with integrity and with seriousness with with dead seriousness and you tried to set your life right what is the upper limits with regards to how your life might lay itself out and I would say well we don't know the answer to that but I think that like the idea of something like the City of God or the kingdom of God on earth or the re-establishment of paradise something like that is the answer of the imagination to the court how good could the future be if sacrifice was optimized and those are archetypal questions right an archetypal question is a question that everyone asks whether they know it or not because sometimes you can act out a question an archetypical estin is a question that everyone asks and an archetypal answer is the answer that can't be made any better to that question so I can give you an example of that the reason that Christ's passion is an archetypal story is because it's a kind of limit right it's the worst possible set of things that can happen to the best possible person so it's a story that constitutes a limit it has nothing to do with the factual reality of the story that's a completely independent issue I'm speaking about this psychologically is that certain stories can exhaust themselves in a perfect form and that would be the archetypal form so that's the territory that we're going to wander around in a little bit today and we'll use the stories as anchors in thinking a lot about the Sodom and Gomorrah story because it has its classically associated with a biblical injunction against homosexuality and that's often how it's read I would say in particular by the more fundamentalist end of the Christian spectrum and I've thought about that a lot because it's pretty damn clear that the story of Sodom and Gomorrah has something to do with sexual and propriety but I've really come to the conclusion and it's very little to do with homosexuality so we'll see how that interpretation prevails as we walk through this tonight okay so we'll start with a bit of a recap from last week so Abraham's had had his last adventure and he's 90 years old ninety nine years old actually the Lord appeared to Abram and said unto him I am the Almighty God walk before me and be thou perfect well that's quite the command now Alexander McLaren who we talked about before it elaborated upon this slightly and this is what he had to say it's this is not precisely walking with God the idea of walking before God it is rather that of an act of life spent in continual consciousness of being naked and opened before the eyes of him to whom we have to give an account okay so that's that's an idea that's in keeping with the notion that what we're seeing an Abrahamic story is the call to adventure of the of man of the typical person right because your life in some sense is an adventure and I suppose the reason for that is that you're confronted by things that you cannot understand that you have not yet mastered there's a heavy price to be paid if you fail to conduct yourself appropriately and there's a large reward to be gained if you conduct yourself properly and so that pretty much defines an adventure story and God calls to Abraham and tells him to move out into the world to leave what he's familiar with to go into the strange lands of famine and tyranny and to find his place and that works out quite nicely for Abraham and so what that also means is that because Abraham is doing that consciously at least according to this interpretation that he's not naive in his in his determination to move forward you know I mean I've dealt with lots of people who have anxiety disorders you know and one thing about people who have anxiety disorders is they are not mysterious to me I understand it's no problem for me to understand why people have anxiety disorders or why they're depressed or why they have substance use problems the mystery to me is always why people don't have all of those things at once because everybody has a reason to be anxious in fact we have the ultimate reason to be anxious because we know that we're vulnerable and we know that we're going to die and how you cannot be anxious under those circumstances is a great mystery it's a massive mystery and the same thing applies with regards to depression and then the same thing applies to some degree with regards to drug and alcohol abuse because I said last week there's plenty of reasons to drown your consciousness in alcohol that's for sure we could refer to the aforementioned anxiety depression not least and so and the and the sorts of drugs that people are prone to take our chemicals that take the affective edge off the tragedy of life so so back to back to the issue of fear being Abraham is self-conscious that's what this commentary says but the thing is as he moves forward despite that he's self-conscious and he knows the danger but he moves forward despite that and that's actually the appropriate response in the face of actual non naive understanding of what constitutes life like if you're naive and you move forward it's like well what the hell do you know you know there's no courage in naivety because you don't know what there is to stop you you don't know what dangers you might apprehend but to be aware of what it is that your problem is so to be alert existentially let's say or to be fully self conscious means that you're perfectly aware of your limitations and how you might be hurt and then to make the decision to move forward into the unknown and the land of the stranger anyways that's the I would say that's one of the secrets to a good life and I can say that really without fear of contradiction I would I would say because the clinical literature on this is very very very clear what you do with people who are afraid and to some degree depressed but certainly anxious is you lay out what what they're anxious about first of all in in detail what is it that you're afraid of what might happen and then you decompose it into small problems hypothetically manageable problems and then you have the person expose themselves to this thing that they're afraid of and what happens isn't that they get less afraid that isn't what the clinical literature indicates exactly what happens instead is they get braver and that's not the same thing right cuz if you get less afraid it's like well the world isn't just dangerous as I thought it was you know silly me if you get braver that's not what happens what happens is the other world am world's just as dangerous as I thought or maybe it's even more dangerous than I thought but it turns out that there's something in me that responds to taking that on as a voluntary challenge and grows and thrives as a consequence and there's no doubt about this even the psychophysiological findings are quite clear if you if you can if you impose a stressor on two groups of people and on one group the stressor is imposed involuntarily and on the other group the stressor is picked up voluntarily the people who pick up the stress or voluntary voluntarily use a whole different psychophysiological system to deal with it they use the system that's associated with approach and challenge and not the system that's associated with defensive aggression and withdrawal and the system that is associated with challenges much more associated with positive and much less associated with negative emotion it's also much less hard on you because the the defensive posturing system the prey animal system man when that thing kicks in it's all systems are go for you you know you're the gas is pushed down to the are the pedals pushed down to the metal and the brakes are on you're using future resources that you could be storing for future time right now in the present to ready yourself for emergency so there's there's there's nothing simple or trivial at all about the idea of being called to move forthrightly forward into the strange and the unknown and there's a real adventure that's associated with that right so that's an exciting thing which is part of the reason why people travel and then also to see yourself as the sort of creature that can do that is willing to do that on a habitual basis is also the right kind of tonic for I hate this word for your self-esteem you know because the self-esteem has nothing to do with feeling good about yourself as I already mentioned there isn't necessarily reason why a priori you should just feel good about yourself but if you can view yourself acting in a courageous and forthright manner and encountering the world and trying to improve your lot and and and taking risks you know in a non naive way well then you have something that you can comfort yourself with at night when you're wondering what the whole damn point of is of your futile and miserable life and so and that's necessary because it's often the case that you wake up at 4:00 in the morning or at least sometimes the case that you wake up at 4:00 in the morning when things haven't been going that well and wonder just what the hell the point is of your futile and miserable life you have to have something real to set against that it can't be just rationalizations about how you know you're a valuable person among others even though that's true that's not good enough you need something that's more realistic to set it against that an observing courage in yourself is definitely one of the things that that that can help you sleep soundly at night when when things are destabilized a little bit around you so back to the covenant God tells Abraham me make my covenant between me and D and will multiply the exceedingly and Abram fell on his face and God talked with him saying as me behold my covenant my contract is with thee and thou shalt be a father of many nations neither shall thy name anymore be called Abram but thy name shall be called Abraham for a father of many nations have I made thee an abram means High father and Abraham father of a multitude and I'll make thee exceedingly fruitful and I will make nations of thee and Kings shall come out of thee and I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant to be a God unto thee and to thy seed after thee and I will give unto thee and thy seed after thee the land wherein thou art a stranger all the land of canaan for an everlasting possession and I will be their God I love that line really the line about the land where you are a stranger you know and everything that happens in the Bible almost everything that happens in these more archaic stories in particular is laid out geographically the metaphor is Geographic so you move to a land that you haven't yet occupied maybe that's full of strangers and then the land is what's granted to you but it's perfectly reasonable to think about this from the perspective from a more abstract perspective it's much more relevant to modern people with our incredibly complex societies you know it's definitely the case that if you go into the land of the stranger which is exactly what you do when you try out any new endeavor right when you start a new job or when you start a new educational enterprise or when you start a new relationship doesn't matter you're out there in unexplored territory like the physical geography is the same but we don't live in in the physics in the spatial world only we live in the temporal spatial world and what that means is that the same place can be different at a different time and maybe it can be completely different and so if you're in your house but you have a new person in your house while your house is new for all intents and purpose because the territory surrounding that new person is the territory of the foreigner essentially and the same thing happens to you when you start a new job and you'll find that when you start a new job especially if you stretched yourself a little bit beyond your zone of comfort that you very much feel like an imposter right when you're first there and then the question is well how do you master that and the answer to that seems to be well it seems fairly straightforward if the place that you're in has any degree of possibility if it isn't inhabited by demons so to speak the best way to act is to lift your aim upward an attempt to get your act together and to tell the truth and to live a meaningful life and to do difficult things all of that and that is the best way of mastering a new territory and you know I all probability the degree to which you're able to act that out is precisely proportionate to the degree to which you're going to become a master in that territory and not sort of thinking having a lot faster than people think you know it's it's really quite remarkable how fast you can move forward if you can establish yourself somewhere and prove yourself useful assuming that you're around people to whom proving yourself useful actually matters like I know perfectly well that you can end up in an employment situation where you're punished for your virtues right in which case you should just get the hell out of there and really really you get out of there and you go find somewhere where if you work hard and do what you're supposed to do you're actually going to be rewarded right because that's not a workplace that's hell and you should just leave there so and God said unto Abraham thou shalt keep my covenant therefore thou and thy seed after thee in their generations this is my covenant which he shall keep between me and you and thy seed after thee every man child among you shall be circumcised that's a mystery they're like why that particular right what's dramatic I mean it certainly it certainly affects a man where he's most concerned to be affected there's something like that and so it's it's a sacrifice that has a certain I would say a certain degree of unforgettable 'ti that would be the first thing and a certain degree of pain and threat that goes along with it so it's not nothing that's the thing now you can argue and I think there is an argument a case to be made about whether or not in the modern world circumcision is a reasonable is something reasonable to inflict on infants I don't want to have that conversation at all but I don't think that's relevant to this particular issue because we're talking about something different we're talking about humanity's attempt to reconcile themselves to the fact that something has to be given up in order something else to happen and to try to really work through that idea and to make it into a psychological reality and so far what we've seen in the biblical stories is that when you make a sacrifice it's not really something personal or psychological right it's something external and dramatic you give up something that you own you don't give up something that you are or that's part of you and it's actually more of a sacrifice to give up something that's a part of you or something that you are than to give up something that you own I mean it's a subtle distinction between because in some sense the distinction between what you own and what you are is subtle right I mean it's not overwhelmingly subtle but but people identify with their possessions and they need to because otherwise they wouldn't care for them and they need their possessions in order to live so their possessions are in some sense integral to them but this transformation here of an act that was external and associated essentially with possessions to something that was actually at least part of the body brings it much closer to it brings it much closer to the to the to the individual as a psychological reality it's something like that and you shall circumscribe is circumcised the flesh of your foreskin and it shall be a token of the Covenant betwixt me and you it's also a permanent marker you know and I've read a fair bit about practices like tattooing and body scarification you know which is those are very very common practices right they're human universals actually no matter where you go around the world you mean you see a couple of things first of all almost without exception people wear clothing and sometimes it's relatively minimal clothing but but it's and often it's more decorative than protective but it's almost inevitably clothing and the other thing that you see is that people do scarify and tattoo themselves and they do that in some manner to catalyze their identity right they're trying to transform themselves from a generic person in some sense to a person that's been designed by their own hand it's something like that they're it's a marker of developing identity and some of it seems to be catalyzed with pain you know that modern people who tattoo and I'm not saying that I'm in favor of tattooing because actually I'm not but that but that my own particular bias and if you have a tattoo that's fine with me I'm also not saying that there's anything wrong with it but one of the things you do see what we the people who have it to tattoo do report is a couple of things is that the pain is actually necessary and that the pain is actually something that seems to establish something like a memory so well it's a memory because of the pain because you plenty well remember things that hurt but it's also a memory because it's actually etched on you right it's not something that you can just abandon and forget and so a circumcision is exactly the same thing it's like you don't forget it because it's part of you and so it makes a good token for a covenant and so that seems to be the rationale here from from speaking from a psychological perspective it's to indicate as well that the the damn thing that's happening is serious and I think also that was the case with the earlier sacrifices of animals it's like modern people don't do this like you don't know how serious you would take a vow if you sacrificed a goat in your backyard you know it's actually a very dramatic thing to do you know you think about it as primitive and perhaps it is archaic and and and no doubt it is but it's also to take the life of something and to spill its blood that's no joke that's something you remember especially if you haven't done it before and we actually don't know what we would need to do in order to take some things seriously you know because we all do things like make new year's resolutions about how we're going to be better people and we don't do it and the reason for that at least in part is because we don't know how to make the sacrifice sufficiently bloody let's say so that we remember that it's necessary right we don't take it with seriousness we don't think I should quit smoking because I'm going to die and we don't think through what that means like coughing your lungs out for three months in a hotel bed well your entire family is like a half repulsed and horrified and sorrow stricken at the fact that this has happened far too early you know we won't make that real enough to make it serious and serious and without that seriousness we won't do it so there's something to be said for rituals of seriousness and I think this is one of them and he that is eight days shall be circumcised among you every man child in your generations he that is born in the house or bought with money of any stranger which is not a dice seed this is from Charles John Ellicott who was bishop of Gloucester the fitness of circumcision to be a sign of entering into a covenant and especially into one to which children were to be admitted consisted in its being a representation of a new birth by putting off the old man and the dedication of the new man unto holiness it's like a baptism that's right that's that's what's that's what's echoed there and of course baptism is returned to the pre cosmogonic chaos because that's what the water indicates and return to this source of life and and then the renewal that comes along with it so it's the it's it's it's a sacrificial idea in some sense that if there is to be a new you that the old you has to dissolve has to return to the solution from which it emerged initially and to reconstitute itself and so there's an echo of that idea here the flesh was cast away that the spirit might grow strong and the change of name and Abram and Sarai was typical of this change of condition they had been born again and so must again be named and though women could need be admitted directly into the could not indeed be admitted directly into the Covenant yet they shared in its privileges by virtue of their constant annuity to the men who were as sponsors for them and that Sarai changes her name equally with her husband well you could make a case and and anthropological observers have made this case to that women undergo a sufficiently a set of sufficiently radical psychophysiological transformations merely as a consequence of being part being feminine in nature such that the additional rituals of transformation that might be necessary for men aren't necessary and one of those might be menstruation because that's a pretty dramatic transformation and there has been some indication that circumcision is like a male it's like the male equivalent of menstruation something like that because of the blood that's involved and because of the locale and then of course the same thing is the case with women when they give birth because that's a particularly dramatic thing as I just witnessed because my daughter just had a baby this week so thank God for that [Applause] recent investigation this is from the Cambridge Bible for school and colleges which if you want to read it is only 58 volumes recent investigation is not tended to support the theory that circumcision has any connection with primitive child sacrifice nor again that it took its origin from hygienic motives apparently it represents the dedication of the manhood of the people to God in the history of Israel it has survived as the symbol of the people belonging to Jehovah through his special election this corporeal sacrament remained to the Israelite when when every other tie of religion or race had been severed the other thing that that I read about in relationship to this idea of the multi-generational covenant had something to do because God told Abraham to include all of the people of his household into this covenant and and that that that really meant that he was establishing it a territory of ethics around them like the ark except the psychological equivalent of the ark right so it was it was a spiritual or psychological or ethical territory that everyone who was of that household was required to occupy or obliged or perhaps privileged to occupy and there was also an injunction to Abraham with regards to his children which was that as he had established a covenant with God which we could say is something like his decision to to aim as high as possible and to live properly as a consequence it's more than that but it's something like that that he also was under the supreme moral obligation to share that with his with the other men in his family especially as children and so and so I think there's also a call here to adopting a sacred the sacred responsibility in relationship to children that has to do with ensuring that they understand how to take their place in the world and I think that that's definitely something very much worth considering especially given the emphasis in the Noah's story in the story of Noah that Noah had his that his generations were perfect right as I said before it wasn't merely that he had walked with God that he had perfected his own relationship with the divine let's say with the transcendent and I want to make that concrete which is a strange thing to do with the transcendent I mean people ask me all the time about what I believe and of course that's what I'm trying to explain while I'm talking but but but and and many people of course are skeptical about the idea of anything transcendent and and and say transcendent and eternal but that can also be addressed from a psychological perspective because I would say well if you have an ideal of any sort how is that not transcendent it transcends you that's the first thing and it doesn't exist in reality it exists in a place of possibility and believe me man we treat places of possibility as if they're real because people will call on you you know about your possibility in your potential they'll say to you you're not manifesting your full potential and you might say well what do you mean by that potential it doesn't exist it isn't here now you can't measure it or weigh it you can't get a grip on it and they'll say don't rationalize you know perfectly well what I mean when I'm talking about your potential and so we could and you do and everyone does and everyone knows exactly what that means and so that's a metaphysical reality that will immediately accept as real and also castigate ourselves for not fulfilling and others to like because you're just not happy when the people around you especially if you love them don't fulfill their potential you really feel that something has gone wrong and so there's a transcendent reality and potential and then when you hypothesize an ideal that you might pursue which you always do if you pursue anything right because to pursue something means you don't already have it you're pursuing something that doesn't exist you're probably not pursuing something that's worse than what you already have because why the hell would you sooo it right that's completely counterproductive so in in the mere fact of your pursuit you you pause it a transcendent reality that you can that you can that you can journey towards that's more valuable than the reality that you have now that's predicated in some sense on something like an eternal Verity or an eternal truth it partakes in the ideal and so we have an relationship with the transcendent and you might say well that doesn't mean you have to personify the transcendent say as Jehovah you know the God the Father but there's also some damn good reasons for doing that because one of the things that I've realized thinking through this covenant idea and also the sacrifice idea is that the idea that the future is a judgmental father is a really really good idea you know because you think about what the future is in part I mean the future is however the natural world is going to lay itself out over the next endless amount of time that isn't what I mean I think more about your future now mostly your future is the future that you're going to negotiate with other people but they're going to be other people in the future and some of those people are going to be you in the future and family members in the future and so what's happening right now is that if you make the sacrifices properly then you're actually pleasing that future set of people and that future set of people is definitely going to serve as a judge that's exactly what it does that's precisely what it does and so you might say well it was the brilliant imagination of mankind that hypothesized that the best way to think about the social group including the family but also including you as your future self was to consider that you live in relationship with a future father who's a judge it's like yes that's exactly right now is it right right or is it psychologically right well it's at least psychologically right and you know one of the things I've learned about the biblical stories is that to say that they're psychologically right doesn't exhaust the ways in which they're right but it at least gives rational modern people who are skeptical properly so a better way of getting a grip on them so and the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised that soul shall be cut off from his people he had broken my covenant so it's a serious contractual relationship now I was thinking about how to understand this and I remembered this old story which I'm going to read to you about a monkey so there's an old impossibly apocryphal story about how to catch a monkey that illustrates this set of ideas very well first so goes the story you have to find a large narrow neck jar just barely wide enough in diameter for a monkey to put his hand inside and then you have to fill the jar up with rocks so that it's too heavy for the monkey to carry away and then you scatter some treats around the jar that are attractive to monkeys and close to the jar and then you put a few of those treats inside the jar and so that's the first part of the trick and then the second part of the trick is the monkey comes along and gathers up the treats and then puts his hand in the jar and grabs the treats that are in there but it's narrow necked and so once the monkey puts his hand in there and grabs the goodies then he can't get his hand out of the damn jar and so then you can just come along and pick up the monkey and like too bad for the monkey rights like he shouldn't let go of what he had so that something terrible didn't happen to him but that isn't what the monkey will do because he can't sacrifice the part for the hole and there's something about the circumcision story that's about that it's about sacrificing the part to save the whole and I mean there's an echo of that in the New Testament if I remember correctly I believe it's I believe this is correct although it might not be where Christ tells his disciples to pluck out their eye if it offends them seems like a very dramatic you know piece of advice but it's it's partaking of the same idea which is that now if there's something holding you back we'll see this when we get to the story of law - if there's something holding you back even if it's beer to you you have to let it go you seriously have to let it go because there isn't anything more important than progressing forward and cheap sympathy cheap empathy cheap nostalgia none of that is sufficient none of that will work because the consequences of not putting things together immediately are dire and there's no time to wait and God said unto Abraham as for Sarai thy wife thou shalt not call her name Sarai but Sarah shall be her name my princess that was suraíh Sarah is mother of Nations and I will bless her and give thee a son also of her yea I will bless her she will be a mother of Nations kings of people shall be of her then a hebrew ham fell on his face and laughed and said in his heart shall a child be born unto him that is a hundred years old he's got a lot of doll I would say I mean there's God talking to him any laughs you know but that's okay that's he's a courageous guy and that's what people are like and and shall Sarah that is 90 years old bear and Abraham said unto God oh that Ishmael might live before thee and God said Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed and thou shalt call his name Isaac and I will establish my covenant with him for an everlasting covenant and with his seed after him and as for Ishmael I've heard thee behold I have blessed him and will make him fruitful and will multiply him exceedingly 12 Prince's shall he beget and I will make him a great nation now what does this mean this is this is a miraculous story in some sense right because well Sarah it's what the Isaac want or what Abraham wants most is to have a son but it looks like it's pretty much impossible and I I think what the story is attempting to indicate is something like god only knows what will happen to you if you put your house in order certainly things that you do not currently regard as possible will happen and the more you put your house in order the more things that you regard as impossible will happen and it might be the case that if you put your host together sufficiently things that were of miraculous impossibility would happen to you well and there's no way of knowing until you try it but there's no way of being sure that it's not the case unless you do and my experience has been that I don't mean just personally I mean that the world is a remarkable and mysterious place and the relationship between the nature and structure of the world and your actions is indeterminate they may be more tightly related than you think and I don't know how to square that with the fact that well you're obviously in a mortal body and constrained by all sorts of serious constraints and none of that none of that can be trivially overcome and I don't really understand how there can be that seriousness of mortal constraint and the infinite potential that also seems to characterize human beings all at the same time but then I don't really understand anything about the nature of reality so that's just one more mystery to add to the pile so but my covenant I will establish his Isaac which share a Sarah shall bear unto thee at the set time next year and he left off talking with him and God went up from Abraham and Abraham took Ishmael his son and all that were born in this house and all that were bought with his money every male among the men of Abraham's house and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin in the selfsame as God had said unto him that must have been an interesting conversation that's I mean really this is what God told you to do it like okay and Abraham was ninety years old and nine when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin and Ishmael was thirteen years old when he was circumcised in the cell same day was Abraham circumcised and his son and all the men of his house ORN in the house and bought with money of the stranger were circumcised with him all right so that's the renewal of the Covenant that's the next part of the story that's the circumcision that's the circumcision story and as I said it seems to indicate to me something about seriousness of intent something about the responsibility that Abraham determines to take for everyone that's part of his household the psychological increasing psychological transformation of the idea of sacrifice the necessity of doing something memorable and the the what would you call it the end the utility of rekindling the aims of your highest values when you come to the end of an epoch in your life when you have to take stock again right you take stock of yourself that's really what that phrase means to take stock is to take stock of yourself and to decide ok well what should move forward in time with me and what should be let go as if it's Deadwood and the more Deadwood that you let go of and burn off when you have the opportunity the less it accretes around you here's something interesting about forest fires you know people have been trying to prevent forest fires for a long time especially that damn bear smokey right he's trying to prevent forest fires and so because forest fires burn up the forest and that can't be good but here's what happens if you don't let forest fires burn is that well forests collect a lot of dry branches right because tree branches guy and wood falls on the forest floor and collects and so the amount of flammable material keeps increasing with time and that's not so bad if it's wet but if the amount of flammable material is increasing and it gets really dry and then it burns then you have a real problem the forest fire can burn so hot that it burns root does pop soil right off in which case you don't have a forest at all anymore you just have a desert and lots of trees are evolved to withstand forest fires of a certain intensity and some won't even release their seeds unless there's been a fire and so a little bit of fire at the right time can stop everything from burning to the ground and that's also a really useful insight a metaphorical insight into the nature of sacrifice right it's also a lot easier to let go of something when you're deciding to let go of it because you've decided yourself that it's you're done with that it's a weak part of you it needs to disappear you do that yourself it's much better and much easier than it is if it's taken away from you forcibly in which case you're very much likely to fight it these other there's another interesting thing here a motif that runs the entire Bible it's a very very powerful motif and it's partly associated with this idea of walking with or walking before God and you know in the New Testament Christ says something like thy father's will be done and he means that that will should be done through him and so I can't I won't build a state that's exactly right but it's something like this you know a lot of what people regard as their own personalities and and are proud of about their own personalities aren't their own personalities at all they're useless idiosyncrasies that differ them differentiate them trivially from other people but they have no value in and of themselves they're more like quirks I remember once I was trying to teach a particularly stubborn student about how to write and she had written a number of essays in in University and got universally walloped for them and the reason for that was she couldn't write really at all she was really really bad at writing and so I was sitting down with her trying to explain to her what she was doing wrong and she was being very annoying about it very recalcitrant very very unwilling to listen that was a pearls before swine thing you know and at one point she said it I can write perfectly well this university professors just don't like my style and I could see all my hands creep towards her neck yeah well then I'd be funny if it wasn't true but was also true you know and I thought what the hell's with you you can't even write and you think you have a style and normally do you think ya know not knowing how to write is not a style that's the other point right and so you know she she instead of humbling herself which was necessary and okay right cuz she was a new University students like of course you don't know how to write when were you gonna learn in school I don't think so so she had this you know this this this style issue and it it just it just didn't go anywhere at all and so now let's see I lost my train of thought and telling you tell me all those jokes oh yes in terms of above letting things burn off yeah well so she was proud of her insufficiency that's arrogance right that's not humility it's self-deception and arrogance to be proud of your insufficiency that's a very foolish thing and that means to cling to the parts of you that are dead okay now there's this idea that runs through the Bible I think as a whole that okay I'll tell you another little side story here I was reading about Socrates today and I was reading about Socrates trial you know he was tried by the Athenians for corrupting for failing to worship the correct gods and corrupting the youth of Athens by like teaching them stuff and asking them questions you know which is great way to corrupt people and so he knew the trial was coming and Athens wasn't a very big place only on about 25,000 people everybody knew everybody everybody knew who the powerful guys were and everybody including Socrates knew that the trial was a warning do you like get out of town right we're going to put you on trial in six months and the potential penalty is best got that it's like so so Socrates had a chat with his compatriots and they were contemplating fair means and foul to set up a defense for him so that he could or to leave so that he could not be tried and put to death and he decided that he wasn't going to do that and he also decided that he wasn't going to even think about his defense and he said why this is quite an interesting thing he said why he told one of his friends that he had this voice in his head a daemon a spirit something like that that he always listened to and that that was one of the reasons he was different from other people because he always listened to this thing it didn't tell him what to do but it told him what not to do it always told him what not to do and if it told him not to do something then he didn't do it if he was speaking and the little voice came up and said no then he shut up and he tried to say something else and he was very emphatic about this and he said that when he tried to plan to evade the trial or even to mount his own defence the voice came up and said no don't bother with it and he thought well what would he what the hell do you mean by that like there's a trial coming and I'm going to be put to death and well he eventually concluded that he was an old guy you know the next 10 years he was in his 70s perhaps the next 10 years weren't going to be that great for him he got a chance maybe the gods were giving him a chance just to bow out you know to put his affairs in order to say goodbye to everyone to avoid that last descent into catastrophe which might have been particularly painful for a philosopher and to and to walk off the world on his own terms something like that the point I'm making with that is that Socrates attended to this internal voice that at least told him what not to do and then he didn't do it and of course Socrates was a very remarkable man and we still hear about him today and we know that he existed and all of those things and so back to the back to the walking with God idea you know as you elevate your aim you create a judge at the same time right because the new ideal which is an ideal you even if it's just an ideal position that you might occupy even if it's still conceptualized in that concrete way that becomes a judge because it's above you right and then you're you're terrified of it maybe why you might be afraid when you go start a new job right because your this thing is above you and you're terrified of it and it judges you and that's useful because that's the judge that you're creating by formulating the idea tells you what's useless about yourself and then you can dispense with it and you want to keep doing that and then every time you make a judge that's more elevated then there's more useless you that has to be dispensed with and then if you recreate an ultimate judge which is what the archetypal imagination of humankind has done say with the figure of Christ because if Christ is nothing else he is at least the archetypal perfect man and therefore the judge you have a judge that says get rid of everything about yourself that isn't perfect of course that's also what Abraham that's also what God tells Abraham right he says to be perfect to pick an ideal that's high enough and you can do this the thing that's interesting about this I think is you can do it more or less on your own terms you have to have some collaboration from other people but you don't have to pick an external ideal you can pick an ideal that fulfills the role of ideal for you you can say okay well if things could be set up for me the way I need them to be and if I could be who I needed to be what would that look like and you can figure that out for yourself and then instantly you have a judge and I also think that's part of the reason people don't do it right why don't why don't people look up and move ahead an answer is well you know you start formulating an ideal you formulate a judge it's pretty easy to feel intimidated in the face of your own ideal that's what happens to Kane vs Abel for example then it's really easy to destroy the ideal instead of to try to pursue it because then you get rid of the judge but it's way better lower the damn judge if it's too much like if your current ambition is crushing you you know then maybe you're playing the tyrant to yourself and you should cap down your ambitions not get rid of them by any stretch of the imagination but at least put them more reasonably within your grasp you don't have to leap from point one to point 50 and one leap right you can do it incrementally but I really like this idea I think it's a profound idea that the process of recapitulating yourself continually is also the process of it's a phoenix-like process right you're shedding and all those elements of you that are no longer worthy of the pursuits that you're that you're valuing and then I would say the idea here is that as you do that you shape yourself ever more precisely into something that can withstand the tragedy of life and that can act as a as a beacon to the world that's the right way of thinking about it maybe first to your friends and then to your family it's like it's a hell of a fine ambition and there's no reason that it can't happen you know every one of you knows people who are really bloody useful in a crisis and people that you admire right those are all you can think of all those people as you admire that you admire us partial incarnations of the archetypal Messiah that's exactly right and the more that that manifests itself at any given person then the more generally useful and admirable that person is in a multitude of situations and we don't know the limit to that but people can be unbelievably good for things you know it's really something to behold so that's what God tells Abraham okay so the next story is about Abraham and these angels Ames will show up on his doorstep and this is part of the story of Sodom and Gomorrah but I don't think as I said this story is generally read as if it's about homosexuality but I don't think it is here I think it's about two things primarily one is how do you treat the strange so the strangest strange things and strange ideas and strange people and strangers right it's all about it it's that which is not you it's like the strange lands that God asked Abraham to move out into how do you interact with this strange and here here's one possible rule because you could say to yourself well what what do I want to make friends with more where do I want to be more comfortable do I want to be more comfortable with that which I already know and so that would be the circumscribed territory that you've already mastered or do I want to be comfortable with all those things I don't know and then the right answer is that you should want to be comfortable with all those things that you don't know because there is a bloody lot of things that you don't know and if you can be a Sojourner among what you don't know well then you're so protected because well you're going to go lots of places where you don't know and you're going to be able to manage it so you want to be you want to be that person that can act where they don't know and so also what happens with with Abraham well he's at home and these angels show up now we don't know whether they're angels or men precisely because well as this part of the story reads as the Lord appeared to him in the plains of Mamre and he sat in the tent door in the heat of the day so he's not a visionary state by the by all appearances and he lifted up his eyes and looked and lo three men stood by him there's real ambivalence in the story about the men are the three men are the three angels are the two angels in God it's all mixed up in the story so we won't clarify that we'll leave it ambiguous and I think the ambiguity is important because you don't know who the stranger is when you encounter them and it depends on whether you're thinking about it in the normative manner or if you're thinking about it in the transcendent manner because with each person that you meet well they're just a person that's one way of thinking about it and and then they're the person that you know or they're the person as they choose to reveal themselves to you and people keep themselves shielded but then they're also something of great metaphysical potential right and you might say well do you believe that and I would say well yes you believe it because you expect a lot from people generally speaking and are not happy if they betray you but more importantly our entire culture is predicated on the idea that each person has an indefinite intrinsic worth and I'm not talking about self-esteem I'm talking about something like the what would what would you say it the implicit presupposition in our legal structure that no matter who you are even if you're a murderer even if you're a condemned murderer that there's something about you that's of transcendent value that has to be respected by the law by the law and by other people right and so that's that's a remark net and you might say well do I believe that and answer that is well yak it out because you follow the law and it's not an easy thing to pull out of the law it's kind of the idea that you have intrinsic natural rights and you don't pull that out of our law man without having the whole thing fall down and I think the whole idea that you have intrinsic natural rights is predicated on something like the biblical hypothesis that human beings have a logos nature and that we are involved in the speaking forth of being and as beings who are involved in this speaking forth of being there's something about us that has to be respected by ourselves in relationship to ourselves by ourselves in relationship to other people but even more strangely by ourselves in relationship to even to criminals even to vicious criminals you can't remove that transcendent element and that's that to me that's also a mirror a miracle of conceptualization because who the hell is going to think that up right even the most vicious of murderers has a touch of the transcendent that needs to be respected of all the ideas that are unlikely that's going to top the list and of course without that you you have a very barbaric legal system right because no one is protected as soon as you make a mistake then you're in the Damned then you have no rights whatsoever and that isn't what happens in the West which isn't an absolutely amazing thing so anyways Abraham is a master of the stranger that's one way of thinking about it he knows what to do when strangers come along and he opens his he opens himself up to them and I would say he does that we know he's not a naive guy Abraham right he's no weakling a couple of stories ago he took a big army and you know went and harassed a bunch of Kings and took his nephew back he's he's a tough guy and so if strangers show up and he welcomes them it's not because he couldn't do otherwise he could certainly do otherwise and it's not because he isn't aware of what people can be like he's perfectly aware of what people can be like but he determines to take a particular attitude towards them and that is to welcome them and so and why would you do that and I think the answer to that is you hold out your hand entrust to someone and you evoke the best from them if that's their to be given so it's an act of courage it's like it's it isn't me meeting you exactly not exactly it's more like the transcendent part of me making a gesture that allows the transcendent part of you to step forward and that happens all the time it happens all the time in normative discourse you know this perfectly well because sometimes you can have a real casual conversation with someone that just goes nowhere right it's just shallow as can be or now and then you can actually make contact with someone right and you're both I would say enlightened and ennoble by the conversation and that's a de we would call that a deep conversation first for some reason because we made a deep connection whatever that means it means well it certainly means that it's not shallow we're not sure about what these metaphor means but it means that it reaches deep inside of you it's something like that you make direct person-to-person contact and those sorts of conversations are replenishing that that's the right way to think about it they genuinely are and I think that's because they provide you with that bread that's not Material bread and that's the information that you need to to thrive and to put yourself together and so it does matter how you meet someone and it does matter how you treat them when you first meet them and it's amazing I've learned to do this at least in part partly because I'm a clinical psychologist I've learned how to talk to people very rapidly and I have the most amazing adventures with people in cabs and when I travel because I'll talk to them directly right away and they'll tell me the wildest stories and show me the craziest things because I'm actually interested in what they have to say and I'm not afraid well I'm somewhat afraid but I'm not I'm not sufficiently afraid to have that stop me and I'm acting on the presupposition that the person has something of great interest to reveal and that's a very useful thing to know too because one of the things that's really cool about people and you really learn this as the clinical psychologist is that if you can get people talking they're so damn interesting you can hardly stand it you know because they have these idiosyncratic experiences that are only theirs right they're only theirs personally no one else could tell the story and that's the kind of stories that you want to hear and when they tell you those stories you learn something you didn't know and so what that means is that you can treat the landscape of strangers as an endless vista of places to learn things you didn't know and if you know enough so that you're satisfied with your life and everything has ceased to be a tragedy around you well then you could be comfortable in your circumscribed domain of totalitarian knowledge let's say but if you're if your life is insufficient and you're suffering more than you want to and everything isn't what it should be then you need to look where you haven't looked for what you don't have and then you can look outside beyond you and then you can make friends with what you don't understand and that's a huge part of what this story is about because what happens is that Abraham welcomes the men God angels and treats them very well and reaps a tremendous benefit as a consequence and then well then the story reverses and we end up in Sodom and Gomorrah where the same angels sojourn and they're treated terribly and all hell breaks loose and so that's what the story is about it's not fundamental now there's a there's a sexual impropriety thing going on that I'm also going to delve into but I don't think that's the critical issue in the story the critical issue in the story is how do you act in the face of the stranger you know there's a statement in the New Testament Christ says something like when you when you do something to the least of people you do it to me him right and that's a very difficult statement to understand too but it's something like it's something reminiscent of the requirement to keep the idea of the transcendent reality of the person in mind at the same time you keep their proximal reality in mind to have to have your mind in two places at the same time when you're talking to people you know I learned from a friend of mine in Montreal who is very socially sophisticated in some ways whenever went in whenever he went in to us always like going shopping with him and whenever he went into a store and he talked and he had an interaction with a clerk the first thing he would do is have an interaction with the clerk and he wouldn't have an interaction with the role of the clerk he'd like look at the person sort of take stock of the fact that they were there and then asked them something genuine about their job or their store how they were doing like going to a conversation right away and he didn't get personal about it because that can be intrusive right you have to be very sophisticated to do this but he did indicate to the person that he was there at least in part for the good that could be done between them it's something like that and then the person would be ridiculously helpful you know and and so then you know if people mistreat you you see this with antisocial kids it's a very tragic thing to see because if you're an antisocial child by the time you're about 4 you're very hostile and distrustful to people and so you'd like a growling puppy and if you're a growling puppy you can not to get petted you're more likely to get kicked and if you're a growling puppy and you get kicked and you have even more reason to grow and that's sort of the story of antisocial kids if they're not well socialized by the time they're four and they're more on the aggressive side then they alienate themselves from the community and all they get is rejection well and then they look at the rejection and they think well to hell with humanity you know and you wonder they think that but but the part of the catastrophe is is that they get what they evoke and I'm not saying it's their fault precisely but it doesn't matter that's still what happens and so you might ask yourself if you're not getting from people what you need there is some possibility that you're not approaching especially if this happens to you repeatedly across people and this is a virtual certainty if it happens to you repeatedly across people especially if you have the same bad experience with people it's not them it's you I would say three is the limit if something happens to you once you write it off if it happens to you twice it's like you open your eyes but you write it off but it happens to you three times it's probably you or it's the rest of the world better it's you because you're not going to change the rest of the world and he lifted up his eyes and looked and lo three men stood by heaven when he saw them he ran to meet them from the tent door and bowed himself to the ground and said my lord if now I have found favor in thy sight pass not away I pray thee from thy servant let a little water I pray you be fetched and wash your feet wash your feet take the dust from your feet extract yourself out from your journey write and sit and I'll fetch a morsel of bread and comfort ye your hearts and after that you can pass on for therefore are you come to your servant and they said so do as thou hath said and Abraham hastened unto the tent into the tent unto Sarah and said make ready quickly three measures of fine meal knead it and make cakes upon the hearth powerful call to hospitality here and abraham ran unto the herd and fetched a calf tender and good and gave it to a young man and he hasted to dress it and he took butter and milk and the calf which he had dressed and said it before them and he stood by them under the tree and they did eat some commentary from here Hebrews 13 to be not forgetful to entertain strangers for thereby some have entertained angels unawares this is a commentary from Matthew Henry with a nonconformist minister and author cheerful and obliging manners in showing kindness are great ornaments to piety though our condescending lord vouchsafe has not personal visits to us yet still by his Spirit he stands at the door knocks when we're inclined to open he deigns to enter by his gracious consolations he provides a rich feast of which we partake with him this is from revelations 3:20 behold I stand at the door and knock and If any man hear my voice and opened the door I will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me well a hyperlink nature of those quotes is quite obvious there's 10 or 15 things being said at the same time right one is a reference to the idea that if you ask for something it will be given to you right it was a very strange idea but I like that idea a lot and I believe my in my experience that has been true if it was that I wanted what I was asking for because that's the real issue right because the question is if you want something what does it mean to want it and what it means is to sacrifice whatever is necessary to get it because otherwise you don't want it and so there's an equation here and I'm not claiming its ultimate accuracy but the equation is something like you don't want it unless you're willing to sacrifice for it and if you don't want it you're not going to get it because you're scattered but if you do want it and you make the proper sacrifices then god only knows what might happen and that's a see one of the things I really like about the existential philosophers is their emphasis on personal responsibility you know that many of them had an emphasis on the role that people had in shaping their own destiny the exists for the existentialists and I think this was a consequence of the religious substructure of philosophical thinking it was self-evident that life was tragic and bitter but and then fair enough but that isn't where it ended the the next issue was well there are better in ways better and worse ways of dealing with that and the better way of dealing with the fact that life is tragic and bitter is to pause it the self you could be and live authentically in relationship to that and then the next issue and something is something Kierkegaard talked about particularly when he talked about the necessity of being a night of faith is that the thing is and this is I think part of the light part of life that's the intractable adventure no one can take the adventure of life away from you that that's they can't deal with good advice for example because no one can demonstrate to you that if you straight yourself out a name it what you want and make the proper sacrifices that your life will turn out in the manner that you might want it to turn out it isn't in anyone else's purview to make that judgment the only person that can possibly figure that out is you it's something that can't be stolen from you I would say it's your destiny it's a destiny that cannot be stolen from you and you can forego it you can say well I'm not willing to put in the effort because what if I fail well first of all if you don't put in the effort you will fail because life is hard and it takes everything out of you to do it properly so you will fail and if you make the proper sacrifices you might fail that's why I like the ambiguity and the story of Cain and Abel because we're never really told why God rejects Cain's offerings there's hints that Cain maybe isn't doing as good a job as he should and he certainly gets bitter about it but there's no smoking pistol it doesn't say well Cain is a bad guy he made terrible sacrifices so God rejected him you never know Cain might have been working pretty damn hard and things still didn't work out for them and I think that ambiguity is appropriate in the story because that imbued ambiguity is in life it you'd be a fool to say that everything always works out for everyone if they just do things right I mean I think that's a very that's a very careless thing to say given how much tragedy and catastrophe there is in the world and how much of it seems to be undeserved but that still has very little bearing I think on on your own individual adventure and the necessity for the necessity for opening the door to who you could be and the necessity to do that seriously and I do believe and I think I think that's why this most impossible of verses you know knock and the door will open why that's believable is that I have never met anyone who couldn't hypothesize a better them in some manner all they had to do was ask it's like well how could you be better I think well here's three ways it's like it's no problem right you can think about that no time cloud maybe it's small ways but you can almost always at least think of something stupid that you're doing that you could quit and so that means that you do have this it's a strange thing in people that we have this built-in capacity to pause it a higher self and then to move towards it and maybe maybe that's part of where the religious instinct really came from speaking like really reductionistic ly like as a materialist as an evolutionary psychologist we we have this notion of the transcendent ideal right that it seems to be pervasive across cultures well maybe that's the ultimate manifestation of the human proclivity to be able to pause it an ideal at all and to move forward you pause an ideal okay that you need that to move forward well if you can pause it an ideal why can't you pause it the ultimate ideal well if you can then instantly you've got a religious sensibility instantly and so maybe that's the kind of puzzles like as a biologist what the hell is the basis of the religious instinct because the idea that it's mere superstition like we can just dispense with that that's wrong it's a human Universal you can evoke religious experiences all sorts of ways so we're not going to play that game there's there's some reason that that instinct exists and this the first thing to do with it is to try to reduce it to something that's biological and leave it at that not to mess with the metaphysics but it certainly could be the case that it's the ultimate extension of our capacity to posit an ideal and we also might say well that's good enough because well the ideal moves you forward it fills your life with meaning there's no doubt about that because it is in the movement towards your ideal that life's meaning is to be attained and then the question is well how much meaning is there in moving forward towards an ultimate ideal well more meaning even though it's more difficult how much well that's the open question behold I will stand at the door and knock and if any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me that's a pretty good deal and the angel said unto Him where is Sarah thy wife and Abraham said Behold in the tent and he said I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life and lo Sarah thy wife have a son and Sarah herded in the tent door which was behind him now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age and it had ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women therefore Sarah laughed within herself saying after I am waxed old shall I also have this pleasure my lord being old also well she's kind of skeptical about the whole angel man God having a child at a hundred thing and and and and well write and so rightly so and the Lord said unto Abraham why did Sarah laugh saying shall I've Asura T bear a child which I'm old is anything too hard for the Lord at the time appointed I will return unto thee according to the time of life and Sarah shall have a son then Sarah denied saying I laughed not for she was afraid and he said nay but thou didst laugh and the men rose up from thence and looked toward Sodom and Abraham went with them to bring them on the way I'm gonna make a small detour and talk to you about this idea of potential again because it's really I've really thought about it a lot I think music speaks of potential like I think music speaks of potential bursting forward it's something it's something like that and that's why it's so deeply meaningful and and it's this continual pattern revelation of the next wonderful thing that might happen it's something like that so there's that and people find that deeply meaningful and then there's the idea that we all have potential that isn't realized but that we regard that potential even though it's not realized as real which I can't get my head around at all it just doesn't make sense and then although everyone acts that way and everyone believes it because what you act reflects what you believe and you make judgments about yourself and others based on those beliefs and their deep judgments so the idea that you believe that there is such a thing as human potential I think I think it's undeniable if you act at all if you expect things of people at all then you're demonstrating your commitment to the idea of potential but then I wonder if there's something even deeper going on because we are very materialistic modern people and there's great power in that obviously I mean we've obtained great control over the material world for better or for worse but we do have a tendency to think of the world purely as a material structure and isn't really obvious to me that the world is exactly a material structure it seems to be to be something more like constrained potential you know because everything is a certain way but everything that is a certain way could be a multitude of other ways in almost an infinite multitude of other ways and the degree to which something that is could be a multitude of other ways is dependent a large part on how you interact with it right even with materials that we're very familiar with we continue to discover new properties and put them to use it's like things are things are compacted into their material form but that doesn't exhaust what they are especially not in relationship to other things and so it seems to me even if you can't replace the materialist perspective with the perspective that it's better to construe the world construe being as if it's made of possibility rather than the world as if it's made of matter it's at least useful to have that as an additional viewpoint is that because you could say well the material philosophy is very useful as a tool for obtaining certain sorts of benefits which it clearly is but then this more metaphysical perspective which i think is more accurate in some ways that the world is a place of potential is also an extraordinarily useful way to approach the world and and it's practically useful you know what we talked last week a little bit about doing something as simple as trying to organize a room it's it's by no means obvious how much potential there is in a room right there's a very large amount of potential in any given room tremendous amount of potential especially if it's connected with people I think maybe an inexhaustible amount of potential and maybe there's an inexhaustible amount of potential everywhere and we just don't know how to get access to it well that's certainly true and it's certainly true to some degree we don't know how to get access to all the potential of our children for example or ourselves or our loved ones or it or or the people that we know so well so I think the this story is trying to hammer that idea home to which is don't be so sure that it's impossible or maybe don't let the assumption that's it's impossible stop you from going forth into the world that would be and that's a that's a what would you say that's like an inoculation against nihilism and I'm for a long time I understood nihilism very well I could I could understand its rationale associated with the tragedy of life associating with suffering and evil associated with the observation of finitude and the arbitrary and unjust nature of the world but the more I thought about it the less I've come to believe that there's any excuse for it whatsoever and I think the reason for that is that it forced all the effort it four stalls the ability to discover for yourself maybe there's no reason to be so goddamn hopeless except that it's easier to be useless now on a not believe me I'm not making that case I'm not saying that that's what's besetting people who are clinically depressed for example that's that's not my point clinical depression is a terrible thing there's lots of reasons to be rendered to be to be tossed into a catastrophic condition that isn't what I mean I mean that kind of cynical arrogant rational hyper-intelligent nihilism that throws the world away as if it's of little use before it's been properly engaged with better to engage with it and see what happens and better to make the assumption that if the world isn't returning to you what it is that you need then either you're not doing it right or you've conceptualized what you need badly why not at least open yourself up to that possibility right because you could be wrong hopefully if you're suffering this is a great thing to know hopefully if you're suffering you wrong because if you're suffering and you're right then there's nowhere to go so it's very useful to find out whatever errors you might be committing another thing that's really interesting about the Jews in the Old Testament it's a remarkable thing every single time they get flattened by God it's always their fault they never say the world that God created was corrupt and God is evil they never say that no matter what happens right no matter what catastrophe occurs when they have every reason to at least put that hypothesis forward they don't they say we erred we walked off the path it's our fault and that's hard you know because it puts all the weight of human capacity on the human being that's very hard but the outside is it gives you the control it opens up the door that it opens up the possibility that you could be the person that could set it right if you would just let go of what's in your way whatever that is and the men rose up from thence and look towards Saul to man Abraham went with them to bring them on the way and the Lord said shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I'm about to do seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great mighty nation and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in him I guess God is talking to himself here or maybe he's talking to the angels but I think he's trying to make a decision for I know him that he will command his children and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the Lord to do justice and judgment that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he has spoken of them and the Lord said because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great and because their sin is very Grievous I will go down now and see whether they have done altogether according to the cry of it which has come to me and if not I will know well we don't know what's happened in Sodom and Gomorrah but we know that God's got wind of it and that that's not good and we know that sin means to miss the mark and so we know that whatever has happened in Sodom and Gomorrah means that something about the natural ethical order of things has been seriously violated and there's a strong intimation in the Old Testament which I think by the way is completely correct that if the proper order of being is violated and that's something like the balance between chaos and order say if the proper balance of being is violated then all hell will break loose and one of the things I can tell you from reading a very from reading a very comprehensive set of myths from around the world is that that's a conclusion that human beings have come to everywhere stay on the goddamn path and be careful because if you start to mess around and you deviate especially if you know that you're deviating things are not going to go well for you and that idea is everywhere and I think it's right I think the idea is right because there aren't that many ways of doing things right and there's a lot of ways of doing things wrong and if you do things wrong the consequences of doing them wrong can be truly catastrophic you know one of the things I learned from reading Viktor Frankl first but then Alexander Solzhenitsyn who I think did a deeper job was that and vaclav havel thought the same thing that these people were very much trying to understand what happened in places like Nazi Germany and in the Soviet Union so schnitzel school like our Capello's caligo is a particularly good analysis of what happened in the Soviet Union and his conclusion and it's a 20 100 page conclusion and it's like hammered home with a hammer it's it's a book that everyone should read you know assuming that you can read a 20 100 page screen because that's basically what it is you know first of all what he does is document just how terrible things were in the Soviet Union between 1919 and 1959 and no matter how terrible you think they were unless you know the stories they were a lot more terrible than that and they were terrible personally because everyone lied they were terrible in families because two out of five were government and farmers they were terrible among friends because no one could tell each other the truth they were terrible socially because the whole system was corrupted ban on slave labor and they were terrible philosophically because the doctrine of man upon which the state was founded was hopeless and nihilistic and and they were murderous destructive and genocidal it's like they got it wrong at every single level of analysis simultaneously and the question is why and Solzhenitsyn's answer and to some degree Victor Frankel's answer as well and vaclav havel and I would say also Nelson Mandela and Gandhi they all they all ended up in the same conceptual sphere and the answer was because individual people lived crooked lives because individual people swallowed lies and spoke them and didn't stand up for the truth and the corruption that spread from each individual pulled the entire state mechanism into that corruption and made everything into hell you know there are other theories obedience right that's kind of the Milgram idea from that it's easy to make human beings OBD obedient to people in authority and I've explored that idea quite a bit with regards to what happens happen for example in the Nazi concentration camps yes you can set circumstances up so that people are likely to be obedient to orders that are pathological there's no doubt about that and yes sometimes that's indicative of the weakness of their character but that's not the issue and the idea that what happened in Nazi Germany was because a population of good people listen to a tiny minority of bad people that's a really that's really not a good theory the the the Nazi ethos was there at every single level of the social organization right right from the personal right from the personal right from the familial all the way up to the leadership it was the same thing all the way up and all the way down and the same thing in the Soviet Union and so well so if you miss the which is apparently what the people of sodom and gomorrha did their sin was Grievous than they risk destruction and I just cannot see how after the 20th century anyone with any sense could possibly not see that as true and I think that there's a line in the Old Testament you know that the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom and I can tell you one of the things that frightened me badly was the realization from reading Souls nets and and a variety of other things that I was reading at the same time that Dostoyevsky as well because he makes the same point he said that a human being is not only responsible for everything they do but for everything that everyone else does now you know that's crazy and he was an epileptic and a mystic and that's a crazy thing to say but it's also there's something about it that's true because if you were better the people around you would be less worse than they are and if you were good enough you don't know how much better the people around you would be and so there's this idea too you know that Christ took the sins of the world unto himself that's a complicated idea that I wrestled with that one for a very long time but I think I figured out at least in part what it means it meant that it's something like the realization of complete humanity you see to take the sins of the world unto yourself is to realize that is to understand the Nazi concentration camp guard because that person is human and so are you and so if you can't see you in that then you don't know who you are and if you can see you in that well then you've started to take the sins of the world onto yourself because you've actually started to take responsibility for those terrible things you know I think it's the motif of the the motto of the Holocaust Museum in Washington we must never forget that's close and I think well you can't forgive you can't remember what you don't understand you will forget what you don't understand and the question is what are you supposed to remember about the Holocaust historical event that six million people died that's not what's to remember what's to remember is that's what people can do and you're one of them and if you don't understand that you could do that then you don't know who you are so God's making a case here he's making a case that the people of the Sodom and Gomorrha have sinned and it's making a large racket that even God has heard about that's a very common mythological motif by the way that the sins and and and and what would you call it the sins and noise of humanity can read such a clamor that even the gods hearin and are forced to intervene that comes all the way from the Mesopotamian creation story so anyways it's logical yeah their sinning okay well so what well no not so what it means that God's offended and that everything is at risk that's what it means it's like that's a something worth taking seriously and the men turned their faces from thence and went towards Sodom but Abraham stood yet before the Lord and Abraham drew near and said will thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked this is a very interesting part of the story um friend of mine took me to task the other day when I was writing about portraying the Old Testament God is pretty harsh and judgmental and the New Testament God is sort of all loving which he isn't because there's the whole Book of Revelations thing but um but I got that partly from reading Northrop Frye but going through the Old Testament more detail I realized that that's that is too low resolution interpretation and that God who's dispensing a fair bit of harsh justice in the Old Testament it's also someone who can be negotiated with weirdly enough and that's what happens here you know Abraham has just been told that whatever's going on in Sodom and Gomorrah is seriously not good and that God's going to do something about it and he takes it upon himself this is an act of mercy to to ask God to be a bit more judicious right it's like okay you're gonna wipe out the city well bad things are happening there but you know there's probably a few people in the damn city that aren't completely corrupted by what's going on there of course that's an open question you know because it's an open question for example how many people were there were in Nazi Germany who weren't completely corrupted by what was going on in Nazi Germany and the same thing could be said about Mallis China and the same thing could be said about the Soviet Union it's like well perhaps there was a person somewhere who didn't and at some level what was happening but you know the whole issue of willful blindness certainly springs to mind if nothing else anyways Abraham decides to intercede with God on behalf of these people who are going to be destroyed he says will thou also destroy the righteous with the wicked perhaps there be 50 righteous people within the city will you also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty righteous that are there that be far from thee to do after this manner he's kind of reminding God that he's a good guy as far as I can tell to slay the righteous with the wicked and that the righteous should be as the wicked thought before from thee should not the judge of the earth do right and the Lord said if I find in Sodom fifty right he seems a bit taken aback here to me if I find him Sodom 50 righteous within the city then I will spare the place for their sakes and Abraham answered and said behold now I have taken upon me to speak upon the Lord unto the Lord which but I am but dust in ashes possibly there shall lack five of the fifty righteous will thou destroy all the city for lack of five and he said he said God said if I find there forty five I will not destroy it and Abraham spoke unto him yet again and said he's kind of sneaking up on God here huh her adventure there shall be forty found there and he said I will not do it for forty sake and he said unto him oh let the Lord not be angry and I will speak possibly there shall be thirty found there and God said I won't do it if I find thirty there and Abraham he seems really to be pushing his luck by this point says behold I have taken upon me to speak under the Lord possibly there shall be twenty found there and God said I won't destroy it for 20s sake and he said oh let the Lord not be angry and I will speak yet but this once perhaps ten shall be found there and he said I will not destroy it for 10s sake and the Lord went his way and as soon as he had left communing with Abraham and Abraham returned unto his place well there's two ways you can read that part of the story one is that three let's say you can bargain with God even if you're kind of annoying about it so that's kind of interesting the second is that even if there's a minority of good in a place that isn't good it won't be slated for destruction that's kind of a good thing and the third is a minority of good in a place can keep it from being destroyed and that's a really good thing too and I believe that as well I think that good is more powerful than evil naivety isn't but I think that good is and I think that in a place that's corrupt a minority of people who stand forth against the corruption can prevail now you know I think I think one of the best examples of that again was all Alexander Solzhenitsyn because he was in the terrible work camps when he wrote his book he memorized most of it which is not an easy thing to do when it's 2,100 pages long and set in very tiny font he memorized most of it and then he wrote it and it was one of the things that brought down the Soviet Union you know was published in the 1970s first of all in wet in the West and the first thing that happened at least initially was that the communism as an ethical system lost absolutely all credibility whatsoever among anyone who was even vaguely educated immediately upon the publication of The Gulag Archipelago he pulled the moral slats out from underneath it and the book was definitely one of the reasons there were many but was definitely one of the reasons why the rotten system crumbled and fell without a war and that's a great example of how one person can take on a tyranny and prevail so and he's not the only person who did that sort of thing because well Gandhi did the same thing I mean I don't think the English were the Russians but you know things were not so good in India and what Gandhi did in India under the influence by the way of Leo Tolstoy was also a remarkable example of a single person intervening in a catastrophe and and and and setting it far more right than it could be so and there came two angels to sought him and evening and lot remember Lauda's Abraham's nephew sat in the gate of Sodom and laud seeing them rose up to meet them and he bowed himself with his face toward the ground and he said Behold my Lords I turn in I pray you into your servants house and tarry all night and wash your feet and ye shall rise up early and go on your ways no he's Abraham's nephew and can spend acting in exactly the manner that Abraham does he shows hospitality to these people and they said no no we'll stay in the street all night and he insisted he pressed upon them greatly and they turned in unto him and entered into his house and he made them a feast and baked unleavened bread and they did eat but before they lay down the men of the city even the men of Sodom compassed the house round both old and young all the people from every quarter and they called him to Lord and said unto him where the man which came into thee this night bring them out to us that we may know them well that's the part of the story that's been used as a diatribe let's say against homosexuality because to know is to engage in sexual intercourse and the inhabitants of Sodom and Gomorrah we're willing to care the strangers out of Lots house and use and abuse them as they see self fit right and so what are they doing well they're violating the principle the principles that govern appropriate conduct with the stranger and maybe the stranger is something you shouldn't mess with because you don't know who you're messing with so that's like warning number one well they're violets are under violating the essential principles of hospitality and then there's the sexual thing here I think is isn't the sexual thing here is something more like the absolute danger of immediate gratification sexual included outside the constraints of any civilized structure whatsoever right because that's his uncivilized behavior as you could possibly hope for right strangers come into your city they're in the house of someone who's part of your city they're being shown hospitality a mob shows up and says four come over man we're going to do whatever the hell we want to them and it's not going to be good and if you get in the way things are going to go even worse for you so so that's what it seems to me to be it's completely dysregulated behavior its behavior that's outside the confines of any civilized structure whatsoever it's an indica it's an indication that the entire the social structure of the entire society has collapsed so that there's nothing left for the inhabitants to do except to engage in the most brutal of immediate gratification and destruction well so what does Lott do I pray thee brethren do not do so wickedly behold now I have two daughters which have not yet known man let me I pray you bring them out unto you and you do to them as is good in your eyes only unto these men do nothing and therefore for therefore came they the under the shadow of my roof well it's hard to know what to make of that you know I mean doesn't exactly seem like the advisable thing for a lot to do and but I think at least what it is is an indication of the degree to which he took the solemn vow of hospitality seriously and I think that's the idea that the story is trying to promote and the angel said stand back oh and the men said stand back and they said again this one fellow came in to sojourn to talk to us and he will need to be a judge now we'll deal worse with him than with them and they press sore upon the man even law and came near to break the door maybe what lot thought was something like well we're done like we're all done but this mob and perhaps I can spare some of us and they press sore upon the man even Lawton came near to break the door but the man this is the angels put forth their hand and pulled a lot into the house to them and shut the door and they smote the men that were out the door of the house with blindness both small and great so that they wearied themselves to find the door so they were so corrupt that they were blind and could not see now even to find the door and the man men said unto lot hast thou here any besides any family members son in law and thy sons and thy daughters and whoever thou hast in the city get them out of the place for we will destroy this place because of the cry of them is waxing great before the face of the Lord and the Lord has sent us to destroy it and lot went out and spake unto his sons in law which married his daughters and said up you get out of this place for the Lord will destroy the city but he seemed as one that marked unto his son and sons-in-law when in the morning arose than the angels hastened blood saying arise take thy way for ninety daughters which are here lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city and while he lingered lingered the man laid hold upon his hands and upon the hand of his wife and upon the hand of his two daughters the Lord being merciful unto them and they brought him forth and seven without the city so he still this is an indication of the danger of not acting with appropriate haste when the time has come I mean law it's already seen what happened he saw that the men came to his door he saw that they were murderous rapists he saw that the angels took them out and he still isn't to leave that place and so I guess one of the things that this story requires people to ask themselves is are you in a place that's so bad that you should leave or when are you in a place that's so bad that you should leave and if you are in a place that's so bad that you should leave then the time to leave is now because there's no time to waste and it came to pass when they had brought them forth abroad that he said escape for their life look not behind you neither stay thou in all the plain escape to the mountain lest thou be consumed and Lord said to them oh not not so my lord behold now they serve and have found grace in my sight and now have magnified thy mercy which thou has showed me into saving my life but I cannot escape to the mountain lest some evil take me and I die behold now there's a city near to flee unto and it's a little one which means maybe it's not big and corrupt like Sodom and Gomorrah oh let me escape thither is it is it not a little one and my soul shall live Matthew Henry said Lord linger he trifled thus many who are under convictions about the spiritual state and the necessity of a change defer that needful work and he said unto him see I've accepted the angel and he said unto him see I have accepted the concerning this thing also that I will not overthrow this city for the which thou has spoken the small City hasty escape thither for I cannot do anything to thou be gone hither therefore the name of the city was or that's where Lord went the Sun was risen upon the earth when Lord entered into Zoar then the Lord rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone and fire from the Lord out of heaven and he overthrew the cities and all the plain and all the inhabitants of the cities and that which grew up on the ground but his wife looked back from behind him and she became a pillar of salt no nostalgia for catastrophe I think that's what that means is that when you leave what's not good you wash the dust off your feet and you don't look back and that's a very harsh lesson this is echoed a bit in the New Testament the idea of the necessity for immediate action these are some of the harsher words that Christ said this is from Matthew 8 Christ is addressing a multitude and asking people to follow him and a disciple comes up to him and says Lord suffer me first to go and bury my father seems like a perfectly reasonable request but jesus said unto him follow me and let the dead bury their dead this is from Matthew 12 well he had talked to the people behold his mother and his brethren stood without desiring to speak with him and one said to him behold thy mother and my brethren stand without desiring to speak with thee but jesus answered the one who was telling him and said who is my mother and who is my brothers for whosoever shall do the will of my father which is in heaven the same as my brother and sister and mother well what does all that mean it means that there's no excuses whatsoever for not getting up and getting at it that's what it means and it means that it even means that when people are beset with a catastrophe like let's say the death of their father that they are prone to use that as an excuse for not going about the business that they should be going about because they can say to themselves well I would accept and accept there's always good reasons I mean believe me there's always good reasons for not doing what you should that's for sure the reasons pile up day after day to not do what you should especially because you're you're aiming at things in the future you can put them off and definitely right because of the demands of the day but these stories they say a variety of things you know in especially in combination they say when you leave somewhere terrible do not look back there's no nostalgia that's that's the letting the dead parts of yourself go and then if you're going to follow the good there's no excuse not to do it and that it means no excuse whatsoever under any circumstances and then it's taken even farther with regards to familiar relationships it is you can't even let them stand in your way and I think that's all true and I think I've seen virtually all of that in my clinical practice like there's no excuse whatsoever for not getting at what it is that you should be doing and I think there's something else that's going on here especially in the New Testament stories which is even made may be worse which is it's absolutely reprehensible to justify you're in action with a catastrophe that extracts mercy from other people right there's a tricky tricky game that's going well of course I can't do that look at the terrible thing that's just happened to me it's yeah okay I understand you're absolved of any necessity to move forward because of your current catastrophe it's like well actually you're not and it's rather rude of you to use it as an excuse and it's certainly counterproductive and Abraham got up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the Lord and he looked towards Sodom and Gomorrah and toward the land of the plain and behold and lo the smoke of the country went up as a smoke of a furnace and it came to pass when God destroyed the cities of the plain that God remembered Abraham and sent lot out of the midst of the overthrow when he overthrew the cities in the which lot dwelt and lot went out of Zoar and dwelt in the mountain and his two daughters with them for he feeler feared to dwell and Zoar and he dwelt in a cave he and his two daughters and the firstborn said unto the younger our Father is all and there's not a man in the earth to come in to us after the manner of all the earth come let us make our father drink wine and we will lie with him that we may preserve the seed of our father and they made their father drink wine that night and the firstborn went in and lay with her father and he perceived not when she lay down nor when she arose and it came to pass on the morrow that the firstborn said unto the younger behold i lay yesternight with my father let us make him drink wine this night also and gold out in and lie with him that we may preserve seed of our father and they made their father drink wine that night also and the younger arose and lay with him perceived not when she lay down nor when she arose thus were both the daughters of log with child by their father well it's like the story you know the story is outlined the catastrophe of sodom and gomorrah essentially the ethical catastrophe of sodom and gomorrah the dissolution of the civilized constraints that should regulate all behavior and then the city is destroyed but there's an echo of it afterwards right because laud had lived in sodom and gomorrah and what happens to him even after his escapes is that he gets tangled into an incestuous web and so I think that that's a it's not foreshadow its post shadowing if there's such a thing it's an echo of what it's an echo and a reminder of how terrible whatever it was that was happening in Sodom and Gomorrah was that even after escaping the iniquity still remained well that's a pretty good place to stop we got through two of three stories so that's not too bad next week I'll talk about the sacrifice of Isaac and see if I can get into the next stories as well and next week is the last lecture except I talked to the theater people and it looks like I'll be able to rent the theater once a month at least for the next four months so I'm going to do that and I'll announce when I'm going to do that and I'll continue doing this probably as long as you'll continue to come and listen [Applause] [Music] I could tell you something cool that happened to if you want so some of you may know that there was a memo leaked at Google how many of you know about that Wow law to you so a colleague of the man who released the memo got ahold of me yesterday and said that the man who wrote the memo wanted to talk to me so I interviewed him today I made a YouTube video out of it we went over his memo which was scientifically accurate in my estimation and so I'm going to release that hopefully tonight so we'll see how that goes he got fired last night eh right he got fired for perpetuating gender stereotypes he told me today that his last performance review he had been given superb which is the top few percentiles of the employee distribution at Google right perpetuating gender stereotypes I went through his document I don't think he said a single thing that wasn't substantiated by a fairly dense scientific literature not to say that the scientific literature is necessarily a hundred percent correct because it never is but certainly to say that he was not merely spouting out misogynistic and ethnically biased opinion quite the contrary so we had a nice discussion about that today and hopefully the discussion will continue so all right questions hello well it's great I mean look a couple of things about that I mean my my daughter has had a catastrophic life in many ways a lot of things went wrong with her physically really bad things and this went perfectly so like thank God for that so then and then the other thing is I love kids you know now infants well you know it's not that I it's not infants are cool and interesting but I'm not sure exactly what to do with them you know but once they're about six months old and then from then on like I love having kids around so I'm thrilled about the fact that this has happened so hooray you know hooray so thanks for that so more as an aside but what you said about not pushing aside the things the day kind of made me think of Nikes motto just do it yeah I thought cool but um my question was that when you were talking about circumcision being a contractual relationship between sacrifice and compared it to a girl having a period that didn't make a lot of sense to me but also it seems to me that it being a sacrifice requires some form of willingness basically from the one have extreme precision they don't necessarily want to put forward what you did you said you specifically didn't want to address as two infants not having any choice in the matter but more in the context of it being a sacrifice how does that I think I think that's how a modern person would see it and I think that there's some I think there's some utility in that but but it's it's it's an incomplete incomplete to some degree you know because one of the things that happens with God neighbor ham is that God tells Abraham that he has to take care of his family his children now the question is exactly how do you take care of your children and the answer is sometimes you make decisions for them now you might say well be better if they could make the decisions for themselves and that's actually the case so you might say well I won't bring my kids to church because it'd be better if they could make the decision for themselves that's what I did with my kids you know but I'm not so sure that was a good idea and the reason I'm not so sure it was a good idea was because there are a bunch of things they didn't learn now the degree to which a parent should exercise control over his or her child is indeterminate but I guess the hope is that you exercise the minimum amount of control necessary to maximize the child's probability of success and that certainly requires adopting responsibility for making decisions as well because the child can't make decisions you know you can't just let the child lay there and make decisions right there's that's just not going to happen and so you might say well Abraham has no right to impose something like circumcision on his children and because it and the and because it's a sacrifice it's something that they should be doing themselves but the problem with that is that Abraham also has no right to abdicate his responsibility to his children in the name of some hypothetical mercifulness and those two things have to be balanced well just according to the story Abraham got the balance right because of course he's made this covenant with God now exactly what that means in people's day-to-day lives well that's a harder issue but I would say I think in the modern world people err on the side of I don't know I think they're more likely to err on the side of taking insufficient responsibility for their children letting them be free in ways that aren't productive that's how it looks to me often because they're afraid of their children so that's about the best I can do without dr."

    "text": "Peterson I was recently I've recently started reading maps of meaning and there was something in the introduction to that story that I found particularly the introduction that you wrote before you went and tell them that I found particularly compelling I guess the part when you're talking about the split that developed in your psyche when you were you know yeah all your yeah I think he talked about it one of the earlier lecture I talked about it a little bit today yeah a little bit today as well yeah you said something in that paragraph there that what you said was you have to earn the right to identify with an idea yeah certain ideas for sure than ideas for sure so basically my question is how should a young person such as myself who doesn't have a whole lot of life experience like be able to like read literature and psychology and interact with you know the wisdom of culture and then incorporate it into a structure that still authentically their own well look I think the way you ask that question means that you're actually doing a pretty good job of that well I well I mean I mean that because that was a very carefully formulated question and it was obvious that you were actually looking for an answer instead of trying to tell the audience a bunch of things that you knew which often happens with questions right and it's alright often it's very annoying for the audience to be subject to questions like that right because it's a form of because it's a form of manipulation it's like well I'll cap this off with the question but actually it's a speech so so I would say you probably already know the answer to that and but then I could elaborate on that a little bit is like there are a lot of books that people have historically regarded as great you might as well start by assuming that they're at least greater than you right and then and to approach them with that frame of mind because even if there's much in them that perhaps is no longer relevant often less than people assume there's much in them that will be of extreme benefit to you and then with regards to making them yours the kind of wisdom that you get from great books is practical wisdom and you act it out and so then what you do is you try to incorporate what you learn into your life into your practices and then if you incorporate it into your life and your practices you build a bridge between you and the great idea right because you figured out how to manifest itself in the conditions of your own life that's something like making the archetypal personal which is which is the right thing to do right it's the proper thing to do because that expands your life upward and outward and in Nobel's you and brings you up as well but so humility is part of it it's like approach these books as if they have something to teach you and then it's humility again in the second places don't take the ideas to yourself until you live them there'll be lots of time for that and besides you know even as a young person it's not like you have nothing to say but the only things that you have to say are your things to say and it's not necessarily that easy to figure out what they are but as I said you did a fine job of that when you asked the question so I think I think as far as I can tell you already know what to do so good do it read everything great you can get your damn hands on hello dr."

    "text": "Peterson so a lot of your work a lot of your lectures recommend the audience tackle life with a lot of attention and intention and you know in my kind of personal gateway drug to philosophy has been more Eastern philosophy and like the bug hood gita and the work of Alan Watts and tower's Calvinism and what I've noticed I may be wrong but this is a common theme in Eastern philosophy which is more passive non action don't make as many plans I wonder how you reconcile that in how you are reconciling that because you mentioned earlier in previous lectures that you've read the TEL teaching how do you reconcile those two different views well I think first that the daodejing in particular isn't about inaction it's about minimal proper action and it's also about minimal proper action after a tremendous amount of sacrifice right so the sage that's speaking forth in the Dao de Jing has already let go of almost everything that he needs to let go of and a tremendous amount of what you're reading in the Eastern philosophies is predicated I think at least in part on the idea of sacrifice there's lots of things that you're grabbing on to like the monkey you know with the jar that's actually causing your misery and so sometimes letting go is the right way of moving ahead but to me that ties into this idea of sacrifice so now whether there's more than that whether there's more intentionality in Western philosophy and less intentionality in Eastern philosophy I'm not exactly sure one way of mediating between those two was was formulated at least in part by Carl Jung he pointed out that the archetypal figure for what the last died at 32 and so to some degree that outgoing extroverted let's say nature of the West is a consequence of its youthfulness in some sense it's useful ethos and that the East Buddha died at a fairly ripe old age and even in the Hindu practices if I remember correctly for many Hindu temples there's a lot of erotic sculptures an idea is something like it can't get past the damn erotic sculptures it's not time to go into the temple but it's more than that it might also be that if you're young it's not time to get past the erotic sculptures so maybe maybe there's a moving forward into life in youth and a letting go in in the latter part of life and that's well that was Jung's way of mediating between those two traditions I think they're tightly aligned with regards to the importance of sacrifice it frequently is the case that it's your desire Maya let's say your desire that's causing your suffering right and so there's an emphasis in Buddhism even more than in Taoism I would say on letting go letting go of what's making you miserable and but do you remember the thing about Buddha is that he got enlightened under the bow tree right he basically stepped into the City of God he stepped into nirvana and he could have stayed there but he chose to come back because he decided that he had a responsibility to rectify suffering in the rest of the world that it was not sufficient for him to be enlightened well everything else was left in a state of insufficiency and suffering and so I wouldn't call that inaction you know it's a I've made the mistake myself it's in action versus non action I actually had to look up that's that good that's well not - really the daodejing does a very good job of distinguishing between those two because non-action is the minimum necessary action to keep the balance between order and chaos proper right at the end in the egg and the Dao de Jing is very very emphatic about this you detach and you watch and when it's time to intervene you intervene minimally without a lot of arrogant self propagandize ation and you tap and if you do that properly you hardly have to do it at all and it's as if you're doing nothing and there's this great wisdom in that book I really like the Dow teaching it's it's a remarkable document and I've seen managers who were like that who are really good at running their company who did nothing Lauren but and what they did well but that but first of all they set up people to replace them because they're Dirk idea was well if I'm a really good manager then this place could run without me there's a real humility in that let me just kind of wandered around the place talking to people and if there was a bit of a problem then they just you know turned the knob the tenth of a degree and the place ran smoothly and it was as if they were doing nothing and what they were doing was detaching so they weren't being buried by their current concerns they were watching to see what was going on and then they were minimally interacting and that worked like a charm so I think that the I don't like the idea that all religious traditions are the same because that just makes them into like a gray mass but I don't see that there's any difference there that can't be bridged I think as you look into the details the bridge has become more clear [Applause] I'll get you to speak into the microphone especially when you're saying self-deprecating things let everybody hear you okay I much my pleasure what's happened what's happened to you as a consequence yeah yeah well our view seeing it that way anyways well mainly on I've had I've had whatever you say right it's something I thought but not had been able to articulate right so it's been very helpful in that regards and kind of saving a lot of time no yep good good good good my main question is actually on something you said a couple lectures ago it was something along the lines of a family um so I think I'm like god that's the history of your family kind of like the sims or your family something like that yeah be awed you're facing it all the time yeah what's uh how can you stand on that one well there's this idea in the Old Testament that your sins might be visited unto your family seven generations down seems kind of harsh but you know when you're confronting maybe your father's tyrannical yeah but you know maybe his father beat the hell out of him and maybe his father's father was a vicious alcoholic and he just bloody well don't know how far back that goes and and that means also you don't exactly know what you're dealing with right to some degree you're dealing with your father but only partly what you're dealing with is the pathological paternal spirit something like that and it's better to think about that way because it becomes an existential issue at that point you know so you could say that while the father has two components and I mean this psychologically speaking there's the Great Father that's beneficial and protective and that that organizes society and teaches you how to speak and has produced all these wonderful things and then there's the tyrannical oppressive part of the father just like there's the terrible part of mother nature that's destroy than the benevolent part of mother nature that's wonderful and productive and you're stuck with that right you're stuck with having to mediate between those opposing forces just like you're stuck with the adversarial part of yourself and the heroic part of yourself and it's up to you to set those things right otherwise they propagate into the future and it isn't it straightforward thing to say how to set them right there's quite a good movie about that oh now I will Magnolia which I really love it's by Paul Anderson if I remember correctly I hope that's right it's a beautiful movie and it's about this part of it's about this kid whose father's really pushing him to be a superstar at a at a crucial right he's a genius kid and the kid studies this guy named Charles fort you don't understand this movie if you don't know this because you got to know about Charles fort to understand Magnolia Charles fort was this weird old guy who got rich with an inheritance when he was like 20 and spent the rest of his life in libraries looking up impossible things and documenting them impossible things that couldn't happen from a scientific perspective that were well attested to by multiple observers and he produced this news paper called the 14 times which still runs anyways in magnolia magnolia begins with this guy who falls out of a building and then is shot by a woman who misses her husband with a rifle as he falls and I think she's she's charged with murder and the street names have something to do with the deaths and his fall and all of that happened and then in the movie there's a rain of frogs and there are rains of frogs from time to time sometimes they're frozen sometimes they're rains of fish sometimes they're frozen it's like what the hell how does that happen happens quite frequently as it turns out there's a rain of frogs in the in the movie magnolia and this little kid see what happened to him is that he's on stage and he ends up peeing his pants because of the pressure basically and humiliates himself and then there's this rain of frogs which he kind of takes as a sign from God and then he goes to his father even he's like eight years old this kid and he says you have to stop to be and he's dead serious about very careful not being you know what would you call insubordinate nothing like that he decides that that's coming to an end right now and you have to make those decisions in your family because otherwise things propagate down the generations right and every family is rife with pathologies of one form or another and you can learn from that and refuse to push it forward and that's part of I think what you do when you when you when you shoulder your existential burden because everyone is the beneficiary and the victim of the tyrannical father just like everyone is the beneficiary and the victim of mother nature and of themselves and so you lock horns with that and straighten it out one way or another and you don't move it forward to the next generation so and maybe you detach it a bit from your parents too because god only knows what combination of catastrophes culminated in their particular forms of pathology so good enough so this week we've had the Google thing there was the YouTube thing that happened last week what's going on with censorship and what should people do about it if you're in a workplace and pathological things are happening this is easy I can tell you how you know if pathological things are happening at your workplace or they're happening with you one of the two but you can straighten that out if you're being required to do things that make you weak and ashamed then stop don't do them like one of the things I learned from Solzhenitsyn and Frankel was that systems go terribly under out of control when people don't stop them when they're going mildly out of control you know when you might say I should just keep my goddamn head down and shut up it's like maybe you should like that's not bad advice you know you don't want to make unnecessary enemies and you don't need any more trouble than you need but you got to ask yourself on a day-to-day basis what makes you think you're not selling your soul you know and there's so much foolishness going on in the mid-level bureaucratic world now that's where all the tyranny seems to be focused and the reason that it multiplies is because sensible people say nothing when they should say something and what's so strange about that is that there are way more sensible people than people who aren't sensible they're just not as noisy so whether you'll turn out if like you know so let's say something's bugging the hell out of you at work well then you have to prepare to find another job that's the first thing you have to do I don't think that you should find another job but you should prepare to find another job and if possible you should prepare to find a better job because if you can't tell someone to go to hell then you can't negotiate with them and if and if they've got you over a barrel then you can't say anything so you going to you've got to set yourself up so you've got some ability and actually that's a really good principle in your life period you should set yourself up so that you have a lateral move at hand and you should find out well are there things at work that are disturbing my soul you know when you find that out first of all you ask yourself okay I'm disturbed at work okay I'm probably weak and deceitful and useless and lazy you might as well start with that and then you talk to some people like your your wife your friends your coworkers and find out are you stupid deceitful and lazy or is there something not-so-good going on at work and so if you if you can then eliminate your own personal pathology as a cause of your dissatisfaction then maybe there's something rotten in the state of Denmark and maybe you should say something about it before the whole goddamn thing collapses because that can happen it can happen in companies a lot faster than people ever think you know and you may find that well first of all you may find if you say something well first of all that's an adventure that's for sure that's a bloody adventure and you have to do it carefully and you have to be prepared for it it might be the best thing that ever happened to you and the other thing is if you're careful about it you get your words right like in this is a this is strategic battle right it's not something you wander into carelessly then you may find that there's lots of people who feel exactly the same way you do and that you've actually caught and gone to something you're a canary in a coal mine and not just some like psychopathic mouthpiece so you go to ask yourself when you go and do what you do like is this making you stronger is this making you weaker and if it's making you weaker then you got to ask yourself do you really want to be weaker because the weaker you get the more your tyrannize and then worse than that like the weaker you get the more bitter you get and the more you'll work towards terrible things the more you'll snap at your wife the more you'll kick your kids you know like it's no joke to be terrorized at work and so I would say you have an ethical responsibility as a citizen to forthrightly confront creeping tyranny no matter where it occurs and part of part of what we're learning I would say from these stories if we're learning anything at all is that if you're aimed at the good which is a question you really got to ask yourself you know if you're genuinely end up too good then take heart because you're a lot stronger than you think so I have a follow-up question okay so I'm speaking to there's lots of people who are in this situation like you know people at universities and corporations all over the place I you know Google is not the only company that is no unfindable what's the worst repressive freedom of speech denying workplace codes and everybody feels alone right they're all like why should I stand up be a martyr get fired this guy Google got fired yeah what's the point like I'm asking rhetorical no no it's a good question and how do you how do you convince people that there's a point to standing up when it appears to be futile well the first thing I think is you convince them that it's not futile it might be difficult but it's not futile if you get your words right you have something to say there'll be an impact of those words it might not be the impact that you would choose but but the other thing you got to tell people is pick your poison you don't you may be in a situation where you don't have you don't have a cake walk to the garden of paradise you got tyranny or famine those are your choices but you get to pick which one you have and I would say if if you're being oppressed and I mean in your soul by what you're required to swallow at work well you think you're not paying a price for that you have no self-respect and and rightly so but worse than that you're an agent of your own destruction you're destroying your own ideal and you're letting people who are weak and corrupt win and if you stood up and and stood up property but you have to put yourself in order to do this at least to some degree right you can't do it casually you have to do it from some position of preparedness and strength then what makes you think you couldn't scare them back into the corners and that would be a good thing and you know the alternative personally is bad because psychological degeneration that goes along with it I've seen this with many many of the people that I work with who have been terrorized in the workplace to the absolute detriment of their psychological and physical health right to the point of collapse confronting these crazy crazy things when they were sensible people that's a terrible price to pay man like it's it's a bad price and then if the foolishness isn't dealt with at the local level when it's still relatively trivial then it will multiply until it's dealt with at the social level and we're seeing signs of that already antiphon of that you know and problems that aren't solved multiply and soon people fight and you know better to argue than to fight unless you want to fight and some people want to fight and I can understand why but I wouldn't recommend it because that doesn't lead good places it really doesn't lead good places so I'd say you have a duty maybe that's that's where you stand up it's because you have a goddamn duty to stand up and say just say what you have to say if you don't even have to be trying to make a point exactly or trying to get something done it's like this is how it looks to me that's what that guy at Google did he wrote this memo and he said I talked to him today said well he went to a diversity training seminar and he thought no I don't agree with that and so then they asked for feedback so we wrote this document a month ago this was written a month ago got no real response to it but bounced around inside Google until a lot of people you know got interested and then it escaped into the outside world but all he was doing was he was told a bunch of things he didn't think were true he wrote down a bunch of things he thought were probably true he launched that out and said well I think these things are probably true it's like well probably they're true well so he paid a price for it but maybe we'll see what sort of price he paid for it man it's going to be a lot tougher in two years than he was two years ago so no they didn't answer his feedback no no but well you can watch the video the story's there but that's kind of the outline of it so sorry to monopolize this so I have one other question about this and I think it's important aside from Google just being a workplace right it also controls the own YouTube right yes which in order how is the new censorship scheme and it controls a huge amount of the information that people get then so true and so what happens to society when companies such as Google which control our information start to censor not just how about themselves and and maybe the information that's coming out to the rest of the world how much is this already happening and how much how about if we what happened how about if we refused to find out that would be good you know like I reviewed this this guy's document I did that yesterday and everything he said was validated by the scientific literature so what has happened is that someone has been fired publicly by major corporation for stating well-grounded scientific truths right there are exactly the sorts of things that I say in my classes for example and the reason that I say them is because I read the literature it's not because I'm personally happy about the facts I think I cube research particularly is so dismal that you can't possibly read it without being seriously disheartened if I could reconstruct the world so that IQ the IQ research wasn't true well it'd sure be tempting you know but that's not how science works science doesn't tell you what you what you want to hear it just tells you the way it bloody well is and he got pilloried for he got pilloried for revealing a good fraction of current scientific knowledge about gender differences okay that's not good and as you said that's a big company and it controls our communication how about we do what we can to ensure that these large communication companies don't get to impose a factually false ideological structure on the rest of the planet well you can think about supporting this this guy who blew the whistle there's a fundraiser for him online he could use some money he wants to sue Google yeah you know maybe we could maybe we could let them know that hiring a human resources director who's also concerned with equity is probably not a good idea for capitalist company why in the world would you hire your own enemies I don't understand that so well we'll see how the dialogue continues but back to the personal like you need to say what you think because that's where you come from right and if you don't say what you think then you kill your unborn self that's what you do that's what Cain did when he killed Abel and that's why his punishment was unbearable you know you have things in you that are struggling to come to the light that's the truth you need daughter and you need to either that truth because without that truth you cannot live in the world because the world is real and you need truth to live in the world and if you stifle your truth well how how can that be anything but something that brings about hell how could it be any other way so you think well why should you speak up that's easy because the consequences of not speaking up although delayed are far worse that's the reason that's the reason if it can't be courage it could at least be prudence so yeah one more dr."

    "text": "Peterson first of all kudos for mentioning magnolias in my favorite movie that's a great movie man so a few months ago I had a dream and when I told someone this dream they suggested that I read the Book of Revelations oh yeah that's a bad dream that the there's a lot of interesting stuff in that book the thing that really that I found really interesting right off the bat was the the state is represented in two instances as female positively and negatively and I was wondering if you had any thoughts on that in the context of like in maps of meaning you often talk about the state just as as male or as masculine okay first of all I'm going to comment on your t-shirt that's a lobster hierarchy with Horus at the top isn't it it's even better it's the eye of a lobster so that's one that we found yeah that's a good one that's a good one that one really cracked me up when I saw it I really thought that was funny man yeah yeah yeah when my graduate students used to meet when I first talked about this Lobster stuff we meet for breakfast day and they were a very combative snappy group of graduate students and they're always trying to one-up each other with jokes and whenever one really pulled a good joke on another they'd stand up and like it was really it was really funny it was really funny okay let's see can I answer that question you know how if you're looking at a if you look at a room every color that you see is dependent on every other color in the room right your eyes adjust to that so for example if you're in a room based with red light your eyes will in some sense remove the red so you can still see the colors okay so your perception is to some degree on-call is to some degree dependent on Khan context and that's one of the things that makes the symbolic symbolic interpretations tricky because to see how something is represented symbolically you actually have to look at the broader narrative context within which the symbols are embedded so for example you see if I can get this right if the story has an island and an ocean then the ocean is often symbolically feminine and the island is symbolically masculine but if the story's the island and the sky then Island often becomes symbolically masculine and feminine and the sky symbolically masculine and you might think well how can the island be masculine and feminine at the same time and the answer is well it depends on what what it's being contrasted with and why and so that's part of the key to the change in symbolism in the book of Revelation and so it isn't inevitably the case that culture is represented with the patriarchal symbolism but it's most commonly the case so you know there is Mother Russia for example I guess it would depend to some degree to on what your metaphor is for the state because the state can be in all providing mother or it can be a judgmental father and it it seems that we killed more towards the father with regards to terminology relating to the state and I think the reason for that is because I think human hierarchies like chimp hierarchies are fundamentally masculine the fundamental hierarchy is masculine even with chimps there's a female hierarchy but it's like the female hierarchy is nested within the male hierarchy it's not the case with bonobos exactly but I think it is the case with human beings and so I think we have a strong proclivity to masculinize the state but that doesn't mean there aren't exceptions and in symbol symbolic representations are very slippery that way because you can't stamp an entity with a symbol because that would be the same as just giving it a name right and you can't have a dictionary of symbols where you say well you know a house always means the psyche it's like know sometimes the house means the psyche but it depends on the story and so you have to take the the entire structure of the narrative into account to determine why those particular symbolic representations are being used what I offered in maps a meaning was kind of a shorthand you know generally speaking there's nature positive and negative usually feminine generally speaking there's culture positive and negative usually masculine and generally speaking there's the individual good and evil right heroic an adversarial often typically represented as masculine especially in adventure stories but it's a schema and it's an interpretive guide and not a set of hard and fast rules because you're in the domain of metaphor and it's a it's a slippery domain so you have any luck figuring out your dream sorry did you have any luck figuring out your dream at least in some parts I think there's different levels of analysis I mean one was pretty obvious yeah all right all right well thank you very much everyone [Applause]"

Thank you again for showing up, so tonight We're going to finish off the story of Noah and also the story of the Tower of Babel and I don't think that'll take very long and then we're going to turn to the abrahamic Stories and They're a very complex set of stories. They sit between the Earliest stories in Genesis that I would say end with the tower of babel And then the stories of moses which are extraordinarily well-developed Abrahamic stories, there's a whole sequence of them multiple stories conjoined together and There I found them very daunting they're very difficult to understand and so I'm going to stumble through them the best that I can I would say that's that's probably the best way to think about this because they Have a narrative content."

I'm not exactly sure how to conceptualize it, but that appears to be causally linked is that? the Stories about individuals become more and more well-developed so it says in it's as if as God fades away, so to speak the individual becomes more and more manifest and There's a statement in the old testament the location of which."
